["Q: What is SimStreamProcessorService? When you click on the battery in the menu bar in OS X it shows you how much battery power you have left. It also shows the processes that are using the most battery power. \nBut last week a process called SimStreamProcessorService showed up in that list. I don't know what that does. When I open up the activity monitor it does not show up in there, which means I can't shut it down. So I wanna know if this is malware or not.\nDoes anyone know what SimStreamProcessorService is/does?\n\nA: I had SimStreamProcessorService grabbing 33% of my CPU and a lot of memory. But at the time I also had an XCode simulator starting up for the first time, and the \"iOS OS\" was starting up in that simulator. Once the simulator came up to the home page, the SimStreamProcessorService stopped running.\n", "Q: How/Where do I drag an mp3 file from my pc to iphone?

I recently replaced fusion drive with a 1TB SSD and a 2TB disc Hdd as two separate internal drives. I restored using Time machine Backup from an external drive (which I curiously found to have been formatted Journaled Case Sensitive). I purchased a 5TB Seagate Backup+ Plus Hub external drive. As instructed I formatted it as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) as I usually do to set up a drive for time machine. It has been over 13 hours and it has only backed up 285GB of 1.6TB. I believe that using 3.0 hub should be much quicker. Yesterday after a similar event I stopped the BU and reformatted the drive and started the process over with stated results. Suggestions?\n\nA: You mention that you thoughts a USB3 hub would be faster, do you have the Seagate drive connected directly to the Mac mini? Do you have anything connected to the USB ports on the front of the Seagate (the included USB hub)?\n", "Q: How to get input volume level value in mac?

I was just looking at that code and thinking \"it would push you to the right direction\". Kinda like, if there is a piece of code that is like get window width... and I wanted the height instead, then the logical step is probably get window height.\nI did come back to this before, but I thought someone answered this already...\n\nHere are some examples of setting input volume.\nYou can find get volume settings documentation here.\nInput Volume\n-- Get input volume\ninput volume of (get volume settings)\n\n-- Set input volume\nset volume input volume 40\n\n-- Increment input volume (+)\nset volume input volume ((input volume of (get volume settings)) + 5)\n\nOutput Volume\n-- Get output volume\noutput volume of (get volume settings)\n\n-- Set output volume\nset volume output volume 40\n\n-- Increment output volume (+)\nset volume output volume ((output volume of (get volume settings)) + 5)\n\nYou can test these in the /Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app. If you stick this: return (get volume settings) at the very  end, after you've set volume levels, the result panel will give you the current values at the bottom of the window.

My MacBook Pro got stolen, and I have file vault enabled but not the Firmware password, too strange on Apple's part not to set it on by default when you set a user password or at least to raise awareness about it. I'm an advanced user but never thought about the firmware password.\nAnyway, my biggest fear now is that the thief can erase the disk using recovery mode, reinstall macOS and have a new apple id configured, allowing him to bypass the \"find my iPhone\" notification and lock.\nIs that doable? If so, that redeems the whole anti-theft features of \"find my\" worthless!\n\nA: Sorry, you're out of luck. If they boot into recovery mode, they can wipe the drive without going online. Even if they went online, your iCloud information is stored on the encrypted, unmounted drive so the recovery OS isn't going to log in to your account and report the location anyway.

To put things into order, I thought about utilizing Time Machine for backups and restores. \nIf after wiping the disk the created macOS partition is smaller than the previous one, will I be able to have a successful restore (assume that the real old data fits in the new partition)?\n\nA: Time Machine is a file-level backup so the size of your partition will not be taken in to account.\nIn fact a block-level backup also would not be an issue, only taking a disk image would be problematic as a disk image includes the file system whereas backups do not.\n", "Q: What is the difference between formatting a volume partition and a disk of which the volume partition is a part of?

Any help is appreciated.\nThanks in advance..\n\nA: If your app is in fact targeting both employees and people external to the company, then the Public App Store is your only choice anyway. All other options like VPP or the Apple Developer Enterprise Program do only allow you to distribute apps to employees. So your argumentation towards Apple would be that it needs to be the public store, because there is no other way to distribute that app to a potentially global audience.\nHowever they might not like your authentication method \"unique code\", as Apple usually wants apps to have a signup method and a more sophisticated login, such as username and password.\nAdding some external (publicly visible) content near the login might help to get the App approved as well.\n\nA: Beware that the VPP program limits you to one country. That of the developer.\nSo if you want to distribute your app via the B2B and VPP program, you are stuck with ONLY the country where your developer account business is registered.\nApple has NOT (since the program was launch 5 years ago) figure this out yet.\nIf you read https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/72073 you will get the picture.\n", "Q: Energy usage when iMac not in sleep mode, but screen/HDD off/idle I have an iMac 21.5\" from 2016. For several reasons I want to have the iMac available for logging in via Splashtop and some other over-the-internet access. Afaik I can't use sleep mode.\nHow much more energy will the iMac use when not in sleep mode, but assuming screen is off and hard disk is idle?\n\nA: You can find the power consumption specifications for your model in the respective Environment Report from Apple at https://www.apple.com/environment/reports/\nFor your Model, it states \"Idle—Display on 37.7W 38.8W 38.3W\" for \"100V 115V 230V\" respectively.\nTo get a rough idea about the effect of turning the screen off : on 230V, my iMac runs at 0.85A at full brightness, at 0.465A at minimum brightness and 0.4A with the screen turned off. You will save some power when you disconnect all USB devices and the network cable, but it's rather irrelevant. \nNo, not using sleep mode does not have any other major consequences afaik.

I believe the highest level iOS on an iPhone 4S is 9.3.5.\nWhat is the limiting factor is further upgrades? What service or capability does not exist on the 4s which is needed for higher levels?\n\nA: It's impossible not to speculate here when you are not an engineer with the needed knowledge at Apple. I'd suggest reading this article from iMore about the iPhones chips and SoC's. You want to search for the A5 (from the 4S) and A6 (from the iPhone 5) and read about the significant increase in performance (which I think is the reason for the 4S being obsolete for new iOS's)\nSorry for speculating.

The inheritbackup verb reassigns the identity of the specified item, reconfiguring it so the current host recognizes it during backups. When inheriting a sparsebundle, the machine directory within will also be claimed.\n\nThis performs automatic inheritance of the computer and disk backups located within. This may not function correctly. If not, you may need to manually associate the disk within the backup with your current disk.\nsudo tmutil associatedisk -a \"/\" \"/Volumes/backupdisk/Backups.backupdb/computername/Latest/localdiskname\"\n\n\nThe -a option tells associatedisk to find all snapshot volumes in the same machine directory that match the identity of MyStuff, and then perform the association on all of them.\n\n", "Q: MacBook keeps switching between my 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz wifi networks for no reason I have my router setup with 2 frequencies:\nWhen I'm near the router, I'm connected to the 5Ghz wifi network. \nBut when I go into my bedroom, I am switching to the 2.4Ghz network because the 5Ghz signal is too weak at that distance (barely getting any speed).\nSo I manually switch to the 2.4Ghz, but my MacBook automatically changes back to the 5Ghz network.

I have a 3-hour long .mp4 video that has sensible breaks roughly every 30 minutes or so.  I want to export this into multiple videos of each section, but have run into nothing but problems trying to do so.  This isn't something I do often so I don't really want to invest in commercial tools for this one task, but as yet I can't find any free tool capable of this job.\nI really would prefer to just cut this up without having to decode and re-encode the file(s) all over again.  I'd like to just mark the sections I want, and spit them out as standalone .mp4s.  No other edits, no corrections, no effects, no anything... just cut & export without any formatting changes at all.\nI thought Handbrake could do this, but if it can I can't figure out how.  I then thought maybe iMovie (10.x as I'm on Mavericks), but that's been nothing but headache and appears to decode the entire movie first before working with it anyway.  Quicktime itself seems only able to direct export as .mov and I don't want to re-encode to mp4 all over again.\nI keep running into free/open source programs that either are only free in a very limited fashion (like 5 minute max exports, or nasty watermarks, etc.) or that won't run on Mavericks.  Is what I'm looking to do just not possible without commercial software?  Is it really so difficult to split one long mp4 into several shorter ones?\n\nA: Here's a tutorial I just made to solve the problem. No pro subscriptions, no nonsense. \nQuickTime Export Split Clip Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7MgVBGfFCo\nEssentially, you just use the shortcut to split the clip, move the split over to a new file, and save the new file. Quick and easy. Split up an over hour long video into 13 videos or so [1] in 15 minutes. \n[1] https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3z1TiLmRFcwBvXbeSmXhYbouKfBKZyZv\n\nA: I just found out about LosslessCut - it's a free open-source front-end to ffmpeg. In (minimal, so far) testing, it seems to work well - splitting an .mp4 containing subtitles, into smaller chunks, preserving all tracks (including subtitles) while doing so (or only some tracks if you want to exclude some), without transcoding.\n\nA: This can be done using QuickTime Player X.\n\nQuicktime itself seems only able to direct export as .mov and I don't want to re-encode to mp4 all over again.\n\nIf you only Trim the video, or (repeatedly) Split and then delete one of the ends, you can re-save as .mp4 rather than exporting as .mov. If you do anything more than that, you must export.\nI posted directions for that here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/370211/19829\nQuickTime 7\nIt's even easier using QuickTime Player 7 Pro:\nExtract a Trimmed segment into its own QuickTime player:\n\n*\n\n*Open your Source video file in QuickTime 7 Pro.\n\n*Scrub to the first desired frame.

Thanks to this post from another forum, I discovered that you can tell QTPro to simply \"pass thru\" and not re-encode your material, when exporting.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*You must have QuickTime 7 Pro.  Might also require a license key if you don't already have one.  You will have to get these on your own as QT7 has been discontinued for years by Apple, but it's very  much still out there.\n\n*Open your original (large) movie in QT7.  \n\n*Move to the point you want your first clip to start, and press \"I\" to mark an in point.  Move to the end of the clip and press \"O\" to mark the out point.\n\n*COPY the now-selected section and select File > New Player (or hit COMMAND-N)\n\n*PASTE what you previously copied, onto the new clip.\n\n*Select File > Export... (NOT Export for Web...)\n\n*Make sure Movie to MPEG-4 is selected as the export type, and click the Options button\n\n*Make sure \"Pass Through\" is selected for both audio and video, and enable Streaming options if you need them.\n\n*Export your file where you want it.  QT7 will pretty quickly generate the new file, so fast that it is very obviously not re-encoding.  Should only take a few minutes at most.\n\n*Rinse & repeat for as many clips as you have in the larger movie.\n\n*Enjoy your new clips!\n\n\nA: Everything you need is already pre-installed.

Almost all of my email calendar invites appear in my non-Apple email that eventually gets routed and delivered to Gmail and by me to my Google Calendar, however, for some individuals, none of their invitations come through email but instead show up in iCal as transient popup notifications, despite their inviting me with my email address.\nI have a hypothesis that when they invite me using the same email address of my Apple ID and they are on some Apple device such as a laptop or iPhone, that Apple sees the email and matches it to my Apple ID and decides to short circuit the email invite (never sending it) and instead just populate directly to my iCal.  I haven't tested this hypothesis because I think it would involve asking one of the few people I have this difficulty with to take the action and did not want to impose upon them if I could avoid it.\nDoes this hypothesis make sense, or if not, what else could be going on here and how can I stop this from happening?  My end goal here is that I get an email invite in all cases and never have my iCal automatically pre-populate.  My reason for this desire is that I do not use iCal but instead use Google Calendar and I end up missing these invites all together.  Maybe it is as simple as just changing the email address for my Apple ID to be an address that I never get calendar invites for?\n\nA: Your hypothesis is very close to reality: it seems (based on ArsTechnica article) that the default settings in Apple's iCloud calendar service automatically push calendar alerts to Apple iOS and macOS users and bypass e-mail entirely.\nThe same article describes how to change the settings.\n\nVisit your iCloud account via a Web browser.

It appears in the Applications folder stack on my dock as \"Rayman® Origins\"\n\nThat small registered symbol looks pixelated and ugly on my non-retina screen. So I opened my applications folder in Finder in order to rename the application.\nIf I rename the app to \"Rayman Origins1\", it appears fine. Likewise, if I rename it to \"RaymanOrigins\", the name changes as I would expect. However, I cannot seem to rename the app simply \"Rayman Origins\". Although Finder lets me type in the name, as soon as I hit enter, it snaps back to \"Rayman® Origins\" with a registered symbol.\nWhat gives?\n\nA: When the app name is the same as the CFBundleName, the CFBundleDisplayName is used.\nTherefore it would seem the CFBundleName is ‘Rayman Origins’, and when the app has this name, the CFBundleDisplayName is used, which appears to have a ® in it.\nTo remove the ®, open the package contents (right-click on the app from Finder and choose Show Package Contents), then navigate to Contents/Resources and open InfoPlist.strings with Xcode and change the CFBundleDisplayName to your desired name.\nBackground: This is meant for localisation but also allows for fancy things like naming the macOS ‘Wi-Fi’ instead of WiFiAgent.\n", "Q: Do I have to restart the Apple Store iOS app at 3:01 AM? When the Apple Store goes down for maintenance in anticipation of a preorder about to go live, if I were to have the Apple Store iOS app open during that time, would the \"We'll be back\" screen automatically disappear when the time comes to preorder those items, or would I need to force-restart the app for the change to take effect?\n\nA: In 2016, I had to force-close and relaunch the Apple Store app for it to show the new contents. I know this because refreshing Safari showed me the updated Apple Store ordering pages, while the app was still showing, “We’ll be right back.” There is no way to force the app to refresh itself, so relaunching it is the only option if you’re in a hurry.\nMaybe that’s been fixed since (I didn’t preorder right at midnight for iPhone 8/WATCH 3), but if in doubt, keep force-closing and relaunching (or refresh Safari until you know the Store is back up; however the web version of the site has occasionally come back up after the app version).\nDo keep in mind that in 2016, the Apple Store came back online long (15 minutes?) after the carriers went live with preorders. In fact, AT&T (and possibly others) even started a first-come, first-served queue 5+ minutes before midnight.\nLastly, if the iPhone 8 and WATCH 3 launch is any indication, a number of phones will be reserved for local pickup. You should be able to verify that many models  that are on delivery-backorder are still available for local pickup on September 22nd. I’m guessing Apple did this to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Draw larger launch-day crowds to the stores.\n\n*Mitigate the advantage of living farther west (and only needing to wait until midnight, as opposed to waking up at 3 a.m.).\n\n*Save on shipping?\n\n\nIt is already possible to select an iPhone X model and add it as a favorite in the app. If you want to maximize your chances I would advise you to do this, then set it as the item on display under Account → My Favorites. Come preorder time, tap on it, then go straight to confirm your order.\n", "Q: How can I monitor usage of an iPad that is probably stolen? Someone may have stolen my iPad mini 2, or I've misplaced it. Checked on find my iPhone, and it shows up, but it stalls on \"locating...\" So, now I'm thinking how can I show use of the iPad via all the synced apps I have? It has cellular, and I can see data usage via my ISP, and it only shows my last known usage, nothing recent. I'm looking for a meta data solution to prove current use. If I can prove current use, then I know who has it. If it's just lost or misplaced with a dead battery or something, then nothing will show up.\n\nA: If the isp has no data, you aren’t likely to get any better alternate than Apple lost mode / find my iPhone and pings from the cellular network. \nIf you truly think it’s stolen, consider filing a police report and send that to the carrier and ask for any pings. \nYour reasoning is sound about the battery dead situation. In a few days, you’ll likely never hear again until someone powers it up or charges it near WiFi or cellular coverage. \n", "Q: Automator Keeps Opening Multiple Untitled Files Exactly what the title says. Whenever I open Automator, by clicking on its icon, it keeps opening multiple files (Untitled, Untitled 2, Untitled 3). When I attempt to close them it asks me if I want to save changes for each one. This is incredibly annoying. Does anyone know how to stop this? \n\nA: Delete the Saved State files.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Automator.\n\n*Bring Finder to the front.  \n\n*Hit  Cmd ⌘   N  for New Window, then  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   G  for Go To...  \n\n*Copy/paste ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Automator.savedState  \n\n*Delete the folder contents.\n\n", "Q: Finder sidebar icon for my folder I want to put a folder called, say, Fonts in the Finder sidebar. Normally, putting a folder there gives you a generic folder icon (see the Fonts folder below): \n\nHowever, I want to change the sidebar icon of the Finder folder to something like a stylized f. How would I do this?\nOne possible way would be to change the generic folder icon into the stylized f, but this would only really be viable if I wanted to put one folder there. Is there a better way?\n\nA: Not possible, at least without serious hacking.\nOS X supports changing folder and app icons through the \"get info\" pane (open \"get info,\" click the icon to select it and copy or paste). You can copy an icon from one app or folder and paste it onto another.\nHowever, when I tried this with a folder on my Mac, it did not affect the icon in the sidebar. It looks like the sidebar uses the type of the item to choose the icon, rather than using the icon in the info.\n", "Q: Output Macbook audio to iPhone or iPad This question is a duplicate, I know.\nDuplicate: Send audio output of MacBook to iPhone for remote listening\nHowever the age of this question and answer is about 5 years.

I am wondering how to connect LVDS cable from MBP to the controller board. Controller board already has it's own LVDS cable. I'm wondering if there is any kind of extension available that can be used to connect these two cables.

I would really like to not go through the procedure of temporarily removing display glass using hair dryer heat. Also I don't want to take display panel off the Apple casing that it comes in originally.\nThanks for the help in advance.\n\n\n\nA: IMHO I think it will be hard to make it work without disassembling the whole screen. The main reason for this is that the pinout of the connector coming out from the screen you attached in pic (whether 30 or 40 pins) is customised by Apple and may not correspond to the 30 (or 40) pins pinout of the connector soldered on the screen. For example, on some model I have seen that the producer puts display, camera and mic all together.\nEven thought you will be able to find an hypothetical female-female adapter, then, it is not 100% sure that will be pin correspondence. \nOne think you could do, if you want to proceed in finding an 1-1 adapter, is finding the schematics of the Apple LVSD cable that comes out of the screen and check for pin compatibility.If positive, then look for a female-female adapter.\nOr, in case you have money to spend into a new adapter (or build one yourself) have a look here<: http://dp2mbpr.rozsnyo.com/ or here https://hackaday.com/2013/07/05/macbook-pro-retina-display-with-a-normal-computer/\nCiao!\n", "Q: cron and \"command not found\" I'm setting up a cron job to run an executable bash script which contains a pypdfocr command.\nWhenever I manually execute the script everything works as expected, if instead I use cron with this schedule:\n* 6 * * * cd /path/to/ && ./executable\n\nI get this error:\npypdfocr: command not found\n\nGiven this, in the bash script I've tried to give the full path to pypdfocr, i.e.:\n/anaconda/bin/pypdfocr\n\nBut now I have:\n/bin/sh: pdfimages: command not found\n/bin/sh: gs: command not found\n\nAny idea on how I can fix this?\n\nA: When cron runs an event, it uses the default shell environment of the running UID. However, no \"profile\" customization is applied, i.e. your .bash_profile is not sourced and thus any PATH settings are not picked up. As well, I don't believe that the common profiles are picked up either. As such, you probably have no PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment settings available to the process you're trying to launch and this is why pdfimages and gs isn't being picked up by default.\nIn the past, I've solved this one of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Directly reference the full path of the file I need.\n\n*Create a wrapper shell script for the job.\n\n\nI typically prefer the 2nd one since it not only allows me to set up an environment for the job to run in, but it also makes it relatively easy to add debug situations easily. For example, if the job isn't working right I can just edit the shell script and put in STDOUT redirection to a debug file.\nSo in short, I would have a cron entry of\n* 6 * * * cd /path/to/ && ./executable.sh\n.. which would change to the path, but the executable.sh would do all the export PATH, export LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc. to get my job set up.\nYour sample executable.sh could be as simple as this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# if you want to just pick up your profile, you can '.' source it\n. ~/.bash_profile\n\nexport PATH=/where/i/find/gs\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/if/i/need/libs\n\n(./executable 2&>1) >executable.out\n\nThe executable.out file redirection isn't necessary since without it all STDOUT goes to cron.out, but it does make it a bit cleaner to do it this way. Also the 2>&1 nonsense with the parenthesis makes sure that both STDERR and STDOUT make it into the output file; this helps with debugging why a job didn't run.\n\nA: In the end I've followed the solution provided at How to use macports Python in a cron job?.\nI've checked my environment PATH by running env from Terminal, then I've exported it to my executable.\nexecutable:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin://anaconda/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin:/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/Users/USER/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/:/Users/USER/Library/Android/sdk/tools/:/usr/sbin/:/Users/USER/Tools/cpdf/OSX-Intel/\n# ...\n# REST OF SCRIPT\n# ...\n\nAfter this I've modified my cronfile with the following:\n* * * * * /path/to/executable\n\n", "Q: Font changes on Preview 2017 for text on photo I can find no answers to changing the font size on a photo in Preview.

I expect it to be periodically edited with the goal of becoming a comprehensive information resource.\nI have a MacBook Pro that has a key(Shift, Return, \n Command, P, etc.) that doesn’t respond when pressed or is stuck in the down position.  \nIt's possible that my favorite beverage was spilled (or some other liquid damage).  It's also possible that I have no idea what happened.  It was working yesterday and suddenly today it's no longer working.\nIs there any way to bypass or remap the key?  Can I  have the system ignore it completely?\n(This question can also apply to external USB keyboards or the Bluetooth keyboards)\n\nA: There are two scenarios which you will encounter:\n\n*\n\n*keys that don't respond when pressed\n\n*keys that are stuck; they act like they are being held down\n\nThe first case is potentially salvageable through the use of software to remap a key, or just changing your behavior when possible (i.e. use right Cmd  instead of left Cmd).\nThe second case, where the key is acting like it's pressed, the keyboard will likely have to be replaced because there is a physical connection being made and it's being sent to the logic board to be interpreted.\nKey not Responding\nIf a key isn’t responding it means that the electrical connection mapping the key is blocked.  Remapping keys can be done via 3rd party tools such as Karabiner or Karabiner Elements (Sierra and up).\nHowever, there's only so much remapping you can do and this isn't practical in the pre-boot stage (i.e. ⇧Shift keys or ⌥Option keys don't work).  This means if you need to go into Safe Mode (hold ⇧Shift, run Apple Hardware Test (hold D) or any other boot time key sequences, it won't work; you'll need an external USB keyboard.   You can remap once macOS has loaded, but not before.\nWith this scenario, you may be able to get around the unresponsive keys, but eventually you will have to replace it.\nKey is Stuck\nThe keyboard needs to be replaced.  There is a contaminant that is shorting electrical connections.  When you press a key, you are intentionally creating this short, but a liquid like water or soda (which can conduct electrical current) can bridge the connections closing the loop.  In these cases, they keyboard needs to be removed and cleaned with an electrical solvent.\nGiven the amount a labor to do this (there are a TON of screws – about 60 in total), it’s much more cost effective just to replace they keyboard with a new one.\nThe Butterfly Keyboard Issues\nThis applies to the 2016 through 2018 MacBook Pros and covers the gen 1, 2 and 3 keyboards.\nThe butterfly keyboard is a mechanical design change from the traditional keyboard mechanism.  The underlying electronic circuitry remains the same.\n\nThe \"shallower\" profile allows for less space requirements resulting in a thinner profile for the laptop.  However, a thinner profile means tighter operating tolerances. Contaminants and regular wear are now much more likely to contribute to premature failure resulting in either stuck or non-responsive keys.\nReplacing the Keyboard\nApple will traditionally replace your top case assembly. This is the aluminum housing that holds all the internals.\n\nNote:  For the Early 2015 through 2017 MacBook and 2016 through 2017 MacBook Pros, Apple has acknowledged the issue and is replacing the top case assembly through a Service Program.  However, they aren't replacing the gen 1 or gen 2 keyboards with the new gen 3 design.  Basically, they'll replace it with the same (flawed) model.  (IMO this puts owning an Apple MacBook/Pro on par with owning a Jaguar).\nTo replace this, you will have to remove the battery, fans, speakers, and logic board to swap the internals to the new assembly.  If you are going to go this far, just replace the keyboard and save yourself the money.\nReplacement MacBook Pro keyboards are relatively inexpensive (13\" MacBook Pro Keyboard and 15\" MacBook Pro Keyboard) versus a top case assembly - $25-$30 versus $250-$400.\niFixit.com has excellent guides to walk you through, but if you are unsure of your tech skills it's best to get a pro to do the job.\n\nHow a Keyboard Works\nTo understand all of this better, I \"dissected\" a (dead) MacBook Pro keyboard to better show how all of this comes together\nKeyboard Internals\nThe keyboard is made up of multiple layers:\n\n*\n\n*Keys (mechanical)\n\n*Plastic membrane\n\n*Circuit trace\n\n*Backplate\n\nLooking at the back of the keyboard (a dead donor from a 2009 MacBook Pro that had to be cut out due to a stripped screw) there is a black protective cover.  The only electrical contacts that can be seen is for the backlight and the keyboard connector interface\n\nRemoving the back cover, we can get a better look at the backplate.  This piece provides the stability and structure for the keyboard.\n\nLooking at the front of the keyboard with the keys removed, we can see through the plastic membrane layers all the way to the back plate (this portion is where the stripped screw was that had to be cut out)\n\nTaking an even closer look at the key, we can see how the mechanism attaches physically to the back plate to keep it in place.  The rubber cup is what provides the “spring” action to return the key to its unpressed position.\n\nPeeling back the layers we can see how it all comes together.  The plastic membrane with the rubber cups on top of the plastic membrane with the electrical traces on top of the metal back plate.\n\nCutting out a section of the trace membrane we can see how the electrical connections are made.  Looking closely, you can see that each key has a vertical connection with the key above/below it and a horizontal connection between the keys to the right/left.\n\nA keyboard works by completing the circuit between two circuits in a “grid” pattern.  This is how we can get 100+ keys with only 29 circuits.  For example, to get the letter “P” using the keyboard diagram below, it would create a closed circuit between Pin 1 (\"INT 5\") and Pin 8 (\"1Y1\").\n\nTL;DR - What this all means...\n\n*\n\n*Key(s) are stuck.  The circuit path is shorted.  This could be due to a foreign contaminant (including the key mechanism itself) putting pressure on the contact pad or some sort of FOD (foreign object debris) shorting out the circuit path.\n\n\n*Key(s) not responding.  The circuit path is broken.  When you press a key and nothing happens, no signal is being sent for the keyboard to recognize a key press.  This could be due to a short, bad contacts, a physically broken path, etc.\nA note on intermittent problems.  An intermittent electronic failure is a subset of the above conditions. Dry solder joints1, decayed glue2, and even bad/failed solid state components (i.e. resistors, capacitors, ICs, etc.)3; any/all of these can play a role in a circuit path failure.\n\n1 Dry joints are the main form of problem solder joint. These solder joints may be completely open circuit, or they may be intermittent, high resistance or noisy. It is therefore essential that no dry solder joints are present in any electronics equipment.

If it doesn't go to sleep, it's probably not connected.  Another good test is to run Apple Hardware Test (AHT).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.  If there is an issue with your sensor, it should show up in this test.\nYou will find the connector to the right of the battery terminal.

An archived Apple article says: \"Note: With an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault encryption when you start using your SSD drive.\"\nNow the question is what is standard erase and how do I perform it?\nIf it is the Erase button shown at the top of Disk Utility, then that button is greyed out and not clickable. If the Erase button is greyed out because the FileVault is currently turned ON, how do I go about deactivating it and doing a standard erase on my SSD? \nI just want to make sure that the data is non-recoverable before I give my Mac for repair.\n\nA: You can't perform an erase because you have booted from the SSD.  Hovering over the icon, will tell you why\n\nTo erase your SSD, boot from recovery or from a bootable USB then erase.  If you are sending it for repair, just create another admin account and delete your user profile.  It's much easier and just as secure.

My problem is that I can see the WordPress-based websites hosted on this web server externally, and on all the Windows machines on our LAN, but not on ANY of the Macs on our LAN. \nOne of our company's most important applications is based on being able to have one of the Macs query the webserver with http_get from time to time, and lately this query gets timedout or rejected also. \nPic of our LAN\n\nAll of the websites used to be view-able in Safari on the Macs, but sometime in the last few months they quit loading. The only really big change we've had is the installation of a new router (a Mikrotik that's a little tough to navigate). Here's what I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scanned the web server for malware and viruses, nothing bad reported, no website proxy changes, etc.\n\n*Removed all cookies, etc. from Safari and reloaded website, no luck\n\n*Installed Chrome to see if it was just a Safari problem, same errors but slightly different message (\"ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE\")\n\n*Checked to see that the router/DNS entries in networking settings of the Macs were configured well to the new Mikrotik (but again, not an expert on the Mikrotik end)\n\n*OS X Server Websites dashboard says that all websites are available on local network (green dashboard lights)\n\n*The webserver's default website (with the cute \"Welcome\" pic) IS accessible.\n\n*Checked the permissions on the website folders to ensure that _www permissions are good, etc. (again the WordPress websites work externally but not internally on just Mac machines, except for the OS X default website)\n\n*Checked apache access and error logs on the web server. Nothing showing up there - the attempt to access the website isn't even listed. \n\n\nMy guess is that there is something about the new Mikrotik router that is not allowing the Macs (based on how they're all configured) to see the locally hosted websites. But it could be a variety of other things too... I'd really appreciate any help.\n\n\nA: Doh! Okay, my bad for not including the gateway IP in the DNS listing as well as in the \"Router\" field on the Macs.

I am on an iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 10.3.3 and the Podcasts app (the default podcast app by Apple) does not continuously play unplayed podcasts that I've already downlaoded. It plays one at a time and every time I must manually click on the next one. Very annoying.\nIt's been like this for 6+ months now. I've restarted the phone, I've checked the moon button at the bottom of the screen to make sure it is marked as \"Off\". I also tried setting it to 1 hour and then back to Off...all to no avail. Curiously enough even after setting the moon button to one hour, and then scrolling to the end and letting it finish, it still does not even auto play the next unplayed podcast.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I have had the same issue since iOS 11 update. I can’t find a way to do this in the app other than constructing a playlist manually which is ridiculous. However, if you ask Siri to play unplayed podcasts, it will play them all continuously. Bit of a hack while waiting for Apple to fix. \n\nA: I found an answer here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8086917\nSummary - the \"All Unplayed\" part of the \"Library\" is a station like any other, and if you play the topmost podcast in the list it appears to also queue up the rest in \"up next\".  Not sure what happens at the end of that - whether new downloads will get added. \nThe \"Listen Now\" station does not act like this in my experience.\n\nA: I'm just going to answer with an alternative, since I've not used that app enough to know if it can do that.\nI use Downcast and I've not had a reason to use anything else. It can definitely do what you want. \nFor those who are interested, it also has a Mac app\nThe podcasts can be synced via iCloud.\nIn the iPhone, on the left side of the Play button there is a squiggly icon that is sort of like the infinity symbol with arrows, which will turn on continuous play. It's on when it's red.\nThe playlist creation is pretty nice too. By default the continuous play loops the current podcast's streamable episodes, but you can for example  make a playlist with all podcasts and listen to all of them continuously.\n\n", "Q: bash output inside the terminal : command not found Hi everyone,\nI wanted to ask a question about the bash output inside the terminal\nThe following procedure generates a command not found : \nTEST:~ SniperDMC$\nTEST:~ SniperDMC$ $HOSTNAME\n-bash: TEST.local: command not found\n\nHow to avoid this and beautify the output ?\nBest regards\nSniperDMC\n\nA: Well, $HOSTNAME is a variable, and if you just write it on a single line and press enter, bash will simply replace it with the respective value, i.e. \"TEST.local\". Since \"TEST.local\" is not a valid command, bash will complain. \nIf you want to print the value of any bash variable, you should use echo, i.e. echo $HOSTNAME. \nFor a quick bash scripting tutorial regarding variables, see here for example.\n", "Q: Office 2016 does not work with MathType: Migration of Word documents with MathType equations As you may already know, the combination of Microsoft Office 2016 and MathType does not work on macOS. Design Science announced support of that combination, but that was early 2016.\nI have lots of Word documents containing even more MathType equations. When I open such a document in Word 2016, I cannot edit the equations any more. Word complains about a missing server application when I double click on an equation.\nI am afraid that one time Office 2011 will not work any more. Also, I do not want to be stuck with it.\nIs there an option to migrate the documents to another application while preserving the alterability of the equations? Pages does not work. Is it possible to convert the documents to LaTeX?\n\nA: I just received this note from Mathtype, much more reassuring than I was expecting. In the meantime, I might try doing my word+mathtype work in Parallels.\nActually some versions of Office 2011 do work on High Sierra, but not if you continue to update to the latest version of Office 2011. Naturally updates are important for security reasons, so we don't recommend our customers stay with an early version of Office 2011 forever (I'm using 14.7.2, and it works fine).\nIt shouldn't be long though. We're hard at work on MathType 6.8 (which we think the version number will be) for Mac. We've been working together with Microsoft on this, and we have early betas now that we're using and testing within the company. It does integrate into Word 2016, with a MathType tab and commands on the tab similar to those on Word for Windows. We do have some things to work on, but our progress so far has been encouraging -- over the last couple of months anyway.\nYou may have read about our merger with Maths for More, the company behind the WIRIS equation editor (http://news.dessci.com/mathtype-and-wiris-join-forces). One result of the merger is that you will soon see more frequent releases of MathType (monthly is our goal), but our highest priority right now is releasing a version of MathType for Office 2016 on the Mac. The company isn't projecting a release date other than \"in coming months\". I'll be more specific than that and say I estimate it will be 8-12 more weeks. We're maintaining a list of customers who have asked about it, and those on the list will be among the first to know when we have news to report.\n", "Q: How are text messages (SMS) sent to an iPhone received in a Mac? I want to know the working of the program. When an SMS is sent to the iPhone, does it upload after receiving it on the phone to the iCloud, which then syncs it to the mac or does is it received directly by the mac independent of the phone?\nIn the first case, it would mean that the phone needs internet connection for the messages to be received on the Mac, whereas, in the second case, it would mean that messages are sent to Apple's server by the service provider. Or does it have any other mechanism? \n\nA: The setting \"Text Message Forwarding\" on your iPhone uploads/broadcasts all text messages to all verified devices through iCloud.\nYour iPhone needs data for this, obviously. Your carrier has nothing do to with this.\nAll devices need to be logged in to iCloud using the same Apple ID for this to work. Also, you need to verify each device as you enable them in your iPhone's settings.\nThis setting is part of Apple's Continuity feature set.\n", "Q: What more could I have done to secure my iPhone and iPad? I recently travelled to China for work. To my surprise our IT department confiscated my iPhone and iPad saying they could not secure the data or communications on my devices against prying eyes. \nWhen I complained saying I would leave them in Airplane mode and remove the SIM cards they said that wouldn't be enough to secure my data on these devices. Instead they gave me a mobile phone for the duration of the trip that was not a smartphone. It had no data connection per se, a physical numeric keypad, no touch screen or apps.\nI want to know why putting my devices in Airplane mode and removing the SIM cards is not enough to secure my data from prying eyes? The IT department wouldn't answer that question! \nI also want to know what else I could have done to secure the data on my iPhone and iPad, or is there no way to properly secure data on these devices? \nI go through phases of being rather paranoid, so that's the reason for wanting clarity on this. It's also one of the reasons I use Apple products, but this experience has got me spooked.\nBoth devices are running iOS 10.3.3.\n\nA: It really depends on what you're protecting, and what you're protecting it against. If you're worried about some phone thief grabbing your family photos, securing the devices is really easy. If you're worried about protecting classified info from the Chinese government, securing them adequately is really really hard.\nTurning on airplane mode and removing the SIMs will do a good job of securing them against network attack and/or snooping, but there's still the issue of someone getting physical and/or visual access to the device(s). There are some things you can do to harden them, mostly having to do with passcode security:\n\n*\n\n*Set a secure (complex) passcode. Without a passcode, your devices are open to anyone with physical access to them. With a basic (4-digit) passcode, you have reasonable protection. A 6-digit passcode is better, and a custom (longer) passcode (numeric or alpha) is even better.\n\n\n*Set the devices up to require that passcode. In Settings > Touch ID & Passcode, set it to require passcode immediately, erase data after 10 failed attempts (you should make a backup, but leave it at home), then switch off Voice Dial and all of the Allow Access When Locked options.\nI'd also turn off Touch ID. It avoids the possibility of someone spying on you entering your passcode, but if you're serious about security there's too many ways for someone to get & fake your fingerprint. Troy Hunt discusses some of the tradeoffs here.\n\n\n*Also, in Settings > Display & Brightness, turn on Auto-Lock after 1 minute.\n\n\n*Oh, and don't jailbreak your devices. If you've broken the iOS security model, don't expect it to remain intact against others.\nSo with the above (and turning off all network connections), your devices are pretty well locked down. But are they secure enough? As I said at the beginning, it really depends on the value of what you're protecting, the capabilities of whoever you're protecting it against, and how much they're willing to do to get your data. Can they compel to you to unlock the devices? Can they spy on you as you enter your passcode? Can they swap your devices for fakes that just capture the passcode you enter, and then use that to unlock the real devices? Can they confiscate the devices and then wait to see if a vulnerability is eventually discovered that'll let them unlock the devices? Is it possible they know of a non-public vulnerability? If the answer to any of those questions was \"yes\" (or even \"maybe\"), your devices aren't secure enough.\nBut there's another aspect to consider: from the point of view of your IT department, it may simply not be worth the trouble to work out the detailed risk & threat assessment, make sure they haven't forgotten any necessary steps to secure the devices (did I forget anything above? Maybe, maybe not), etc. From their point of view it's much easier and much safer to just say \"no, don't take them\".\n", "Q: Command-line stop MacBook from sleeping when lid is closed?

When I compare them with \ndiff /path/to/directory1/with/subdirectory/with/subdirectory/file_xyz /path/to/directory2/with/subdirectory/with/subdirectory/file_xyz\n\nor even \ndiff  /path/to/directory1/with/subdirectory/ /path/to/directory2/with/subdirectory/ \n\ndiff doesn't report any differences between these files or directories.\nWhat could be a reason why the \"large comparison\" reports so many differences (or seemingly fails), while the smaller chunk comparison doesn't?\n\nEdits since original post:\n\n\n*\n\n*The version of diff I'm using is GNU diffutils 2.8.1.\n\n*Just a wild guess here, but could it have something to do with the fact that these directories are on external hard drives that could experience some sort of timeout?\n\n*I ran another comparison and was again presented with lots of differences between those directories. I then set the system preference's Energy Saver to not set the display to sleep for 1 hour, because I had measured with time diff -r /path/to/directory1 /path/to/directory2 that it takes between 45 and 50 minutes for the diff to finish. My hard drives and the Mac never go to sleep.I then unmounted both drives and remounted them. Ran the diff again and voilà no differences found apart from one file. I manually compared that one reported differing file and found it to be identical.This seems to confirm what I found by comparing smaller chunks before. It also seems to confirm that there is something going on with a timeout as previously suspected, but I still wonder that if a FireWire drive would become unavailable or whatever, diff should not report a difference, but rather say \"file not available\" or \"Only in /yada/yada/directory: file_xyz\".Interestingly, the diff before the remount took 28 minutes, after the remount it took almost 51 minutes.In the light of that: What can I do to prevent something like that from happening?Of course one could say to never set the display to go to sleep or whatever, but that hardly seems to solve the underlying issue. Something else must be going on, I just can't figure out what.As an aside, on previous other occasions, after some time of inactivity on those FireWire hard drives I was trying to write to a file and got this *error code -50\" message (mind you I didn't see any of that during the diff operation). I could always \"resolve\" the issue by unmounting and remounting the drives, but I believe there must be an entirely different solution to that:Solutions like those presented here hardly seem to be tackling the underlying problem.\n\n\nA: For a week I've tested a recommended solution I found at iFixit, when someone encountered an error code -50 on an external HD. It seems to resolve the issue I had. I also came across error code -50 before when I tried copying files across, but didn't immediately link this to my issue of failing diffs. I had the suspicion that some inactivity on the external hard drives was responsible for the failure and the article seems to confirm that. To quote from there for the solution should you run into similar problems:\n\nTo work around this error you'll want to go into System Preferences->Energy Saver and for both Battery and Power Adapter tick the box next to \"Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible\" on your computer. Yes that means the OS will put all of your drives to sleep when it can but that's the only way I've found to fix the problem.\nWhat seems to happen is that some external drives have firmware which detects inactivity and spins the drives down. If OSX is not configured with the energy saver setting mentioned above then OSX is not expecting the drives to go to sleep. When accessing the drive after it puts itself to sleep obviously something gets messed up and the error -50 is thrown among other problems.\nBy configuring the OS to put disks to sleep the OS will issue spin-up commands.\n\nThe one thing that puzzles or surprises me though is why diff would report actual differences in files, when in fact it couldn't access(?) the file properly.\n", "Q: How to reliably restore photos on iPhone 4S? I've been asked to help restore photos and videos from an iPhone 4S, after a reset. No iCloud backup. I see a lot of software that claims it can do this, and paying a fee is just fine.

The video files are of lower priority. \nWhat have all of you done to recover lost data on iPhones? \nThanks!\n\nA: iPhones are hardware encrypted. \nIf you reset the phone from scratch, everything that was on there before is gone.\n Once the hardware key is erased, the data is not recoverable by any means. \nThat's what backups are for.... iExplorer et al can scour backups & the current phone system... but not encrypted, overwritten devices. \n", "Q: Is the iPhone 8 Plus case compatible with iPhone 7 Plus I am wondering if the new iPhone 8 Plus is case compatible with the iPhone 7 Plus, meaning that I can buy an iPhone 7 Plus case today and would be able to use with my new iPhone 8 Plus once I receive it?\nThe reason for my question is that I cannot find the physical dimension of these models on apple.com. \n\nA: Actually, it seems that the iPhone 8 Plus is case compatible to the iPhone 7 Plus. I was checking the one of the iPhone 7 Plus cases and on apple.com. It stated that it is good for both of these models.\nAlso there is the phone comparison page on apple.com where the dimensions are listed. \n", "Q: Why is iOS unable to find my apps? Since updating to iOS 11, search is unable to find my apps. Is this a new feature of iOS 11; a bug; or something that will eventually resolve itself over time?\nI have so many apps that the only practical way to find them is to search for them, and in the past this has worked perfectly. E.g. simply typing \"stack\" (in fact just \"st\") suggests several apps including the one I'm looking for, 'Stack Exchange' listed right at the top of the screen.\nNow however I get a very different result:\n\nA bunch of useless search results at the top, and a suggestion from the app store for an app I'd never want. No sign of the frequently used app sitting right on my device.\nWhat's going on here. Is there anything (short of restoring iOS 10) that I can do do address this?\n\nJudging from the behavior I'm seeing I wonder if Apple hasn't changed the meaning of the Siri setting for apps from meaning \"search in the app\" to \"search for the app\": the only apps I see at all are ones where this setting is enabled. Is that perhaps what's happened (or does having this on just get those apps indexed first)?\n\nA: If you are unable to search for apps you could once find, check your settings to see what apps you prevented Search from searching within.\nApple recently changed the behavior of the relevant setting (Siri & Search). Prior to iOS 11 disabling this setting for an app prevented Search from showing results from \"inside\" the app (e.g. Dropbox listing files). With iOS 11 this behavior has changed: now this setting must be enabled for the app itself to appear in Search results at all.\n\nNote that while this appeared to have been \"fixed\" in the betas of 11.2 with a new explicit option, \"Show App\" to search for the app, this seems to have been released (in 11.2.1) as \"Suggestions in Look Up\" which doesn't achieve the same result.\n\nA: Today I decided to give iOS 11.2 beta 4 a try. Though I hadn't read about this specific change, I was thrilled to see that Apple has addressed this issue! There is now a separate 'Show App' setting available on a per-app basis. It's still going to be tedious to go in to each of my 300-or-so apps to enable this, but I'm glad there's a way to again use Spotlight to launch apps.\n\nMy version of this question: Fixing app search in iOS 11\n\nA: Here is the solution; you need to manually turn on search results (“Search and Siri Suggestions”) for each individual app under Siri & Search settings. Once you do this it will work immediately, no need to index or plug your phone in - back to normal! \nIt was frustrating but when I went through the list I realized there were actually many apps that I was happy to exclude from search so that I can find the important apps even faster. Good luck! \n\nA: I don't think any of these solutions address the real problem. I'm having the same issue but I realized that you need to spell the exact name of the application you are looking for (Which is really annoying).\nSo in your case, you would have to search for \"stack exchange\". I hope Apple fixes this soon. They may have \"Improved\" functionality but they've broken simple app searches.\n\nA: For iOS 11.2.1, go to Settings | Siri & Search then turn off Suggestions in Search.  \n\nNow the top hit is an app and the first block of results is also apps:\n\n\nA: The indexing (and over resource dependent calculations as image scanning) is only done when connected to a power source, as far as I know.

I'm trying to disable thumbnail loading in Finder for all folders, since every time I open a folder of PDFs it takes about 2 seconds to load, which I find slow. This seems to happen every time even when I open the same folder, so it appears the Thumbnails are not getting cached.\nI went into view options, disabled the thumbnail loading, and clicked \"use as defaults\". However, it didn't actually apply to all folders. When I go into a different folder, I have to make the setting changes I just made again. If I'm not mistaken, this seems to defeat the entire purpose of a \"use as defaults\" feature, because I'm assuming that's supposed to apply to all folders, so you don't have to painstakingly go to each individual folder and change the settings.\nI have the same problem as in this thread by someone else from 2014. The solution in that thread was to make the settings in the top-level folders on the finder sidebar (Documents, Download, etc.) and then clicking \"use as defaults\", after which the subfolders are supposed to automatically be set. I did this, and the subfolders were not set.\nAnyone have a solution?\n\nA: You should not do this with a folder in the sidebar: that is only an alias.\nDo the same with a folder in the Homefolder and it works:\ncheck the most above views: always open in icon view and browse in icon view\n", "Q: iCloud Photo Sharing doesn't work on my iPhone in iOS 11 I just sign out and sign in again to my iCloud account on iPhone but there is no shared albums at all.

Usually I can reboot and it will start to work again.  This time a reboot did not fix it.\nI contacted VMWare and they declined support because they claim it does not work and it never worked.  They sent me this link supposedly supporting that, but by my reading it does not support their claim:\nhttps://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1032440\nI am quite sure that I use drag and drop between the guest and host previously as it is part of my development workflow.\nFurther supporting my claim that it previously worked I previously submitted a ticket about it not working, but by the time the support person got back to me I had to reboot and no longer had a test case for them to work on.  They then suspended the ticket.\nIf someone could run a quick video of drag and drop working on they similar setup I would appreciated getting a copy so I could send it to VMWare to get them to take my issue seriously.\nWhat can I try to get drag and drop to work again?\n[EDIT] I updated the guest machine to 10.12.6 and drag and drop started to work again.  Problem solved except I want to get to the bottom of it to keep it from happening in the future.\nI just got this email from VMware claiming that this feature does not work:\n\n** Please do not change the subject line of this email if you wish to respond. **\nHello Michael,\nThank you for your response.\nThis feature is not supported. Kindly refer the knowledge base article\n  which lists the limitations for VMware Fusion 8.5.8 and also for the\n  latest Fusion 10.\nThe feature may have worked in the earlier builds or may work\n  intermittently with the newer version. However, we have checked with\n  the engineering team and they have confirmed that we do not support\n  the drag and drop feature.\nThese were the inputs which were shared directly from the engineering\n  team: For MacOS guest, Drag & Drop/Copy & Paste file is not supported,\n  it only supports copy text between guest and host. Like copy a string\n  in TextEdit from guest and paste it to host's TextEdit. \nSo, it's not a bug\nWe request you to submit a feature request.\n\n\nA: I found out today that it does work with VMware Fusion 10.1.2 and VMware Tools 10.2.5 on Mac OS X 10.11.6 El Capitan but it doesn't work for me on macOS 10.13.4. \nProbably this has something to do with User Authorized Kernel Extension Loading (UAKEL). If your Mac is managed by an MDM, kernel extensions are managed by User Approved MDM Enrollment (UAMDM) a management profile. \nAs far as I understand how Drag and Drop works, it used some kind of filesystem driver. Maybe this used to use a (third party?) kernel extension which is no longer trusted? \nFurther Readings:\nUAKEL: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2459/_index.html\nUAMDM: https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2018/04/12/whitelisting-third-party-kernel-extensions-using-profiles/?_sm_byp=iVV4WQj4MknqbVsJ\n\nA: Drag and drop was supported as can be seen in this YouTube tutorial at 08:36 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR28kVtZYJY \n", "Q: How to prevent people from adding other people in an iMessage group?

Thinking this might be the cause I removed it from Profiles.\nHow can I update, or how can I troubleshoot the situation?\n\nA: Try iTunes to update your iPad Pro to latest iOS 11 first. If iTunes doesn't prompt you there is a new version to update, then you will have to use software which will install iOS 11 onto your iPad Pro.\n\nA: One thing that happens every release is that Apple rolls out the new os in stages. If you imagine Apple has one thousand update servers, it starts with a few and then rolls out the catalog of available updates to more and more servers. \nAnecdotally, it’s rare for an update check to not see the update within 24 hours in the US but I certainly have seen some cases where a non-major update (say 10.2.1 to 10.2.2) didn’t fully propagate or be offered for almost 4 days after “release” that eventually was offered. \nIf you need an update, using iTunes to force it is one option of your over the air server isn’t ready to provide the update you expect. Before resorting to iTunes or just waiting, I would also reboot your device once or twice in case it’s just some corruption on the running os and also free up 4 GB of storage if you might be running low on space to hold the download and data that needs to migrate during the upgrade. \n", "Q: is my iphone spying on my macbook?

Is it possible this is malware?\n\nA: it is normal.your devices won't actually use this e.g. for bt file exchange but when using services/features like continuity/handoff etc you will see they are somehow connected (transferring data).if both of your devices have the same iCloud account, then this is it.no need to worry.\n", "Q: Command Line FTP Client Confused By Tilde? I noticed this really weird behaviour in the macOS command line ftp client...\nget index.html ~/Desktop/index.html\n\nfails if there exists no 'index.html' on the Desktop with the error\nftp: Can't access `~/Desktop/index.html': No such file or directory\n\nbut\nget index.html /Users/fweth/Desktop/index.html\n\nsucceeds!  Afterwards, I can also use the first command to update the local file.  Can anyone explain this to me?\n\nA: What you are seeing is expected behavior.\nThe tilde (~) is a part of the shell's standard syntax that is synonymous with the user's home directory.\n\nTilde expansion is the process of converting these abbreviations to\nthe directory names that they stand for.\n\nWhen you are in FTP, you are not using your shell (bash, csh, zsh, etc.), rather you are using the FTP client and it has no idea what the tilde means and thusly, it cannot expand it out.\n~ and HOME are the same thing.  If you execute the command\n$ echo ~ $HOME\n\nYou should get your home directory output twice.

I actually have a long list of items I would like to customize every time I create a new user on mac, and I'm not sure where to find the reference for each (ie in order to change them programmatically)\nI have macos sierra version 10.12.6\nthe list includes:\n\n\n*\n\n*making the mouse not scroll naturally \n\n*make the doc automatically hide \n\n*set the min/max value of the app icons to certain values as depicted here:\n\n\n*remove all the default app icons form the doc as depicted here\n\n\n*how two remove the ⌘Space shortcut for spotlight search as depicted here:\n\n\n*etc\nQuestion\nCan someone please show me where I can find an official reference online where I can find out where I can program such things? \n\nA: If you're wanting to use AppleScript to automate changing a set of system preferences, then the AppleScript Language Guide is where to start learning how to use AppleScript.\nAs far as \"a reference list of scriptable configuration items\" you mentioned in your comments, to my knowledge, there is no unified reference list of items in System Preferences that can be configured using AppleScript UI Scripting. The list, per se, is right in front of you, it's the entire System Preferences UI itself and the querying of the UI via System Events and UI elements to get the object properties and their hierarchy.\nExamples:\ntell application \"System Events\" to get every UI element of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\ntell application \"System Events\" to get properties of every UI element of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\ntell application \"System Events\" to get every UI element of scroll area 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\ntell application \"System Events\" to get properties of every UI element of scroll area 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n\nIf you have Xcode installed, you can use Accessibility Inspector to get information about the UI elements and their hierarchy.\nAny application process that has its has scripting terminology property set to true should have an AppleScript Dictionary that you can open from Script Editor > Window > Library and then peruse to see what's available to directly script with that given application.\nWith a given app running if you run the following command in Script Editor, e.g.\ntell application \"System Events\" to get has scripting terminology of process \"System Preferences\"\n\nIt returns true, however in the case of \"System Preferences\" there is a small set of commands you can use directly with it, however to make some of the setting changes you mention in your OP, using AppleScript, you need to use UI Scripting. \nAs you can see by the example AppleScript code below, it in most part uses UI Scripting but does so without having to have the System Preferences UI visible. The primary issue with UI Scripting can be adding appropriate delay commands as needed in some places. This come with experience but also with necessity when you run a script, e.g. in Script Editor, and it errors out. Inserting the delay and appropriate value for it becomes second nature with time at programming UI Scripting.\nHere is some example AppleScript code, you might find useful to help achieve your goal of automating setting for a new user.\nNote that while this worked on my system running macOS 10.12.5 as is and without issue, YMMY and some adjustments may need to be made and or additional error handling, etc.\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    if running then\n        quit\n        delay 0.5\n    end if\n\n    --  # General\n\n    reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.general\"\n    delay 0.5\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        --  # Automatically hide and show the menu bar\n        click checkbox 4 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n    end tell\n\n    --  # Dock\n\n    reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.dock\"\n    delay 0.5\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        --  # Size (Valid values, 0.0 to 1.0)\n        set value of value indicator 1 of slider 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\" to 0.25\n        --  #   Magnification\n        if value of checkbox \"Magnification:\" of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\" is equal to 0 then\n            click checkbox \"Magnification:\" of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n        end if\n        --  # Min Max (Valid values, 0.0 to 1.0)\n        set value of value indicator 1 of slider 2 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\" to 1.0\n        --  # Automatically hide and show the Dock\n        click checkbox 2 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n    end tell\n\n    tell current application\n\n        --  # Backup the original com.apple.dock.plist file before removing all default apps from the Dock.\n\n        do shell script \"cp -a $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.ORIGINAL.plist\"\n\n        --  # Remove all default apps from the Dock.

I booted in Windows 7 and now cannot boot back in MacOSX as the BootCamp Utility on Windows isn’t working properly. I’ve tried using the Cmd and Option key combinations to launch in Boot Selector or Recovery Mod, but neither of them work as it seams that the keyboard isn’t being detected until Windows launches. I’ve also tried removing the HDD that Windows is installed on, but that only brings a black screen with a single flashing underscore in the top left corner.\nNeed urgent support to get back into MacOSX to access my Business Critical applications.\n\nA: Try something for me, if it doesn't work, ask someone else.\nRestart the computer.

That's how I had to switch between windows and MacOSX on my mac.  \n", "Q: Can I upgrade a previously purchased iPhone under the iPhone Upgrade Program? I bought an iPhone 6s Plus from Apple a couple of years ago. Can I enroll in the iPhone Upgrade Program and upgrade it to an iPhone 8/X?\n\nA: Apple offers trade in for any phone you own outright. You have to pay monthly as part of an upgrade plan to get started, so unless you are paying Apple or the financing arranged through apple, you aren't part of the upgrade program which lets you get a new phone after 12 monthly payments.\nYou can easily check though - https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program\nI suppose it depends on what you mean by \"upgrade\" and what exact transaction you started a couple of years ago.\n", "Q: Where is the Mac password requested by iOS stored? Recently (newly with iOS 11 for me, but apparently earlier for others) my iPhone has asked for my Mac password, indicating that until I provide it, certain features (on iOS?) will be unavailable to me.\nIs this stored somewhere once requested. If so where is this password stored?\n\nA: With public key cryptography, It's not necessary to store any password on a technical level.\nApple could implement a “use once locally and securely destroy immediately” algorithm as part of key procurement (to decrypt keys used for encrypting data marked as 'secure' on iCloud such as Health, where the keys are based in part on device password) to derive cryptographic keys have been generated based on your current device passcode, apple keys, or other factors.\n", "Q: Show hidden files files in Finder except .DS_Store I configured my Mac to show hidden files by setting AppleShowAllFiles to true running this bash command:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool YES; killall -HUP Finder\n\nThat solved my previous problem. However, there's a file that does not matter to me and I want it to be hidden again, .DS_Store.\nI still want to see the other hidden files, except .DS_Store. Is there a way?\nI am using OS X 10.11. \n\nA: One way to achieve your desired results is to upgrade to Sierra.\nmacOS 10.12 shows all hidden files via your command\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool YES\n – but Finder has been taught a 'new trick': it will never show you .DS_Store files regardless of your wishes or instructions.\nThis has the side effect that your Trash will be almost always be displayed as full, even when it is 'empty' as per Finder inspection. Because the .DS_Store file for Trash will trigger the 'full' Trash icon.\n\nA: No, there is no way to fine-tune which files are visible with AppleShowAllFiles in Finder.\n\nA: If you are using macOS 10.8 - 10.10 you can try Asepsis.\nIt prevents creation of .DS_Store files by redirecting their creation into a special folder.\n", "Q: How do I make my Apple earphone's play button not launch iTunes and instead pause/play a video on YouTube? What the title says. I already have BeardedSpice for my media keys, but I wanted to know if there was a way to make the earbuds' play button not launch iTunes every time I press it.\n\nA: Taken from here: The short answer is that you can't select which media app has priority since they're all equally treated, but if there's nothing playing iTunes takes preference.\nThe linked answer also pointed to a patch for the Remote Control Daemon at https://github.com/thebitguru/play-button-itunes-patch, which might be what you were looking for. It's a 1 MB download and you will need at least El Capitan (OS 10.11). On that page it says:\n\nThis is a patch for removing the default OS X behavior of always starting iTunes when the play button on the keyboard is pressed. This feature can be useful for a lot of users, but it can also be annoying if you are using VLC, Nightingale or other similar programs that support the media keys.\nThe application will patch the Remote Control Daemon to prevent it from starting iTunes whenever you press the play button on the keyboard or an external remote control. This will only prevent iTunes from starting, all other functions (like play/pause while iTunes is running) will continue to work as before. The original file is backed up in case you would like to restore the original functionality.\n\nIt's unfortunately not a straight forward installation.

Now I cannot get it to install correctly. Please note: this is not a development question but an installation of software question.\nThere are many discussions of similar issues, but none exactly what I am seeing.\nA short answer to my question would be \"it is no longer possible to run CommandLineTools unless full Xcode is installed\". I am hoping that is not the case.\nI have tried many variations on all the suggested steps, along with attempts at clean uninstallation and starting over. I have gleaned a lot of steps from the following sources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/\n\n*http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html\n\n*https://macpaw.com/how-to/uninstall-xcode-on-macos\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27438457/xcode-6-1-how-to-uninstall-command-line-tools\nAnd likely more pages that I did not record.\nI have installed Xcode, uninstalled it, installed and uninstalled standalone CommandLineTools, used xcode-select --switch, and more, all in various combinations.\nThe result is that when full Xcode is not installed, when trying to run a command, I get the following error message or similar, depending upon the command:\n\nxcode-select: error: tool 'opendiff' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance\n\nWith full Xcode, the commands work.\nIn many places in the threads mentioned above, people complain about having to have 6GB of unwanted code; this is no longer incorrect. The current version of Xcode is now 10GB.\nMy main use of the CommandLineTools is to support MacPorts. As a bonus I like opendiff in some cases where my main tools are farther out of reach.\nIs there a solution to this issue?\nEDIT: I see that Apple now provides a direct way of installed Command Lines Tools only as Command_Line_Tools_macOS_10.13_for_Xcode_9.4, but it is only for High Sierra. While I am still a hold out to the upgrade to HS, it will be only a very short time before I do this upgrade. Hoping that is the line of least resistance.\n\nA: Maybe things have changed since this question was originally asked but I had no trouble downloading command-line tools from here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/download/more/\n(I did this after deleting XCode to save about 13 GB of disk space).\n\n\nA: I don't think there's a solution since opendiff calls the GUI program FileMerge which ships with Xcode.\nYou would want to use another diff tool - perhaps the gnu tools from homebrew or my favorite paid diff tool that has a command line tool - ksdiff from Kaleidoscope.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://kaleidoscopeapp.com\nIt's a powerhouse of GUI diff goodness for when the command line options don't cut through the task you need done.\n\nA: You can try solution from here: Github script to install tools from Xcode 3.2.6\nI used this to have FileMerge.app without Xcode and works even on High Sierra.\n\nA: I spend over 3 hours fixing problem with osx 10.14\n$ sudo -s\n$ touch /tmp/.com.apple.dt.CommandLineTools.installondemand.in-progress;\nPROD=$(softwareupdate -l |\n  grep \"\\*.*Command Line\" |\n  head -n 1 | awk -F\"*\" '{print $2}' |\n  sed -e 's/^ *//' |\n  tr -d '\\n')\nsoftwareupdate -i \"$PROD\" --verbose;\n\n", "Q: What is WoWEnabled?

I decided to use Disk Utility to create a container for it (otherwise Google Drive would have to create many files and directories taking up a huge amount of the time). \nI noticed that Disk Utility creates a read-only DMG file by first creating a sparseimage, then converting it to a DMG file. \nAs a result, to cut down on time, I am wondering if creating sparseimages of my files, then uploading to Google Drive is better than putting it into a DMG file. My two main concerns are:\n1) I read somewhere that sparseimages seem to have a greater than of being corrupt on Google Drive or cloud services?\n2) Is there any real difference between the two beyond write/read-only capabilities?\n\nA: From Wikipedia:\n\nA sparse image is a type of disk image file used on macOS that grows in size as the user adds data to the image, taking up only as much disk space as stored in it. Encrypted sparse image files are used to secure a user's home directory by the FileVault feature in Mac OS X Snow Leopard and earlier. Sparse images can be created using Disk Utility.\nUnlike a full image file (.dmg), which takes up as much actual space as the real disk it represents (regardless of the amount of unused space), a sparse image file (.sparseimage) takes up only as much actual disk space as the data contained within, up to a maximum of the capacity assigned during creating.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_image\nIn your case, because you don't indicate you plan to use the utility of the sparseimage mechanism in any way to create an expansible, or 'live' storage container, creating .dmg files would be called for because they are monolithic files best use for archiving.\nIf the data is already indexed or organized in some way, then creating separate .dmg files make a logical container to extend and reinforce that organization. Ex: TaxDocuments2010.dmg, TaxDocuments2011.dmg,  etc.\nGoogle has a max size of 5TB per single non-Google document file, BTW.\nLastly, you may wish to package this data in a non-Apple proprietary format such as tar or GZIP so it can be opened on other platforms. \n", "Q: MBP 13\" Early 2011 Thunderbolt Firmware Version - How to update 22.1 to latest version I bought a Kanex KTU10 to add USB 3.0 support on my machine because its only on USB 2.0.

Till iOS 10.3, control center did not allow you to toggle mobile data from control center. Thus, if your phone was being handled by someone else, he could not switch off mobile data without locking the phone. \nHowever, with iOS 11, mobile data switch has been added to the control center and now anyone handling my iPhone with iOS 11 can switch off mobile data. This also compromises Find my iPhone feature in a big way. \nHow do I prevent somone from switching off mobile data from control center?\n\nA: Do not worry, it is still possible.The way is a little long. Just follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Restrictions\n\n*If you have setup Restrictions, enter your Restrictions passcode. If you have not set it up yet, enter a password (twice) and enable Restrictions. Make sure you will never forget this passcode; it is required even when resetting the phone.

NVRAM Reset Didn't Work So I just finished my 4,1–5,1 build. I installed a pair of X5675's along with two sticks of Samsung 16GB DDR3,4RX4 PC3-10600R 1333MHz 240-pin ECC REG Server Ram, for 32Gb. Trouble is, it's showing up as 1066 instead of 1333.\nNow, the machine is running fine, but I'm curious as to why my memory isn't showing full speed–I triple checked the specs on that RAM before I bought it and thought it should work, and it does, but not at 1333. Tried zapping the NVRAM, to no avail. Anyone have any ideas?\n\nA: I can't find out what actually decides it, however I just noticed this note on the Apple KB - Mac Pro (Mid 2012 and earlier): How to remove or install memory\n\nNote:   Although the memory speed of the UDIMMS is 1333 MHz, they will\n  operate at 1066 MHz or 1333 MHz depending on the processor in the\n  computer.\n\nTypically, MacPro5,1 models with one of the Nehalem processors only support a memory speed of 1066 MHz, while those with one of the Westmere processors support a memory speed of 1333 MHz. In your case, the X5675 processors are one of the Westmere variety, so I can't explain the discrepancy in speed.\nI have a pair of X5690 in mine & RAM runs at 1333MHz.\nIt's probably worth making sure you have the pair in the correct places, just in case...\n\nBTW, the Pros run fastest in triple channel - so if you can afford one more RAM stick...\n\nA: It is known that 4rx4 modules does not work properly on Mac Pro, and when they work they do at 1066Mhz.\nThe recommended modules are 2Rx4, in fact, they are faster on terms of latency\n", "Q: What does that mean of PgIn[ST3P], RdMeta[ST3UP] when use fs_usage in osx When i use \"sudo fs_usage -w -f diskio\" in terminal to show disk call status, the call column show something like this: PgIn[ST3P], PgIn[AT3UP], PgIn[S], PgIn[AT1], WrMeta[A], PgIn[AT3U], RdData[ANT3U], RdMeta[ST2], RdMeta[ST3UP], WrData[AT1], ...\nWhat does that mean?\n\nA: From the fs_usage man page:\n\nCALL  The name of the network or filesystem related call, page-in, page-out, or physical disk access.\n\nPgIn and PgOut are page-in and page-out.\nRdMeta and WrMeta are reading and writing file metadata.\nRdData and WrData are reading and writing to the file.\n", "Q: Will the quality of my JPEG images taken by my iPhone deteriorate if I rotate than on my Mac? Can I safely rotate JPEG images on my MacBook or would this be lossy?\n\nA: Using Preview.app, the rotation applied is not lossless. You need to use a special tool that will either add an EXIF rotation header (which is then applied only on display) or simply keeps the encoding coefficients constant, but shifts them accordingly. One tool that supports this that has a UI is Xee, on the commandline you could use jpegtran or imagemagick.\n\nA: I would of thought that any differences would be negligible however:\nCreate a copy of your picture then rotate that, compare file sizes / image quality after. \nJPEG is already a lossy compression format in either case. \n", "Q: Would App store accept a program that bundles a Python interpreter?

Yesterday I was working on a project in Adobe illustrator, that project had various white spaces it was then when I noticed a black spot/smudge in the lower corner of the display of my iMac. I thought it must be a dust particle on the outer glass screen of the iMac so I used a microfibre cloth to remove it which eventually failed cause it was then when I realised there is huge black smudge in the actual display of the iMac which is inside the outer glass screen\n\nA: Gotcha! the black spot is actually dead pixels. I had an Apple Engineer to diagnose the display who said this is an obvious thing to happen and it doesn't happens because of daily usage. So I asked him why does this happens, he said that Apple has the tendency to reuse old and thrown out refurbished, recycled displays which is why sometimes these displays fitted into a brand new $1000 iMac shows these black spots/smudges specially in areas where the speakers are located!\n", "Q: Convert a plain disk \"legacy image\" so that it can be mounted I have a plain disk image, created from using dd.

I'm reading that the users will see the 1.0 (App Store version) as an update available but will they have to pay for it or will they just keep the app and future updates for free?\n\nA: I've had mixed experiences with whether users see the app show in Updates at all in the App Store. Generally it's safer to suggest that users will have to navigate through the App Store and search for your app to find 1.0. This is in line with what Apple says:\n\nWhen the test period is over, you will no longer be able to open the beta build. To install the public version of the app, download or purchase the app from the App Store.

But I could probably do with updating again — to Sierra — as certain programs require a more recent OS than what I have.\nI am a bit concerned that running Sierra will put too much of a strain on my machine... or are the requirements not a whole lot different to any other versions of OS X over the last 5 years or so?\n\nA: Here are the general requirements as specified by Apple:\nOS X Yosemite\n\nOS X Yosemite - Technical Specifications\nGeneral Requirements OS X\nv10.6.8 or later\n2GB of memory\n8GB of available storage\nSome features require an Apple ID; terms apply.\nSome features require a compatible\nInternet service provider; fees may apply.\n\nmacOS Sierra\n\nMacOS Sierra - Technical Specifications\nGeneral Requirements\nOS X 10.7.5 or later\n2GB of memory\n8.8GB of available storage\nSome features require an Apple ID; terms apply.\nSome features require a compatible Internet service provider; fees may apply.\n\n", "Q: Copying and pasting text only pastes a hyphen character When I copy a block of text more than about twenty lines long to the clipboard, pasting only pastes a hyphen character.\nWhy is the clipboard buffer so small and how can I increase it?\n\nA: You should not hit the clipboard buffer limit in normal use, it is far bigger than a “block of text”. Depending on where you copy from, the source application might be transforming the buffer before storing it. Especially some websites have scripts for these kinds of interceptions in an attempt to prevent large-scale copying of copyrighted information – in these cases you can often work around using the Edit > Copy menu item instead of the Cmd-C shortcut, for example. Other applications might change the clipboard format after reaching a certain size, and might then have a bug when generating e.g. a Rich Text buffer versus a Plain Text buffer. Another thing you could try is pasting with the Paste and Match Style option, by choosing it from the Edit menu or pressing Ctrl-Shift-Cmd-V.\n", "Q: Testflight or coupon codes for review websites We will soon be launching the first version of our app. We want to write to a lot of app review websites about our app and want to give a free test version to them.

Is it allowed to just give review websites a TestFlight version or is there some rule or limitations to who you can add as external tester (for a paid app)? \n\nA: There's no rules on iTunes Connect help to say who you can give TestFlight access to.\nGiving access to TestFlight to reviewers might be an advantage, besides the promotional code limit, as the app doesn't need to be live for reviewing to take place (or the review can be of a new, unreleased app version).\n", "Q: How to quickly screenshot all apps in all screens & folders? I have an iPhone 6 running iOS 11.  I need to wipe it out and reinstall iOS like it's a new iPhone (not restoring from a backup).  \nWhen I've done this in the past, I've taken screenshots of all my screens so I'd know where I had each app & folder laid-out (I spent a lot of time laying-out the apps just the way I like them).  After I wiped the iPhone I'd go download all the apps again and lay them out in their folders just like they were before, referencing the old screenshots.   I have 4 screens of folders and apps so it's not a trivial exercise.  As you can imagine, this took a lot of time.\nI'm trying to find a better, faster way to capture where I have every folder, their contents (multiple pages), and every app placed throughout all my screens.    \nI don't want to jailbreak just to get this ability.  Is anyone aware of an app that can do this?   I'll even accept a way to connect the iPhone to my MBP and run a script or something on the Mac to get the screenshots.  In fact, I'll even take a text representation of the screen/folder/app hierarchy, if necessary.\n\nA: This is a bit of a stretch but might work.\nI have heard that if you plug your iPhone into your Mac and start Quicktime Player there is an option (possibly under the file menu) to capture what is appearing on the screen of the phone. \nIf that does (still?) work then doing that would allow you to go through the whole iPhone's UI as fast as you like recording everything as you go in one Quicktime movie that you can save on your Mac and pause as needed as a reference to how it was set up before.\nNote I haven't tried this myself but it sounds like it should work...\n\nA: I've already accepted an answer on my question but I wanted to add some new info that I've found to allow users of iOS 11 to record your iPhone/iPad screen (building on the answer provided by @steve-chambers.\nBeginning in iOS 11, you can add Screen Recording to the Control Center.  This will allow you to record all your screens, the layout of your apps, and then go into each folder to record the app positions there.\nGo to Settings -> Control Center -> Customize Controls.  From there, add the Screen Recording control from More Controls into Include.\nNow, you can start the screen recording from Control Center instead of connecting to your computer and, if on a Mac, using QuickTime to do the recording.\nOnce again, all props to @steve-chambers for suggesting the screen recording idea.

All other sound is played trough the default sound device EXCEPT flash player sound.\nRestarting firefox doesn't help.\nReinstalling the flash player plugin doesn't help.\n\nTo which the answer says:\n\nYeah, this is a lingering Firefox problem, and it's related to limitations in how we had to retrofit sandboxing to the NPAPI.  The best workaround is probably to just use Chrome.  I forget the exact reason why (this has been a problem for years) but the low-integrity Flash Player process doesn't have permission to call into the Windows Sound APIs necessary to set the correct output target, and I don't believe that we can broker it safely for some reason.\nMozilla has recently engaged in a collaborative effort with us to improve the overall experience with Flash in Firefox by addressing some of these long-standing architectural deficiencies.  Our hope is that we'll be able to provide both a secure and efficient Flash implementation all around, but that effort is going to take at least several months before it reaches customers (and we're doing incremental stuff in the meantime).\nSorry I don't have better news on that front.\n\nThe Q&A is a good two years old, I'm hoping there has been some improvements by now.\nAny fixes?\n\nA: The solution I've found is to use the HTML5 Video Player.\nFlash can be blocked or turned off in \"manage plug-in use\" - the grey looking lego-type piece with a blue dot at its top right - next to the url:\n\nwhich, if flash is on, will bring up something like this:\n\nat which point you can block it.\nUpon restarting Firefox it will stop trying to use Flash automatically and default to the HTML5 Video Player. The HTML5 Video Player in Firefox has no problem passing audio through HDMI.\nNot all flash based videos - or services - can also use the HTML5 Video Player, but for those that can this is a great solution.\n\nA: In my experience, changing the available audio outputs on macOS does not always propagate properly to all running applications and processes. First, make sure you have selected the HDMI audio output, for example by Option-clicking on the speaker symbol in the status bar. If it still doesn’t work, try restarting Firefox after you have connected the HDMI cable and selected the HDMI audio output.\n", "Q: Upgraded to iOS 11 iPhone 5S won't connect to data I have an iPhone 5S that I upgraded to iOS 11 and now it will no longer connect to data when I have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned off. \nMy Carrier is T-Mobile and I have Wi-Fi Calling enabled.\n\nA: Disable Wi-Fi Calling.

Here is a small introduction to my Situation:\nFor the sake of an example, I'm running a small IT firm developing really nice banana Software solely on MacBooks. My employees, mainly lazy monkeys, are allowed to link iCloud with their private Apple ID. One day, one of my employees decides to leave my Company, though refuses to deauthorize his iCloud account.\nSince my IT admin doesn't think that deauthorizing the iCloud account is necessary, he simply wipes the MacBook and calls it a day.\nSceptical me does a little Research and finds the following link:\nWhat to do if I sold my MacBook Air and didn't disable iCloud\nOne Comment states:\n\nThis is not entirely true. If you do not remove your iCloud account\n  from your old device, it will remain with that device. Our company\n  sold our fleet of Mac Air's and a few had iCloud set up. These\n  machines were all wiped and re-imaged, then sold. The new users never\n  set up iCloud so that account is blank. HOWEVER, we still had access\n  to those sold machines via iCloud! We could wipe and/or lock at-will,\n  even after removing that device from your iCloud account. Annoying and\n  potentially dangerous. You have to have the new user create a new\n  iCloud account and request approval from the old user to proceed.\n  Ridiculous!

Now we know disassociating before sale is imperative.\n\nSo here is my question:\nIs my former employee still able to remotely wipe the MacBook?\n\nA: If you want to completely \"unlink\" your MacBook from iCloud/Apple ID, change the Airport Card (WiFi adapter).\nApple uses hardware identifiers, including the embedded MAC (Media Access Control, not \"Macintosh\") address to uniquely identify it. \nChange out that card, and your Mac will no longer be linked to the iCloud account.  They are relatively inexpensive and very easy to change - just remove the back cover and the single retaining screw holding it.\n\nFinally, this should be a good example of why you don't allow employees to register company owned hardware as their personal devices.\n", "Q: Apple Mail on iOS 10 loses email message when you switch apps?

How do I do that?\nSpecifically, I am choosing \"connector line\" from the top menu.\n\nI then want to add another green bend point to make the line curve multiple times. How do I do that?\n\n\nA: The tool to use for this is the Draw with the pen tool.\nThis tool is found at the top right of the shape picker window.\n\nTo add a new point, drag a midpoint to divide a line and add a new point.  See the illustration below.\n\n\nA: Here's another tip !\nYou can also \"double click\" at the green bend point and keynote will automatically convert curve connector line to elbow connector line.\nThis helps to avoid other shape if you create complicated diagram.\n\nA: I like the corner tool more than the draw with pen tool, since it’s easier to maintain right-angles and it links to other shapes, so when you move them, the corner line automatically adjusts. The auto-adjust isn’t so intelligent, but then keynote isn’t a real drafting app.\nTo get more midpoints I just create a small square shape the same color as the corner line and then copy and paste my corner line and link both to the square. It’s a bit of a cludge, but looks great.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 - message saying accessory may not be supported I have an iPhone 6 which I recently updated to ios 11. Before the system update, I would occasionally get a notice saying \"This accessory may not be supported\" with a dismiss button. I have since updated to ios 11 but the notice still randomly appears. I know of nothing I do which triggers it or how it originated. Does anyone know how to stop this message from appearing?\n\nA: I have updated my system to ios 11.2.1 and the message has stopped appearing. That seemed to be a fix.\n", "Q: What happened to Shared Links in Safari 11.0 Apparently \"Shared Links\" no longer works in Safari 11.0 - see e.g. http://www.openradar.me/33142258 though I only saw this today for the first time when Apple pulled a Microsoft and auto-updated Safari (apparently, anyway).  See this picture for how it looks now - there should be three tabs on the far left.\n\nAny notions on what happened here?  I assume there is a plist I can search through to at least see whether it just lost all my RSS feeds, that would be helpful, though if someone has a hack that would be better.\n(Yes, I have attempted to use other free RSS readers, but they don't integrate as well with ordinary web browsing as this by a long shot.)\n\nA: You can find a plist of your feeds at ~/Library/Safari/WebFeedSources.plist. Use this command to get a list in a human-readable format:\nplutil -p ~/Library/Safari/WebFeedSources.plist\n\nIt is annoying that the Shared Links feature was removed in Safari 11 -- Apple seems to add/remove RSS support every few years...\n", "Q: Where is the App Store wishlist in iOS 11? Ever since updating to iOS 11, I haven’t been able to locate my wish list anywhere in the App Store.\nI had quite a few apps saved that I was planning on purchasing once the price dropped, but any trace of my wishlist seems to have vanished.\nHow do I access my App wishlist in iOS 11?\n\nA: The wish list has been completely removed from iOS 11 and iTunes 12.7.\nThis article confirms my statement:\n\nWith iOS 11, you get a truckload of new features but you also lose some pretty useful things. Having already killed 32-bit apps on iOS, Apple has now removed wish lists from the App Store. Since Apple removed iOS apps from iTunes as well, there’s now no way to add apps to your wish list or to see which apps were there in your wish list on iOS 10.\n\nYou can share apps into Notes as a workaround.\n\nA: We made a simple app as a replacement:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/your-app-wishlist/id1287493475?l=de&ls=1&mt=8\nfree & no ads :)\n", "Q: How do I turn off driving warnings? Since I updated to iOS 11 it's been warning me about using the phone while driving. I'm not driving. I'm on public transportation. How do I turn off the warning?\n\nA: This is how it's designed - you need to override it each time the device detects a potential driving situation.\nYou need to turn the feature off manually one by one or once systematically to disable the checks and warnings.\nHow to disable automatic Do Not Disturb While Driving\nBy default in iOS 11, the feature is set to switch on automatically in the background. If you're almost always the driver, and rarely a passenger, you can leave it like this.\nWhen it activates you get a permanent notification show up on your lock screen indicating that it is doing its thing. If you're driving, leave it alone. If you're a passenger, you can long-press on the lock screen notification and choose to deactivate it. \nIf you're almost always the passenger and rarely the driver, you can stop it coming on automatically by heading to Settings > Do Not Disturb then scroll to the bottom of the screen and tap on the \"Activate\" option. Here you can choose the \"Manually\" option so that it never comes on by itself. \nOnce you have chosen the manual activation, you can add a control to Control Centre by going to Settings > Control Centre > Customise Control Centre and adding the Do Not Disturb While Driving control. Now you just need to swipe up to reveal Control Centre and tap the little car icon to activate it. \nFrom: http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/142217-how-to-disable-or-customise-do-not-disturb-while-driving-in-ios-11\n", "Q: How to import data into numbers properly So I have a file with data, see link below:\nhttp://www.epsilon-uitgaven.nl/bijlagen/E76/E76-tweelingdata.txt\nI'm trying to import this into numbers, but what I get is the following:\n\nInstead of having separate columns for 1, 167, 2, and 4 (this is the first cell), I just have one column for the entire data.

I tried to go back from iOS 11 to iOS 10.3.3 and this happens. Now, I am stuck with apparently a bricked phone. Things that I tried:\n1. Going to recovery mode in iTunes and doing the restore (I guess this automatically goes to the last iOS version, so 11). Result is 2006 error\n2. Going to recovery mode in iTunes, option+click the restore button and choosing the .ipsw file of iOS 10.3.3. Result is 2006 error.\n3.

They also appear with another laptop. Nothing happens if I wiggle all the cables hooked up to the display; the striping is consistently there.\nI fear this means the display is toast and it's time to get a new one. Do I have any repair options? Any chance it's the adapter?\n\n\nA: I had a similar experience with an ACD30 (circa 2006, refurb) connected to a MacBook Pro via Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter. Fought display anomalies for about 18 months with Apple unable to identify any problem with display nor laptop.\nIn 2015, I finally found the following article on Apple's support site. \nMini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter: Resolving flickering and wake from sleep issues\nI confirmed the adapter I was using had a firmware of 1.01 and thought it worth a try to have it updated or replaced.\nI took both the adapter and a copy of the page from Apple's site to the Genius Bar. The representative argued that he could find no such page on Apple's support site (Though the link still works today, it has been updated and archived.) and that it wouldn't fix my display problems. I firmly insisted that based on the page he at the least upgrade the adapter's firmware. He told me that wasn't possible and finally agreed to order a new adapter at Apple's expense.\nThe good news is a week later a new adapter with firmware 1.03 fixed all my display problems. I'm still using the same 11 year old display two years later.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How delete an application that is bundled with macOS? Backstory: \nI am running macOS Sierra and use TextEdit a lot. The problem is that I hate the Versions save schema that causes the universal Save As shortcut of CmdShiftS to instead create a copy of the document. I also hate how Auto-Save makes permanent changes to documents I don't want to modify when I'm tentatively modifying a work-in-progress. Since the introduction of these nuisance features in Lion I have always backed up and then replaced TextEdit.app with the legacy 1.6 version from Snow Leopard.\nThe problem:\nToday when I tried to delete TextEdit.app from my Applications folder using this Terminal command\nsudo rm -rf /Applications/TextEdit.app\n\nI got this error\nrm: TextEdit.app: Operation not permitted\n\nI was surprised to find that I can't kill it, even with sudo.\nHow can I actually get rid of an application that is bundled with macOS?\nWhat I've tried so far:\nI followed the instructions in this article, but it didn't work. I also read this SE answer, which almost accomplishes the same solution by means of disabling Versions and Auto-Save, but then I don't get the benefit of legacy TextEdit's temporary backup saving feature. See the part in the answer stating \"This effectively disables the old-style, pre-Lion autosaving completely\". \nSo I think deleting the newer TextEdit v1.12 and replacing it with the legacy v1.6 is still the best option, however I can't get my system to delete it.

I've just had to replace a second battery on my iPhone 6 in under a year. The batteries were most likely damaged due to overheating. I talked to the repair person about the best way to prevent this in the future. He gave me three suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Avoid charging your phone for more than 4 hours at a time (ie- don't charge over night).\n\n*Remove from the case before charging or whenever it gets hot.\n\n*Power down the phone before charging.\n\n\nBased on many posts in this forum, #1 is incorrect #2 seems like quite a good idea. I might even purchase a different case that would give the phone better breathing room.\nHowever, I am unsure about #3. Does powering down your iPhone before a charge help make the battery last? Does it do anything positive?\n\nA: There is no need to turn off your iPhone.\nI have asked Apple customer service the same question and they told me no need to do this at all. \nBut you can use up iPhone battery to power off and then thoroughly charge it to 100% once a month.

I do not use iCloud to sync my Mac and I have several Safari Bookmarks.plist files that were manually backed up at different times. Thus each contain some of the same items while some contain items the others do not.\nHow can the contents of these Bookmarks.plist files be merged together?\n\nA: Neither macOS or Safari provide a direct way to merge multiple Bookmarks.plist files so as not to contain duplicate items.\nSome choices are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually import each Bookmarks.plist file (Safari > File > Import Bookmarks...) and then manually arrange and reorganize while manually deleting duplicates. \n\n*Use a third-party utility to manage the Bookmarks.plist files so as to utilize any tools the third-party utility provides to remove duplicate items.\n\n\n*\n\n*BookmarkApp: sort & delete duplicate bookmarks\n\n\n*\n\n*Developer Website\n\n*Mac App Store Preview\n\n\n*URL Manager Pro : the bookmark manager\n\n\n*\n\n*Developer Website\n\n*Mac App Store Preview\n\n\n*Safari Extensions - Search for: bookmarks - At the time of this search it contained \"69 results found for 'bookmark'\", and some may have the capacity to remove duplicates.\n\n*Google, or other Search Engine, for other third-party utilities to manage Bookmarks.\n\n\n*Write your own utility to manage Safari Bookmarks to remove all duplicates from a set of combined Bookmarks.plist files.\n\n\nNote: I am not affiliated with, nor have used the utilities mentioned herein.\n", "Q: Mobile Safari updates for older iOS versions I am aware that Safari for iOS is updated whenever iOS is updated.\nFor devices that cannot update to iOS 11:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can the Safari on those devices ever be update to recent versions (outside of the iOS upgrade)?\n\n*Does the Safari for those devices receive any updates at all (e.g. security)?\n\n\nA: No. Safari only updates with iOS releases. If there is a very serious security concern Apple might release another (iOS) update to a previous version, that adds security fixes to Safari, but never Safari by itself, and no new features.\nOn MacOS however you can still download Safari updates for newer OSs.\n", "Q: Dragging PDFs out of safari Is there a way of dragging an open PDF out of safari into another app without saving it and then having to delete it like to the files app or notes?\n\nA: So, I just found out I have this unanswered question.

How to keep photos synced without uploading them to Apple servers? (aka iCould Photo Library)\nI use Import feature of Photos app on macOS, it copied all photos from iPhone. But some minutes later, iTunes copied all downloaded photos from my mac to iPhone again! So I had duplicated photos on iPhone.\nNote that I'm using macOS 10.12.6 and iOS 11.\n\nA: To solve the issue with Photos.app and duplicate photos appearing on your iPhone, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your Mac using a USB cable\n\n*Open Photos.app\n\n*Select 'Delete items'\n\n\nThis will delete your photos after they've been imported in Photos.app. This will prevent any duplicate photos from appearing in Photos.app on your iPhone.\n\nOn you Mac you can set up Image Capture.app so it a) copies all images/videos on your iPhone and b) deletes all images/videos afterwards. The following instructions work without Photos.app.\nStep 1.\nMake sure to disable Settings > Photos > iCloud Photo Library.

I am planning to start using a zero-knowledge cloud service (sync.com) for all my files, to have a secure backup and as a way to share certain files with others. I was wondering if the two types of encryption will work alongside each other. If so, where in the process does the cloud encryption engage, and where does filevault take over? Will there be unnecessary redundancy in the two encryptions (perhaps with longer waiting times)? \nJust trying to picture what will happen. Thanks!\n\nA: On macOS, FileVault is encryption at rest so it’s designed to protect your files when the operating system isn’t operating. Just as you can see an email or text document once you log in and your password decrypts the drive, any apps can read clear versions of your files and send them to the cloud in the clear, print them in the clear. \nHaving FileVault doesn’t make things slower or faster, so you can pretty much exclude that from your worries and plans about whatever cloud sharing service and program you select. \nThat service will be fast or slow, secure or not on its own design and merits regardless of the status of FileVault. \n", "Q: Can you use the Apple Magic Keyboard with a Windows Machine as well? I just wanted to ask if it is possible to use Apple`s Magic Keyboard with a Windows machine (given that it has bluetooth). Is this possible? \n\nA: Yes, the new Magic keyboard works just fine (the 2017 wireless extended one that is) with the supplied USB/lightning cable. In fact I'm using a third-party PUR braided cable, typing on the Apple keyboard right now. There's a tiny On/Off switch on the back right edge, that needs to be on even if you are plugged into USB. My cheesy Dell here at work doesn't have BT but I'll get a cheap dongle from Amazon and try it.\nNext I will use KeyTweak and remap some of the keys. Right now Command is the Windows key and the tiny Option ket is ALT. Those need to b reversed so they are used to where we know them. I also like to to make F16 my Play/Pause button for iTunes, and F17 & F18 my Up-Down Volume keys and F19 my Mute. Oh, and F13 Print Screen, and the Clear button I make Num Lock. These are just my suggestions but for Windows it works. There's no way to program the Eject button to do anything but Optical is fading into the horizon anyway, lol. All This changes the registry in Win 10 so if you pop on a std keyboard, make sure to run KeyTweak again to reset the Registry back to normal!\nWhy go through all this for a Windows machine? Sanity. Got my first Mac in '90 (16lb Portable) and my SE/30 is sitting right next to me in my office. If I have to use Windows, at least my keyboard interaction is Apple. All my devices are, lol.\nBTW, KeyTweak is downright confusing to use. Here's how you do it. It'll take a little time but worth it.\nFor EACH Key you want to change:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Half Teach Mode\n\n*In the windows that pops up, click Scan Single Key\n\n*Then press the key you want to change. For example, I clicked F19. You'll see a numeric ID for the key appear.\n\n*Then select, from the DropDown, what Function you want the selected key to do. In my example I selected Mute.\n\n*Then click the Remap button.\n\n\nAt that point you will see your choice in the Pending Changes Box. Continue on changing all the keys you need by REPEATING ALL THE STEPS.\nOnce done, click Apply. THAT will change the Registry and remap your keys! IMPORTANT: The app will ask if you want to reboot. Say NO. Instead, go to File-->Save Remap File As, and save your mapping. Then if you ever have to reinstall Windows, just open KeyTweak and load the file! Or if you put an Apple keyboard on another machine, do the same, and you won't have to redo all the tedious mapping.\nNOW you can reboot for it all to take effect. ;-D\n\nA: Yes, it will work as a Bluetooth keyboard but you’ll have to think about drivers if you’re not running in Boot Camp. Apple does offer the required drivers with Boot Camp Assistant.app (> Action > Download Windows Support Software) and you could try transferring it to your Windows installation.\n\nYou can see all mappings on Apple's support page.

Even still, you are fixing a 6+ year old drive which is now outside it's useful life.\nIf the drive is still good (physically) but you can't repair the volume, you could format and reinstall macOS, but if this is the route you have to take, I would go with an SSD upgrade; thus my initial recommendation.\n", "Q: How to properly set SSD Fan Control on iMac late 2009 after SSD upgrade I’ve upgraded my late 2009 iMac 27” with an SSD hard drive.\nBecause of the fan noise, I’ve installed SSD Fan Control, but I’m not sure how to set it properly, avoiding to reach high internal temperature that could damage hardware.\nUsing “SMART” mode fan are very quiet; using “Auto” mode are more noisy.\nFor now my settings are the following:\n\nWhat does “1100 RPM @ 45 C” means? On the screenshot you can see that the temperature is 38°C, but the fan RPM is 1499...\nDo you think these are good settings for me?\nThanks very much for the help\nFrancesco\n\nA: The fan is running at 1499RPM at 38C, despite the settings of 1100RPM at 45C, because of a harmless bug in the SSD Fan Control app.\nThe bug is easy to reproduce:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Manual, and set the speed to 1500RPM\n\n*Select SMART, and the fan stays at 1499-1500 RPM\n\n\nTo \"kick\" the app back in to correct SMART operation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the lower bound to a value below the ambient temperature (30C, for example), such that the fan speed increases\n\n*Set the lower bound back to 45C\n\n\nProblem solved.\nAs for installing a temperature sensor, forget it. Francesco has a late 2009 model iMac 27\" - these were not shipped with temperature sensors taped to the drive, rather with a proprietary cable connection direct to a special extra port on the drive.\nThe SSD Fan Control app works brilliantly on these old machines, once you understand the strange behaviour of this bug (and the workaround, described above).\n\nA: This is one of those scenarios that leave me scratching my head because it's solution to a symptom without a  basic  understanding the of the problem (aka an XY Problem)\n\"1100 RPM and 45C\" means:\n\n\n*\n\n*The fan is spinning at 1,100 Revolutions Per Minute (RPM)\n\n*45C is the temperature in Celsius (45 degrees Celsius or 113 in Fahrenheit)\nYour fans spin up for one single reason only, the temp readings has indicated the the temperature is a certain level and needs to cool things down.  What you have essentially done here with SMCFanControl is to override the system's ability to properly cool your iMac.\nSo, to properly control the fan in your iMac, you need to address the problem:\nThe issue, most likely, is that after your upgrade of the SSD, you didn't account for the in-line temperature sensor which sends the correct data back to the fan controller.   \n", "Q: How can I restrict apps from using WiFi? As we know that we can \"use mobile data for\" a particular app so WhatsApp for instance can be allowed to use mobile data while other apps can't.\nHow can I accomplish the same for WiFi data use?\n\nA: There is no ios level switch for preventing WiFi or USB tethered  data connections on a per app basis. Disabling WiFi you don’t trust is the first step. \nThe next practical method to do this is control the network with firewalls, proxies and DNS / routing to block whatever access patterns you need to control or monitor. \nUnless the specific app has a sign off / sign out/ disable feature or configuration option, deleting the app entirely is the last lever available if you cannot control the network. \n", "Q: How do I share my iCloud storage with my family in iOS 11?

Some things I've tried include setting Application Shortcuts, and modifying key actions in the keyboard settings (i.e., setting ⌘ to take the action ⌥) -- these sort of work, but still leave me without several shortcuts.\nShortcuts I'm specifically hoping to get on my Mac:\n- ctrl + c : copy\n- ctrl + v : paste\n- ctrl + x : cut\n- ctrl + a : select all\n- ctrl + s : save\n- ctrl + shift + s : save all\n- end : end of line\n- home : front of line\n- ctrl + end : end of document\n- ctrl + home : front of document\n\nI know there are tons more that I'd like, but I assume if I can get the Ctrl, Shift, End, and Home keys working, then the rest of my normal keyboard shortcuts will kind of fall into place from there.\nSo basically, I'm looking for a way to get my Windows keyboard to act like a Windows keyboard, on a Mac. Is this possible?\n\nA: This question has already been asked (Windows shortcut support for macOS Sierra) and (quasi) answered in a comment by @Tetsujin\n\nHonestly, you will be better off long-term learning the difference\n  rather than trying to force the Mac to behave like Windows. I've been\n  working cross-platform for 25 years & I've found no better system than\n  'just work with it, not against it'\n\nTo further expand on this, it's important to note that the shortcuts in macOS are not just universal, they are part of the standards for UX/UI design for macOS.  Every application (developer) expects this to be the case and may use the shortcuts you referenced above for app specific functions.  Remapping those to conform to Windows will undoubtedly cause issues.\nFrom Apple's macOS Human Interface Guidelines under Keyboard:\n\nRespect standard keyboard shortcuts and create app-specific shortcuts for frequently used commands. Keyboard shortcuts let\n  people activate menu items and actions by pressing specific key\n  combination.\n\nAnd finally,  as I have said in the comments of the same linked question:\n\nI came from Windows (on the Desktop, UNIX on the server) background\n  and I still use 3 platforms (Mac, Windows, BSD) almost daily. After a\n  little while, you easily switch from Windows to Mac shortcuts and\n  vice-versa.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Install https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/\n\n*Find PC-style shortcuts complex_modifications rules here https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/?q=%20PC-Style%20Shortcuts\n\n*Click import.\n\n*Enable all rules that you need in Karabiner-Elements app.\n\n*If you want to customize shortucts, edit ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/[some-number-here].json, which will be the imported file. You can learn from the other examples and do your own stuff.\n\n\nA: Just go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys and change Control (^) Key: to ⌘ Command. All your windows shortcuts should work. I needed the same thing.\n", "Q: Playing movies off our iPad at the cottage Our cottage does not have broadband access (even 3G/LTE is really marginal) so I'm trying to find a solution so we can get some movies at home and then watch them. At the cottage we have an Epson projector and a TV with HDMI.\nWe purchased a Lightning->HDMI connector, but when we attempt to play movies we downloaded to the iPad from iTunes, it states this is not allowed. I honestly don't recall what happens when we try the VGA input to the projector, but I seem to recall is says the same thing. And I tried getting the non-HD versions and that did the same thing.\nSo is there any way to do this? I know there have been licensing changes recently, does it effect any of this? Is there a setting I can use or some other type of connector that allows this?\n\nA: Your best, but not least expensive, option is to buy an Apple TV.  \nThis will allow you to AirPlay movies from your iPad (as well as any other Apple device) to your HDTV without using any cables.\nI personally use my Apple TV to do this exact thing on TVs where we don't have a cable connection.\nYou can buy a new or used one but I wouldn't buy a used one older than version 3.\nThe movies you're trying to play using the cable might have HDCP copyright protection.  \n", "Q: Can't delete a greyed out app on iPhone 4S I can't delete a greyed out Google Translate application.

So I was making this program that would write every number between 0 and 9999, but I need it to be 4 characters long no matter what the digit count is - the only way to do that, I think, is to have the program count the digits and then put it into a variable, subtracting that variable from 4 and adding that number of zeros before the number itself.\nHow can AppleScript count the digits? Is there even a way to do it at all?\n\nA: Apple Developer > Mac Automation Scripting Guide contains an example how to add leading zeros to a number as AppleScript as well as JavaScript code:\n\nAdding Leading Zeros to a Number\nThe handlers in Listing 20-11 and Listing 20-12 convert a number to a string and prepends it with leading zeros until it reaches a certain length. They accept two parameters—the number to add leading zeros to and the maximum number of leading zeros to add. For example, if the maximum number of leading zeros is set to 2, the results range from 001 to 999. If the maximum number of leading zeros is 3, the results range from 0001 to 9999, and so on.\n\nAppleScript listing:\non addLeadingZerosToNumber(theNumber, theMaxLeadingZeroCount)\n    -- Determine if the number is negative\n    set isNegative to theNumber is less than 0\n\n    -- Determine when the maximum number of digits will be reached\n    set theThreshold to (10 ^ theMaxLeadingZeroCount) as integer\n\n    -- If the number is shorter than the maximum number of digits\n    if theNumber is less than theThreshold then\n        -- If the number is negative, convert it to positive\n        if isNegative = true then set theNumber to -theNumber\n\n        -- Add the zeros to the number\n        set theLeadingZeros to \"\"\n        set theDigitCount to length of ((theNumber div 1) as string)\n        set theCharacterCount to (theMaxLeadingZeroCount + 1) - theDigitCount\n        repeat theCharacterCount times\n            set theLeadingZeros to (theLeadingZeros & \"0\") as string\n        end repeat\n\n        -- Make the number negative, if it was previously negative\n        if isNegative = true then set theLeadingZeros to \"-\" & theLeadingZeros\n\n        -- Return the prefixed number\n        return (theLeadingZeros & (theNumber as text)) as string\n\n      -- If the number is greater than or equal to the maximum number of digits\n    else\n        -- Return the original number\n        return theNumber as text\n    end if\nend addLeadingZerosToNumber\n\nIf you prefer JavaScript check the link.\n\nA: Here is a simple handler that, pads based on your question.\nExample AppleScript code:\nset theNumber to 1\n\nset theNumber to padNumberAsString(theNumber)\n\non padNumberAsString(n)\n    set theLength to (get length of (n as string))\n    if theLength is equal to 1 then\n        set n to \"000\" & n\n    else if theLength is equal to 2 then\n        set n to \"00\" & n\n    else if theLength is equal to 3 then\n        set n to \"0\" & n\n    end if\n    return n\nend padNumberAsString\n\n\nResult: \"0001\"\n\n\nAs a demo, this creates and displays a list of the padded numbers between 0 and 1000 to show the padding is taking place.\nset thePaddedList to {}\nrepeat with i from 0 to 1000\n    set end of thePaddedList to padNumberAsString(i)\nend repeat\nchoose from list thePaddedList\n\non padNumberAsString(n)\n    set theLength to (get length of (n as string))\n    if theLength is equal to 1 then\n        set n to \"000\" & n\n    else if theLength is equal to 2 then\n        set n to \"00\" & n\n    else if theLength is equal to 3 then\n        set n to \"0\" & n\n    end if\n    return n\nend padNumberAsString\n\n", "Q: Prevent the Siri Watch Face from displaying Photo Memories The Siri Watch Face, introduced with watchOS 4, automatically suggests content, including \"Photo Memories\" from the iOS Photos app.\nI'm not keen on having year-old photos on my wrist, I much prefer stuff that actually are day-to-day relevant there.\nI've tried to get rid of these Photo Memory items, but haven't succeeded:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turned off Photos notifications in the \"Watch\" app.\n\n*Turned off Photos notifications in the iOS Notifications settings.\n\n*Watched the \"Memory\", did not help.\n\n*Deleting the \"Memory\" helped getting rid of it, but a day later I get a new one.\n\n\nHelp!

I have an external hard drive that I bought for my laptop so I could back up the important stuff and do a clean install, as somehow I got that stupid MacCleaner adware thing on it and it was causing issues.  \nI've used Time Machine only back then, several months ago.  After doing a clean install, low an behold, someone's contact info directed me to update Adobe Acrobat and then quickly scrolled through some boxes where I accidentally clicked on something to install something similar (doh!).  I followed the instructions to get it off my laptop but I'm not sure it's all fully gone as I occasionally get some pop-ups.  \nQuestion, now that I'm backing up onto external drive again using Time Machine, will those little bad files also be backed up as well, or does Time Machine just back up files and applications? \n\nA: Time Machine cannot know which files you consider \"bad\" or \"good\".

Its sole purpose is to add a Local Storage folder to Apple's native Files app. Unlike a lot of other solutions I've tried, it doesn't add any sort of non-native UI on top of Apple's app, and allows you to save any type of file to its location.\nIt's also completely free with no ads or gotcha's (and open source, if that matters to you).\nI really wish I'd found this app sooner.\n\nA: According to the iPhone User Guide, this requires a third-party app with Files integration support.

Name it \"Files Local Storage\" or something.\n\n*Connect your device using a USB cable.\n\n*Install it on your device! Select your iPhone out of the list in the toolbar, and click the big \"play\" button in the top left.\n\n\nIt won't have an icon, unless you go to the trouble of adding one. You'll also need to go into Settings and switch the storage location from \"iCloud Drive\" to \"On My iPhone\".\nAlso, unless you have a Developer ID, which costs $99/yr at the time of writing, you may need to reinstall your app every week or so.\n\nIf you don't want to do this, I've heard that Documents by Readdle supports Files integration. I've never tried it, and I'm not absolutely sure that it does.\nOn the other hand, I have tried GoodReader. It doesn't support Files integration. (update: now it does!) It is also fantastic for file management, and has some good PDF features as well. It can even zip/unzip files and connect to various types of network servers, like SFTP.

From the feature list APFS supports per-file encryption. Hence by extension it should be possible to setup an encrypted folder (or at least just the files within that folder) with a password that is different than the user login password.  Similarly, it should be possible to encrypt users' home  directories with their own respective keys, and render them inaccessible to one another despite whatever their file permission says (similar to what Windows' NTFS able to do since the previous century).\nThe question is that how to do that from a user's point of view? I've yet to see any UI in the Finder that can do this in macOS High Sierra. Is there a way in the command-line to enable this?\n\nA: One possible way to do this without resorting to the command line is to create a resizable encrypted volume through Disk Utility. It acts as a folder that is decrypted during the mounting process. It supports APFS and AES 128/256.\nTo create a new blank encrypted folder:\nDisk util > new image > new blank image > set Format: APFS > choose encryption scheme > set Image Format: read/write > OK. \nTo encrypt an existing folder:\nDisk util > new image > new image from folder > APFS > choose encryption scheme > set Image Format: read/write > OK.\nThis will create the encrypted folder as a .dmg that is decrypted when you mount it.

The app that doesn't support Tags does have a way of going into even hidden folders, just by selecting \"Go To Folder\".  \nBut I'm not sure how to use that knowledge to then dig up where I should inform the app to go.\nI've just created a Smart Folder that only shows files Tagged with that specific Tag. However, this seems to be a file with the extension .savedSearch - so I'm not sure how to access that \"folder\" via the Terminal, figure out it's path and paste that onto the App that doesn't support Tags or Smart Folders.\nAlso, if I drag a Tag to the Terminal, it will show up as a .savedSearch too, but unfortunately I cannot access that either.\nSo, how do I organise my files using Tags so that I can access them on apps that have no support for Tags? I don't want to physically move the files around as that will take me months and months to do, time is limited as it is already.\nEdit: Nope, I don't want to create tags or smart folders using Terminal, just access them just like if it were a regular folder.\n\nA: What you could do is running a script which uses mdfind to symlink all files with a specific tag into a folder, and then access the files via this folder.\ncd TAG_FOLDER\nmdfind -0 kMDItemUserTags=\"Red\" | xargs -0 -n 1 -J % ln -s % .\n\n(Replace \"Red\" with the name of the tag you are looking for)\nIf several tagged files have the same name only the first one will get linked (you'll get a warning message for the others). And, of course, the commands needs to be rerun every time you add/remove the tag from a file.\nPS: There is a small caveat here. Not all applications handle symlinked files the same way. Test first whether an application writes a changed file back to the original place or just replaces the symlink with the updated version.\nPPS: \n\n\n*\n\n*mdfind -0 finds all files/folders matching the query (in this case the tag). The -0 ensures that the string passed to the next command is terminated by an ASCII NUL character (to ensure that file names containing spaces etc get handled correctly)\n\n*xargs -0 -n 1 -J % reads one line of input to build and execute a command. -J % sets the placeholder for the input line to %\n\n*ln -s % . symlinks the file/folder in % into the current directory (.)\n\n", "Q: Can I choose when Siri speaks on my Apple Watch?

I'm not a big fan of the native Mail app and the native Gmail app is okay but I believe lacks power user features, e.g. keyboard shortcuts.  Is there a way to access the full-blown desktop version of Gmail?  Do keyboard shortcuts and other features work as normal?  And is it better to do this using the Chrome browser app than the Safari browser app, or does it not make much of a difference?  Finally, is there a way to set up a shortcut to make the website as easily and quickly accessible as possible?\n\nA: Sure you can, you can use any browser available. Just realize that all browsers on all IOS devices use the same layout engine: Webkit. It's an Apple thing and hasn't changed since Apple allowed third party apps.\nAs for the keyboard shortcuts, it all depends on what the browser supports. Safari doesn't allow you to customize much. But there are other browsers (Chrome, iCab, etc.) that allow more customization and may allow you to set the User Agent to a desktop version of your favorite browser. Beats me if they will then support the whole suite of Gmail keyboard shortcuts, you'll have to test that.\nAnd you can save any bookmark as an icon that opens that browser with that web address. In Safari go to the page you want to save. Tap the sharing button and select \"Add to home screen,\" voila icon on your home screen. Most browsers let you do this as well.\n", "Q: Photos on iOS 11 re-uploading entire library to iCloud Since updating to iOS 11, Photos has been behaving strangely.

I’ve had times where things are blank and syncing for three to four days and it clear up so you might need do nothing but connect to WiFi and connect the device to power for a few 8 hour periods to let all the sync / upload / duplicate processes to run.\nYou might have something the code can’t resolve and need to get Tier 1 to refer you to engineering since Apple doesn’t let people contact iCloud engineering directly and you do need to work through support to get there if needed.\n", "Q: High CPU runs in launchd \nMy fan on my Mac has been running all the time.

Bluetooth actually stays on the whole time even if in the control center the bluetooth button isn’t even blue. \nGo open “settings”, and you’ll see that bluetooth is switched on (and maybe you thought it was off like in my case). If you turn it off in the settings, the bluetooth icon from the control center will get crossed, and from there it doesn’t get switched on automatically every time you disable airplane mode.\nGood Luck :)\n\nA: On iOS 11 - to disable bluetooth, you'll want to install a configuration profile to accomplish that. Note that the control center now keeps the Bluetooth and WiFi radios on when you disable them - only AirPlane mode truly turns them off and you can turn them on piecemeal when in AirPlane mode. That change may have required the one you wish to modify.\nApple's hardware and services need bluetooth for more than a dozen features all bundled under continuity / handoff / siri knowing which device is closes for \"hey siri\" so the vast majority of people need bluetooth on all the time for these to work.\nYou can make profiles with Server.app (which costs money) and with Apple Configurator 2 which is free. You may need to supervise your devices to control bluetooth at that granularity so read into that a bit and be sure to test your profile to be sure it does what you want.\n", "Q: How to disable autohide dock autohide when the app closes I'm not an AppleScript Ninja but so I followed this link to automatically hide dock when it opens Unreal Engine \ntell application \"System Events\"\n  set autohide of dock preferences to true\nend tell\ntell application \"UE4Editor\" to activate\n\nBut, how to disable autohide when Unreal Engine closes? I'm running this script as an App. \nIs there any way I can integrate this script to Unreal Engine app? So, I don't have to click on this app manually & everything is done for me behind the scenes automatically?\n\nA: If you do not want to worry about creating a race condition and having to close UE4Editor before shutting down, as mentioned in the other answer, then there is a nice app called EventScripts, for $3.99 USD at the App Store, that you can use to trigger AppleScript scripts and or Shell scripts when certain events are triggered.\nHere's an example AppleScript script that will hide/show the Dock when UE4Editor launches/quits:\non run eventArgs\n    set theAppName to applicationName in eventArgs\n    set theTrigger to trigger in eventArgs\n    if theTrigger is \"Application launched\" and theAppName is \"UE4Editor\" then\n        hideDock(true)\n    else if theTrigger is \"Application quit\" and theAppName is \"UE4Editor\" then\n        hideDock(false)\n    end if\nend run\n\non hideDock(b)\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set autohide of dock preferences to b\n    end tell\nend hideDock\n\nIn Script Editor, save the above AppleScript code as, e.g., UE4Editor - On Open and Close.scpt in ~/Library/Application Scripts/net.mousedown.EventScripts/, (after EventScripts is installed).\nNow in EventScripts, add the same script twice, while setting the Event for one to Application launched and the other to Application quit.\nNow, when UE4Editor launches, the Dock is hidden, and when UE4Editor quits the Dock is unhidden.\n\nEventScripts has a long list of events it can trigger a script on. Check out the links below for more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*EventScripts - Developers Website\n\n*EventScripts - Mac App Store Preview\n\n*EventScripts - Available Events and Parameters\n\n*EventScripts - Example Scripts\nNote: I'm not affiliated with the developer of EventScripts, just a satisfied customer.\n\nA: This depends on whether UE4Editor will launch from shell script, so I cannot test it... it works fine with TextEdit.\nSave this as a standalone app, rather than a script. It should work as either, but an app is tidier.\ntell application \"System Events\" to set autohide of dock preferences to true\ntell current application to do shell script \"/Applications/UE4Editor.app/Contents/MacOS/UE4Editor\"  \ntell application \"System Events\" to set autohide of dock preferences to false\n\nAs you are launching from shell script, the script app will hide the Dock, launch your editor, then simply wait until the UE4Editor quits, then continue from where it left off, hiding the Dock. It will then quit itself.\nThis does mean that it will look like it went Not Responding for the duration of your session, but that actually causes no issues in itself. I have script apps like this that sit open for a week or more & do no harm at all.\nNote: If you reboot the Mac whilst this is running, the Mac itself will restore your last Editor session & therefore will be in a race condition with the script. Make sure to quit the editor before shutting down or rebooting.\n", "Q: Which Intel \"generation\" is my Mac's CPU? While glancing through the marketing page of High Sierra, I read from the first footnote that: \n\n[…]  The playback of 4K HEVC content requires a Mac with a sixth‑generation Intel Core processor or newer.\n\nI don't know which nth generation my iMac's CPU is.

I have an iPhone 7 (32GB) with iOS 10.3.3 and it seems like I'm not getting any notifications like \"This App was updated\" or \"Some Updates are available\" or any kind of Badges of available updates on App Store.\nI have turned on All Notifications for App Store in Settings including Banners and Badges. I had my iPhone reset like 3-4 times (including Restore via iTunes) and it just didn't work. I have to manually go into the App Store every time and push it down to check for any available updates. Why can't it just happen automatically. I have seen updates badges on many other iPhones.\n\nA: You can enable automatic updates in Settings → iTunes & App Stores: switch on Updates under Automatic Downloads.\nWhen an app update is available, the App Store badge will be shown and the app downloaded at a later date.

This was the first MacBook with a DCI-P3 display and I got mine in December. I want to find out if this is a known problem and is this fixed in some of the later batches.\nThe color management profile for the display is retrieved from the hardware on every reboot and stored in /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Displays/Color LCD-<UUID>.icc where UUID is a hardware identifier. This profile is said to be individually calibrated in the factory during production.\nUpon examination, it appears that the hardware provided profile is more close to sRGB colorspace than to the DCI-P3 one.\nColor LCD colorspace over the generic Display P3 profile (gray).\n\nThe colorspace difference is quite visible on this screenshot. Inner triangle is Color LCD, outer is Display P3.\n\nWhen using Color LCD all the colors are blown to the P3 colorspace, resulting in quite vivid colors. Also I'm unable to view the Webkit color gamut site correctly. If I'm using the Display P3 profile everything looks better. In both cases I don't have an individually calibrated display.\nI would like to find out:\n\n\n*\n\n*If this is a recognized problem by Apple.

I have noticed quite a few times that after viewing a particular image and quitting Preview manually, Preview still remains active in the background sucking up huge chunks memory/RAM. It only stops after force quitting it. I don't know why this does happen!\n\nA: This is by design and expected behavior if your memory pressure is green in activity monitor. Both iOS and macOS will keep some apps resident until compressed memory or paging is called for and then purge them. Changes in the kernel relating to App Nap, sudden termination, background processing allow many more states for applications than just running and quit. \nWhy do you care whether the process is still in memory?  It's not running.  Preview.app supports Automatic Termination, the system will remove it from memory when it is necessary to to so.\n\nA: This happens a lot. Preview is supposed to auto-terminate – but often cannot. \nAs of this writing: this is a bug not fixed in Sierra and not fixed in High Sierra.\nEven force quitting the app from the Dock might surprise you: after one trigger-the-bug files hangs Preview, force quit the app from the Dock and open Activity Monitor. Even though the app has lost its indicator light in the Dock and will not show up if you switch through your applications with Cmd+Tab it may very well be still shown as running– and sometimes with quite a hefty CPU toll. Since this is a bug in all versions of Preview that are supposed to be able to be auto-terminated, you have not many options:\n\n\n*\n\n*disable auto-termination to mitigate some of these effects and get a bit more manual control over the situation with defaults write -g NSDisableAutomaticTermination -bool yes\n\n*if it happens: force-quit the app(-process) with Activity Monitor\n\n*or do it from Terminal: sudo killall Preview\nBest option of course is not to use the buggy program and choose an alternative picture and PDF viewer.\n", "Q: Strange colors on screen Can someone please help me solve ?  The screen suddenly turned blank with strange colors on the left, as the picture shows.\n\nA: Like Tetsujin commented this is physical damage to the screen.

The port can also support a Thunderbolt 3 display (limited to Thunderbolt 2 bandwidth), DisplayPort and HDMI adapters, and USB 3.1 gen 2 (10 Gbps) devices.\nThe Thunderbolt 3 port when originating from a Thunderbolt 2 computer can support one 4K 60Hz display or two 2560x1600 60Hz displays. The remainder of the 20 Gbps bandwidth can be used for PCIe data.\nWhile Apple's support document HT207448 \"Use the LG UltraFine 5K Display with your Mac\" says that the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13/15-inch, Mid 2014) can support 4K (on the UltraFine 5K Display to be specific), the corresponding Technical Specifications documents for the same MacBook Pros makes no mention of 3840x2160 60Hz capability.\nThe Apple support document HT207447 \"Use the LG UltraFine 4K Display with your Mac\" only mentions USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 Macs.\nThe Apple support document HT206587 \"Using 4K displays, 5K displays, and Ultra HD TVs with your Mac\", does mention 3840x2160 60Hz support for the MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) (having NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M graphics) but not the 13-inch (which only has Intel Iris Pro Graphics).\nMaybe (but unlikely) the UltraFine 5K Display is using an MST mode for it's 4K mode (as it does for it's 5K mode). Both the 13 and 15 inch 2014 Retina MacBook Pro definitely have the bandwidth for that. They support two 2560x1600 60Hz displays which is a similar amount of bandwidth required for a single 3840x2160 60Hz display.\n", "Q: \"Hey Siri\" doesn’t run if iPad locked and Smart Cover Closed in iOS 11 I have an iPad Pro 9.7 Wifi & Cellular 128 GB.  In iOS 10.3.3, I could call Siri with \"Hey Siri\" keyword even if iPad locked and Smart Cover closed. Now, I upgraded my device to iOS 11. The \"Hey Siri\" keyword runs only if iPad locked and Smart Cover is open. However; if iPad locked and Smart Cover closed, it doesn’t work. I've been using my iPad (in a Smart Cover) for \"Hey Siri what is the degree in my room\" for about a year now. It stopped responding only after updating to iOS 11. \"Hey Siri\" and \"Allow Siri while locked\" toggles are checked in Settings also.\n\nA: This is a known issue with iOS 11. Currently there is no way to turn \"Hey Siri\" back on with the Smart Cover covering the iPad's screen.\nPlease provide feedback to Apple so the feature can be brought back in future releases of iOS 11.\n", "Q: Terminal on Mac won't launch a shell - stuck on login: incorrect I've been having this issue for a while where I come to open the Terminal and I'm met with this:\nLogin incorrect\nlogin: _\n\nI've already deleted the com.apple.terminal.plist to no avail. The really interesting thing is that sometimes it works, maybe 1 in 50 times. I literally have no idea what might be causing it and after searching the web for the better part of half a day it seems everyone else's issues are fixed when they delete the plist file.\nHow do I sort this out? I've tried running different shells (bash and zsh), but I still get this log in screen.\nAlso when I use Activity Monitor, I can see there is no shell running just the login.\n\n\nA: What worked for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely close all terminal windows.\n\n*Open Finder from the Dock.\n\n*Press Command+Shift+G and type in ~/Library/Preferences/, then press enter.\n\n*Locate the file called com.apple.Terminal.plist and rename it (using highlight and then single click) to com.apple.Terminal.OLD.plist.\n\n*Re-open the terminal app.\n\n\nNote that the file might also show up in Finder as com.apple.Terminal if you do not show extensions by default.\n", "Q: Testing EFI integrity under Linux The utility in this article:  High Sierra automatically checks EFI firmware each week looks like it will improve security on a Mac running macOS, but is it available for Linux too?\n\nA: \nis it available for Linux too?\n\nIt's highly unlikely to be available in Linux.  \nThis is a macOS utility to improve the security of Apple Mac products.  Apple typically doesn't make available (aka open source) the tools they develop as they are proprietary to Apple.  There's no incentive for them to port this (or any other utility) to Linux since it's Apple's objective for you to run macOS on Apple hardware.\n", "Q: How to reset LAN ethernet adapter after switching the network I have MacBook Pro 2017. I have the very same docker hub at work and at home (moshi). Both have LAN cables attached. However, I can use only one of them: for example, when I make my work LAN working, I can't simply go home and have it home LAN working - and vice versa.\nIs there a way to reset LAN adapter? I tried to disable/enable it with ifconfig; however I am not sure which adapter is one for the LAN cable? I am not getting any IP address, and I was expecting something like 169.x.x.x\nEDIT: what I do now is to plug off the docker hub and then plug it on. I don't know why this matters on osx.\n\nA: Use \"Locations\" in Network Preferences\n\nCreate a location for work and another for home.  Next, set up your preferences for each location.  When you switch the location it will automatically reset your adapters and apply the new configuration.\n", "Q: Empty compressed memory Is there any way to empty the compressed memory used by an app without restarting this app?\nApps like Memory Cleaner or the purge command do not work!\n\nA: No, there's no way to do so.\nIf you could empty the compressed memory used by an app, the app would stop functioning and crash. Therefore it doesn't make sense to empty the compressed memory of running apps.\n", "Q: Excel API data query - populates into a single column I am trying to populate some data from an API call. \n(Below is the process to get the same example)\nEverything works fine until I hit the last button: all the data goes into the first column and does not seem to understand the separator.\n\nMind that my Language & Settings are for \"United Kingdom\" which should recognise comma as separator.\nProcess flow:\n\n\n*\n\n*create text file with \"https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/\"\n\n*change the .txt file into .iqy\n\n*Open Excel, go to Data tab\n\n*Get External Data then Run Saved Query\n\n*Open the .iqy file\n\n*Select new sheet and you're good to go.\n\n\nThanks for the help,\nChris\n\nA: It appears you are attempting to import data in JSON format which is not supported by Excel.\nDoing a cursory search, I was able to find an Excel plug-in that converts JSON to XLS (Free).\nI have not used this myself, so YMMV.\n", "Q: NTP not updating back to system time in macOS In macOS 10.12.6 , I am trying to forward the clock using the date command. \nE.g.: today's date is 25-09-2017 and I am setting it to 27-09-2017. But using ntp I am unable to revert my system time back to 25-09-2017. \nI have \"time.asia.apple.com\" set in /etc/ntp.conf.\nWhen I try to issue the command\nsudo killall -9 ntpd; sudo ntpdate \"time.asia.apple.com\"\n\nI am getting the following output:\n\n27 Sep 20:25:36 ntpdate[5085]: no server suitable for synchronization found\n\nI am not sure why my system time is not moving back to 25th of Sep.\nI even tried it with \"time1.google.com\" . The clock is still not returning back to today's date.\n\nA: \"no server suitable for synchronization found\" indicates that the time server time.asia.apple.com can't be found or in-bound ntp traffic is not allowed at some perimeter.\nYour host either has no proper Internet connection or DNS resolution is wonky.\nHowever, you can try to check your Internet connection (e.g. ping 8.8.8.8), repair the Internet if necessary (e.g. repair Internet local|global all) and repeat your ntpdate command or use one of the various IP addresses of time.asia.apple.com (17.253.52.125, 17.253.54.253, 17.253.54.125) directly: \nsudo ntpdate 17.253.54.125\n\nIf the last command works DNS resolution is broken.\n\nrepair Internet local|global all shouldn't be taken literally.\n", "Q: How do I change the shortcut for lock screen? In macOS High Sierra, the new Lock Screen shortcut was added, but you can only use the shortcut  ^   ⌘   Q . I'd like to change it to something more Windows-esque, like  ⌘   ⌥   L . How can I go about this? \n\nA: You can do this by following this webpage instructions :\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Open \"Keyboard\" preference pane\n\n*Go to \"Shortcuts\" tab\n\n*Select \"App Shortcuts\"\n\n*Click \"+\"\n\n*Select \"All Applications\". In the \"Menu Title\" field type \"Lock Screen\" and press your shortcut\n\n*Quit System Preferences\n\n\nA: Some shortcuts are not honored by macOS (Ctrl+Shift +Escape, for example).\nIf you find that the default system shortcut tool doesn't work for you, you can add your desired keyboard shortcut using BetterTouchTool.\nThis way you will be able to lock the screen with the default shortcut as well as your pre-defined shortcut.\n", "Q: Does the CPU of your Macbook Pro overheat when gaming using a Thunderbolt external GPU? Does the CPU of your Macbook Pro overheat when gaming using a Thunderbolt external GPU ? \nAny feedback from fellow gamers using an external GPU ? Thanks !\n\nA: No, the CPU does not overheat. \nThere's no extra CPU-load from the fact that you're using an external GPU compared to an internal GPU.\nIn addition your CPU cannot overheat in a functioning MacBook Pro. The system will use the fans to cool down the CPU. In the event the fans are not functioning (i.e. broken hardware), the MacBook Pro would simply turn off instead of overheating.\n\nA: It shouldn't, because your eGPU is handling the intensive stuff.\n", "Q: df -h command in Terminal shows wrong amount of disk space I recently ran df -h on my Mac using Terminal. I was surprised to find that it shows my internal volume can store 112 GB, but it can actually store 120 GB. \nSo I can't understand why this happens and should I worry about.\nThe Size column shows as 112 GB.\n\nA: Apple measures gigabytes as 1,000,000,000 bytes (in the decimal system) for advertising purposes whereas dh properly uses binary, converted to decimal, which means it's actually 1,073,741,824 bytes.\nIf you take 120,000,000,000 (Apple's advertised capacity) and divide it by 1,073,741,824 you get 111.75 GB when properly measured in binary.\nIf you visit:\nhttps://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/\nand scroll ALL the way to the bottom of the page, you can see footnote #1:\n1. 1GB = 1 billion bytes and 1TB = 1 trillion bytes; actual formatted capacity less.\n\n\nA: There's no need to worry. \nThe actual available space on the drive after formatting is always less than the advertised space of the drive itself. This is the case across file systems and operating systems, no matter if you're using macOS, Windows or Linux.\nThe fact that you're seeing different numbers at different times indicate that you're looking at the Avail column, which tells you how much free space you have. This number will change over time as you add and remove files and data from the drive. The Mac will do this without you knowingly saving/deleting files - for example due to swap space. Therefore no reason for alarm.\n", "Q: How to disable all caches in safari 11? I am using Safari to develop for a while. One thing I always liked is when you clear the cache, it really does, unlike other browsers I tried in the past. But in previous versions, specially when working in a code in a local testing server, just reloading the page will reload everything from disk. Now I have to use de shortcut command+alt+e to clear before reload or some new CSS won't load, even some http request will return old values. Just reloading the page won't guarantee to show me the last modifications.\nI looked at preferences and develop menu but didn't find an option to just don't use any caches at all - the perfect option will be don't use caches when I have the web inspector opened, means I am developing.\nDid I miss this option, or there is another way to disable all caches?\n\nA: In the Web Inspector, under the Network tab, unselect ‘Use the resource cache when loading resources’. Blue means the cache is not used, black means the cache is used.\n                                                \nAs you wished, this only takes effect when the web inspector is open. Note that this is a cache bypass, not a permanent ‘cache empty’, so when you un-bypass the cache, any cache from prior to the bypass will be used. To use the latest resources with the web inspector closed, empty the cache using the button to the right or Develop → Empty Caches (⌥⌘E).\nCurrently, in Safari Technology Preview there is a re-designed Network tab in the Web Inspector with a new cache bypass icon, which I expect to make its way to Safari soon.\n                                                \n\nA: I'm not near my Mac right now, (was searching how to disable all caches in iOS Safari) but you could try to disable all write permissions to the Safari cache folder in Terminal. It might crash Safari, but probably it will just spam your log file with 'can't save cache' messages, so it might also slow down your Mac a tiny bit because of it constantly writing to the log. \nCaveat: This hack solution might not survive an MacOS update, and might even cause problems during an update. I haven't actually tested this, don't have a Mac nearby, just an iPad, so a lot of mights. \n", "Q: What happened to Bonjour in Safari 11 and how do I access it? I need to access Bonjour to get information from my printer and wonder where Bonjour has gone from Safari version 11.\n\nA: Apple clearly removed that item from the Safari menu.\nMy take on this is everyone is wondering about Safari 11 and Bonjour.  There is a suggestion that Apple needs to be reminded that it is huge to have Bonjour in Safari to manage printers, access scanners, even see some HomeKit device tech interfaces.\nEveryone trusted Apple on Bonjour... and Safari is the preeminent end user tool to use and be introduced to the benefits of Bonjour...\nconsider posting your opinion on Safari-sans-Bonjour at:\nBonjour Feedback: https://www.apple.com/feedback/bonjour.html\n\nA: In their wisdom, Apple have removed it without providing a direct workaround. In the meantime, you can use something like Bonjour Browser, which is less convenient but will at least get you to the right URLs for admin UIs etc.\n\nA: One option is to use this Safari Extension to bring back the functionality: https://bonjourbrowser.com\n\nA: You can access it via System Preferences | Printers & Scanners.  Access the Options & Supplies button\n\nThen select this button\n\n", "Q: How to get the wifi password off a school wifi without going up to the router I have an iPad for school and I want to see the password for the wifi so I can put it into my android phone but I'm not able to go up to the router unless I want to get suspended please help.\n\nA: WiFi passwords are saved to a hidden location on your device and you can't see them as you can do on a computer.\n", "Q: Does Time Machine support APFS? I just updated to macOS High Sierra. What's the best way to use Time Machine under Apple's new APFS file system. Should I use Disk Utility to convert my external Time Machine volume to APFS?\n\nA: Time Machine supports APFS as a source and not a destination. You can't backup to an APFS destination disk and Time Machine will inform you that the disk needs to be HFS+ if you attempt to do this.\nRight now, there's nothing you need to or should do. Your internal disk has been converted to APFS and your backup disk is still on HFS+, so Time Machine will function as it always has, and will continue to inherit previous backups despite the difference in format. On a future date when Time Machine supports APFS destinations, you can convert your backup disk.\n\nA: Until Time Machine is updated, it does not support APFS on the backup disks.\nApple needs to resolve the linkage to folders first. Hard links to directories are not supported in Time Machine, Apple will need to reprogram TM. I'm sure when they have Time Machine updated, they will make the change to APFS seamless. \n\nA: As of Big Sur, macOS now supports Time Machine backups to APFS formatted drives!  The TM backups with APFS are much faster than they were before.  Good luck!\nPer the macOS User Guide on Apple's website:\nAPFS or APFS Encrypted disks are the preferred format for a Time Machine backup disk. If you select a new backup disk that’s not already formatted as an APFS disk, you get the option to erase and reformat it. If the disk is a Mac OS Extended format disk that contains an existing Time Machine backup, you aren’t asked to erase and reformat the disk.\n\nA: According to Apple's web site:\n\nYou don't need to change any Time Machine\n  settings to back up APFS-formatted disks. Any Time Machine share\n  points must be shared over SMB instead of AFP.\n\nI wouldn't format your backup drive: it doesn't support APFS unless it is all flash. I would just try to do a Time Machine backup and let it worry about it. Since Time Machine backup are not image backups, I am assuming that the OS will handle the reading and writing of the backup records.\n", "Q: macOS Photos.app - Names Missing on Shared Albums Recently the names from users of my shared album have disappeared from the activity feeds (See picture) - this has only happened on the desktop, both the iPhone and iPad are fine.\nJust updated to High Sierra and hoped the issue would fix itself - but nope, still a problem. Any ideas? Searching for answers hasn't revealed anything.\n\n\nA: Please try these steps and report back:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Photos.app in your Mac go to Photos > Settings > iCloud and uncheck 'iCloud Photo Sharing'.\n\n*Wait about a minute for the changes to apply.\n\n*Quit Photos.app and restart your Mac.\n\n*Open Photos.app and turn on 'iCloud Photo Sharing'.\n", "Q: High Sierra won't install: for the boot disk it says: \"This disk cannot be used to start your computer\" I have a macbook pro late 2012, single stock SSD, Sierra installed with latest updates.

Afterwards first backup and then remove any additional partition after disk0s3 (but not a recovery partition) and any second logical volume and finally expand the CoreStorage LVG to the full size of either 512 or 768 GB (depends on your SSD).\n\nA: I had the problem described here on my MacBookPro12,1 (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running El Capitan, during attempts to upgrade to both High Sierra and Monterey.\nThis answer led me to gpt -r show disk0, which reported output similar to the output reported here, including Suspicious MBR at sector 0, and MBR rather than PMBR.\nThe accepted answer suggests using gdisk to replace the hybrid MBR with a legal protective MBR. Rather than installing gdisk on MacOS, I followed the advice in this answer and used the Ubuntu gdisk.\nAll of this seems consistent with the comments following the question, which suggest that this problem is more likely with dual booting.\nAfter the Ubuntu gdisk invocation, both Ubuntu and MacOS still booted successfully, and the Monterey installer accepted the MacOS partition as a target. Monterey is running now on that Mac, and Ubuntu still works also.\n\nA: I solved this by doing a full time machine backup, Booting recovery mode, bringing up diskutility there and reformating the disk.\nThen did a restore from time machine.\n", "Q: Failed to Upgrade from macOs High Sierra GM to Public Release I have a MPB with macOS 10.13 Beta (17A362a) (GM), when trying to install the public release from the App Store I get the following error:\n\nAn error occurred while preparing the installation.

Simply taking Tim to the office and using their network was enough to fix the issue.\n", "Q: How to prevent conversion to APFS on High Sierra install The current understanding seems to indicate that \"all SSD\" machines will have at least their main/root file system converted to APFS on the install of High Sierra.\nThat means HFS+ is still a viable boot file system (as it was during testing the beta on an external rotational drive). I want to keep HFS+ for now.\nHow do I force a full default install, including Recovery HD, onto an \"all SSD\" MacBook Pro that keeps HFS+ as the only file system?\n\nA: Read here how to do it with ....startosinstall....\nhttps://derflounder.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/using-the-macos-high-sierra-os-installers-startosinstall-tool-to-avoid-apfs-conversion/\nan easy solution, from a very experienced source.\n\nA: One method to prevent an automatic conversion when installing High Sierra is to redirect the install onto an external drive first. (Or a traditional HDD on larger desktop machines and laptops that were modified to have these drives in addition to SSDs.)\nFrom the external drive this installation can then be cloned back to the main internal boot drive (preferably after the boot drive is erased). Once the clone is back on an SSD the filesystem will stay at HFSplus.\nIf the goal of the whole procedure is a \"clean install\" anyway then this is less of a detour as it may seem. It might be actually faster in this way, if the options involve a slow USB-stick you have to prepare for this with createinstallmedia and then install from there vs. first installing onto a very fast external drive. [That same possible advantage may be desired when someone wants multiple machines to upgrade to High Sierra. See update2 below]\nNo external drives will currently be converted to APFS when installing macOS 10.13. \nNo-one really knows for how long this principle will hold true but currently this is the case for both kinds of drives: rotational magnetic and solid state drives.\nSince this is met with so much opinion, others suggest:\n\nSafest way to upgrade to macOS High Sierra without APFS\nThe way that I strongly suggest doing this is the safest and easiest. Safest because if something goes awry, the upgrade can be dropped without changing what you already have:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Clone the boot drive to any spare external drive.\n  \n*Boot off the spare/clone.   \n  \n*Upgrade the spare/clone. The updater will leave the file system alone—it won’t be converted to APFS.    \n  \n*Boot off the now updated spare/clone. Check things out and verify that things are working to your satisfaction—and don’t rush this. Make sure everything is acting right and that everything you normally do is OK as well.   \n  \n*Satisfied? Clone the now updated external to the original boot drive.\n  \n*Boot from the original boot drive (now updated).\n  \n  \n  By doing it this way, there is no change to the existing boot drive until you explicitly choose to clone back over it with the updated system.\n\n\nPlease note that a \"clean install\" is different from the in-place upgrade now often preferred by users: a clean install means that previous programs, settings and data should be erased (via formatting) before the new installation is cloned back and therefore have to be restored afterwards either manually or with Migration Assistant.\nWhile a clone of a fresh install may be performed similar like an upgrade – just on top of whatever is on your boot drive – this method is not advisable.  Formatting the internal boot drive before cloning back the new and fresh install ensures that the internal drive is in just the same \"really fresh install\" condition that is the primary goal of performing a \"clean install\".\n\nUpdate2: Upgrading multiple machines in this way is not recommended by Apple anymore, since firmware updates are now rolled into the installer. Unless we figure out how the firmware updates are to be applied manually. Although this issue seems to be more pressing with APFS installations than with HFS+ as outlined in the question. In case you do need  those firmware updates, you might check out Applying Mac firmware updates manually as well.\nThe clone route outlined above is currently only recommendable for upgrading a single machine (where a firmware upgrade will take place) or re-installing the operating system on machines that had the firmware updates coming with and in High Sierra already applied.\n\nThe clone route outlined above is currently the best option to install High Sierra onto a MacBook that should keep HFSplus as a filesystem –– under the condition that it has an empty and unformatted replacement drive as its only internal disk. The latest High Sierra installer does not work with the combination of options --converttoapfs and --volume. An attempt to redirect the install and keeping the older filesystem will result in the error \"crashed HelperTool\".\n\nA: It should work by exiting any High Sierra installer GUI and starting the install from the command line:\n/Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall --converttoapfs NO\n\nFurther install options can be obtained by using the --usage argument:\n\nArguments\n  --applicationpath, a path to copy of the OS installer application to start the install with.\n  --license, prints the user license agreement only.\n  --agreetolicense, agree to license the license you printed with --license.\n  --rebootdelay, how long to delay the reboot at the end of preparing. This delay is in seconds and has a maximum of 300 (5 minutes).\n  --pidtosignal, Specify a PID to which to send SIGUSR1 upon completion of the prepare phase. To bypass \"rebootdelay\" send SIGUSR1 back to startosinstall.\n  --converttoapfs, specify either YES or NO on if you wish to convert to APFS.\n  --installpackage, the path of a package to install after the OS installation is complete; this option can be specified multiple times.\n  --usage, prints this message.\n  --volume, path to the target volume.   \n\n\nSources report that the command (in the Beta version) doesn't do anything on the first execution  but on the second.\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra media installer I want to make a USB media installer for the new High Sierra release. I commonly use createinstallmedia or DiskMakerX but for this new release I just can't make it work (both).

You should have a fully functional Installer file for bootable USB drives or just copying to other systems whether they be offline, or you just don't want to download the installer over and over.\nI am currently in the lengthy process of creating a bootable USB drive to make a Coffee Lake i7 8700k Hackintosh build. I'm following this guide with the recommended motherboard. I'll try to update here with my success/ failure.\n\nA: First, it would appear that you have not downloaded a correct app from the App Store. The correct \"Install macOS High Sierra.app\" should be 5.18 GB.\nSecond, you are using the wrong syntax for the createinstallmedia command in the High Sierra installer. You now don't need the --applicationpath parameter. Check out this Apple support page.\n\nA: So, the guys from DiskMakerX gave me an answer to solve this problem.\n\nMany people (including yours truly) were sometimes getting an\n  installer application “stub” when downloading the Install macOS High\n  Sierra application from the App Store. This “stub” application did not\n  include the Contents/SharedSupport folder or its (very important)\n  contents. The needed resources were instead downloaded “on-the-fly”\n  when you ran the Install macOS High Sierra application.\nThis “stub” application is not useful as something to import into your\n  Munki repo, or to use with AutoDMG or autonbi, or similar things. For\n  these you really want the full installer, that is, one that contains\n  all the needed installation resources in Contents/SharedSupport.\nMany theories and ideas were put forth as to what caused one to get\n  the stub vs the full installer. While I’m still not 100% sure about\n  this, I think we’ve narrowed in on the cause.\nIt appears that when the App Store is downloading the installer app,\n  it also uses softwareupdate to get the resources that normally reside\n  in Contents/SharedSupport. If com.apple.SoftwareUpdate has been\n  configured to use a CatalogURL that points to a softwareupdate catalog\n  that does not contain product URLs for the needed Install macOS High\n  Sierra resources, you get the “stub” application instead.\nIf, however, softwareupdate is using either Apple’s default\n  CatalogURL, or is pointed to an internal CatalogURL that contains the\n  needed products, you get the full installer.\nCurrently, the needed resources are Product 091-34298, “Install macOS\n  High Sierra”, but this will almost certainly change over time.\nTL;DR: to get a full High Sierra installer from the App Store, make\n  sure softwareupdate is pointed at Apple’s softwareupdate servers or an\n  internal server in which you have synced and made available the\n  “Install macOS High Sierra” product.\n\nHere's the info if someone else is having the same issue.\nSome stuff about install macOS High Sierra.app\nAnd I found another solution... Install the latest OS updates from the App Store and after that you should get the full installer.\n\nA: Here is what worked for me on Yosemite.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that the HighSierra update was showing up under my updates in the Mac App Store. \n\n*https://i.imgur.com/qF03hOh.png\n1) Close the Mac App store app and then open up the terminal.\n2) Reset software update catalog\n$ sudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog\nsoftwareupdate: Changed catalog to Apple production\n\n\n\n*\n\n*--clear-catalog seems to reset the configuration and ensure that software update is pointing at the right place.  For some people, they report that just running this, rebooting and then trying through the Mac App Store again is enough to get the full download.  That didn't work for me however.\n\n\n3) List available updates to see if High Sierra shows up.\n$ sudo softwareupdate --list\nSoftware Update Tool\nCopyright 2002-2012 Apple Inc.\n\nFinding available software\nSoftware Update found the following new or updated software:\n   * Install macOS High Sierra-\n    macOS High Sierra ( ), 5106655K [recommended]\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If it doesn't show up...then this probably won't work for you.\n\n\n4) Download the update\n$ sudo softwareupdate -v -d 'Install macOS High Sierra- '\nSoftware Update Tool\nCopyright 2002-2012 Apple Inc.\n\nFinding available software\n\nDownloading macOS High Sierra\n   Progress: 1%\n   Progress: 2%\n   ...\n   Progress: 99%\n   Progress: 100%\nDownloaded macOS High Sierra\nDone.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The -v flag gives me download progress. \n\n*Because the update has spaces in the name it must be quoted. \n\n*There is a space at the end of the name...doesn't work without it...awesome right?

Just ls /Library/Updates/091-76348/*.dist to see what \"dist\" files you have.  (@chelder's comment)\nAfter the installer completes, you should see that the full High Sierra installer is now in your /Applications folder.\n$ ls -d -1 /Applications/Install*\n/Applications/Install macOS High Sierra.app\n\n...and it is the full 5GB\n$ du -h -d0 /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app\n4.9G    /Applications/Install macOS High Sierra.app\n\nBackground/References:\nThere are a few blog posts discussing this but there doesn't seem to be a conclusion why some people only get the \"stub\" (the 14-22MB file) and others get the full 5GB download.  To make a USB boot disk you need the full file.  The \"stub\" will work for normal (non clean installs) and downloads the necessary files on the fly.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://managingosx.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/stupid-install-macos-high-sierra-tricks/\n\n*https://managingosx.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/some-stuff-about-install-macos-high-sierra-app/\n\nA: It is indeed SharedSupport folder missing that causes this. In order to fix it, you should launch the small 'stub' installer, it will download all needed files to your home (/Users/username). You will need to cancel the installation after downloading ends of course.\nThen if you just move those files to 'stub' installer folder, like this for example:\nsudo mv /Users/username/macOS\\ Install\\ Data Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/SharedSupport\n\nand run createinstallmedia again, it will do what we want it to do.\n\nA: It can be quite challenging to get a full version of the High Sierra installer if you don't want to use third party scripts or untrusted sources. The official way is a download from MAS via the link on this page from Apple's KB but likely this only downloads the stub installer w/o the actual payload.\nIf you happen to have a Catalina machine around, there is now a second officially supported way to get it:\nsoftwareupdate --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version 10.13.6\n\nWith that the full installer is downloaded and placed in /Applications so you can directly use createinstallmedia with it.\n\nA: I am also facing this issue of the installer being 16 MB.

Internal disk is a plain hard disk drive; not an SSD. I downloaded macOS High Sierra (10.13) from the app store. Once it downloaded, I double-clicked the installer and let it do what it usually does as I have done in the past while doing major OS updates.\nI ran some errands and took a nap—this stuff takes time—and then when I check my system I see a message along the lines of “macOS cannot be installed on this system.” Strange. I reboot and I get the black startup screen with the Apple logo, but then after a moment or so the typical command line messages that come up with a kernel panic pop up. Then the OS goes the multi language “Your machine has crashed, press space to restart.” Okay, I do that… And then it does the same thing again: Kernel panic-like messages over the standard Apple screen saying no OS found and then the “press space” message.\nThis is baffling to me. I have no modded my system. This is a stock Mac mini with upgraded RAM. My external disks are just basic external USB 3.0 drives. Utterly nothing strange here. Why would this install fail this badly?\nFWIW, when I just rebooted into the macOS Sierra (10.12) external disk this is all I see on my main hard drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS Install Data\n\n*private\n\n*Recovered Items\n\n*Users\n\nFWIW, I have a MacBook Air (2013) running macOS 10.12 (Sierra) that is all SSD and has 4GB of RAM and you know what?

Upgraded that machine without issue.\n\nA: Sorry for the lack of specificity, but I finally was able to get macOS High Sierra (10.13) installed on my Mac mini (Late 2012; 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5) with 16GB of memory and an internal disk that is a plain hard disk drive; not an SSD.\n\n\n*\n\n*I reset the System Management Controller (SMC).\n\n*I reset the NVRAM.\n\n*I disconnected all USB peripherals—including a simple/small unpowered USB hub—except for a direct connection between keyboard and mouse and the system.\n\n*I then ran Onyx and cleaned all caches—“System” and “User”—before launching the “Install macOS High Sierra” installer.\n\n\nCrossed my fingers, let it do what it had to do and lo and behold… Everything went as expected!\nThe only hint of something I noticed before doing this—that might help someone—is I had a bootable USB backup of my main system disk attached during the last failed attempt to upgrade and—this is important—it didn’t seem like I had an explicitly selected startup disk set. The system seemed to just always default to my internal hard disk drive, but never explicitly had that set. I made sure to set that after I reset the SMC and NVRAM. Like I said, not 100% sure that is the cause but it is something to keep in mind.\n", "Q: How can I make the trackpad (not mouse) significantly faster? Context\nI run a three screen setup and it takes forever to get from side to side when using the trackpad even when set to max in settings. I'm looking for (and thought I had found) a solution that will allow me to set the trackpad tracking speed as arbitrarily high as I want.\nWhat I've Done So Far\nI've already tried the solution laid out here. The problem is that no matter how high I set the number when running defaults write -g com.apple.trackpad.scaling x the sensitivity still isn't high enough for me.\nAt first I thought this might mean that there is another limit imposed besides the one dictated by the GUI. Proceeding on this hypothesis (and the assumption that if Apple throttled the trackpad they would do the same to the mouse) I ran defaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling 1000 (note the 'mouse' instead of 'trackpad').\nResult: My mouse is now so sensitive that if my cursor happens to land where I intend I can only ascribe it to the will of God.\nRemaining Problem\nNo matter how high I set the number for the trackpad, one motion across its surface isn't enough to get from the left edge of my first monitor to the right edge of my third. Note: The goal here is not to set the trackpad speed and mouse speed separately (as in the question marked as duplicate). I simply wanted to indicate that the analogous steps that work for a mouse do not work for a trackpad. In addition, the selected answer in the duplicate provides a dead link (so not much help). \nThe goal is to be able to set the trackpad speed significantly faster than allowed by the GUI in settings. I'm open to downloading a third party tool, but would prefer a command line solution (or explanation as to why the one I've tried doesn't work as expected).\nI realize this is probably a pretty niche question, but your help is much appreciated.\n\nA: You can set higher speeds with BetterTouchTool by enabling Advanced Settings and choosing the General tab of the Trackpad settings.\n\n", "Q: How does Mac pause upgrade when close the lid? I'm upgrading macOS High Sierra. During upgrading, I close the lid for some time, then open the lid to see if upgrade finished. But when I open the lid, the system continue to upgrade from the progress I left. How does Mac do this?\nI mean it needs an operating system to control pause/resume, but the OS is under upgrading, how can it control the computer?\n\nA: This is managed by the System Management Controller (SMC).\nThe SMC is basically a chip in Intel-based Macs that manage many of the physical aspects of your Mac. This includes power buttons, LED indicators, cooling fans, how your Mac works in its various sleep modes, and so on.\nBecause the SMC is a sub-system of your Mac, it is not dependent on an operating system being installed.\nYou may be interested in reading Reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac - although there is no reason for you to reset the SMC as it did what it was supposed to do in your case.\n", "Q: How to safely dismiss the apple pay screen I like the apple pay feature. however there are times when the apple pay pops up even though I am not buying anything or even close to a shop.\nThe problem is that when the apple pay screen pops up, if I touch the touch id then it will end up making a payment.\nI want a sure shot way of safely dismissing the apple pay screen when it pops up without a reason.\nI am using iphone 8 plus with latest ios 11.\n\nA: Press the home button with a finger not registered with TouchID or press the On/Off button on the right side of the phone.

There are some real problems with not having ftp and telnet present in 10.13 now as per Apple's dictate.\nHas anyone found a solid way to bring BSD ftp and telnet back to macOS vs using inetutils?\n\nA: Apple's Telnet and FTP programs are back in High Sierra thanks to this homebrew pull request (by yours truly). Both the client and server of each one are back, and these are Apple's original versions of these programs.\ninetutils unfortunately exhibits some bugs on High Sierra so this will be a better solution and should make everyone happy.\nTo install ALL the formulas in that PR, run this at the command line:\nbrew install tnftp tnftpd telnet telnetd\n\n\nOf course you can install each of these separately as well:\n# TNFTP client & server (formerly known as LukeMFTP, presumably due to being developed by Luke Mewburn \n# and has been the default FTP for default FTP client included with NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, \n# Darwin (macOS), and MidnightBSD):\nbrew install tnftp \nbrew install tnftpd \n\n# Telnet client & server:\nbrew install telnet \nbrew install telnetd\n\n\nA: Using Homebrew:\nbrew install inetutils\n\nThis will restore telnet, ftp, etc...\nCan't believe Apple removed such a fundamental utilities from the command line.\n\nA: grab the binaries from a Sierra install /usr/bin ;)\n\nA: You could try grabbing libtelnet and lukemftp from the open source repository for macOS 10.12.6 and compiling them for yourself.  \nIf you use homebrew, BSD telnet is prepackaged and installable via brew install telnet.\n\nA: Telnet is include in the inetutils  port in MacPorts.

I first stripped all except the boot drive [Samsung SSD in the optical bay] & keyboard/mouse.

After doing that, it worked & all went smoothly after that. The OS update is actually a separate process, which I hadn't realised until that point.\n\nA: Okay, I got it.\nFirst, I installed Sierra an a USB drive and did all updates.\nThen I inserted the High Sierra USB drive and started the installer. And voila, I was able to press the shutdown button and did the EFI update!\n\nA: I noticed my EFI partition wouldn't mount using bless and figured it had somehow been corrupted (gave the \"invalid sector size\" error during mount), thus preventing the firmware update from happening. Also tried some random other tools involving the EFI were failing.\nBesides the prerequisites I already had (standard Apple-branded GPU, etc), I had to freshly reinstall Sierra onto a separate physical disk then run the HS installer to update the firmware.

I hear the boot up sound. Then nothing happens. The screen stays turned on even if I remove power and close the lid. Only pressing power button for a view seconds turns the MacBook completely off. Another interesting thing: when I let the MacBook stay in this black screen state for a while I start hearing the cooling ventilator running at low power which suggests that the MacBook is making use of its computational power but does not display anything)\nAny ideas what to do now?\n(of course I have a Time Machine backup on an external drive but I don't have an idea how to make use of it at this point)\nFurther information:\n\n\n*\n\n*The macOS partition was encrypted with FileVault and a modification:\nonly he root user can decrypt it\n\n*Also there was a Boot Camp partition with Windows 10\n\n*It seems like pressing Option key works and booting the Windows partition works!\n\n*When I press the Option key I can select between Windows and Macintosh HD. Menu works fine. The second I press Enter on the Macintosh HD it seems to freeze. So maybe it's related to the encryption?\n\n*I managed to boot into my time machine backup using the boot menu with connected backup drive. Using the Disk Utility I found a crazy fact: It seems like the macOS partition is gone. Not sure if this is normal (could be because Disk Utility can't read the encrypted partition?)\n\n\nA: Possible reason for the problem\nI am not 100% sure but my guess on why all this happened is the special way I set up my disk encryption. (For detail: I used normal File Fault encryption but because my standard user has a weak password I removed this user from the users who are able to decrypt and instead added a root user with a strong password who was able to decrypt the drive.)\nAs my research provided the the update to High Sierra changes the file system format from HPFS+ to the new standard called APFS. With a different encryption as well. My guess is that during the upgrade either the special root user was removed or another error occurred in connection to this constellation.\nHow I finally dealt with it\nAs written above I was able to boot in the recovery mode of the TimeMachine disk. But I had to realise that this time machine was running OSX El Capitan (obviously the running system of my Mac when I created the first backup) and El Capitan was of course not able to either decrypt or even identify the new APFS file system on my internal drive (which explains the missing partition in my picture).\nThe next try was (don't know why I didn't try this earlier) to boot in normal recovery mode by holding down CMD+R while booting. This worked and I was able to use the disk utility to delete the Macintosh HD partition, create a new one instead (as APFS) and the reinstall macOS High Sierra from the recovery menu.\nAfter the complete new installation finished I was asked if I want to move any data and I selected my Time Machine backup. It needed a few hours but after this my system is back on track. Everything seems and where I left it.\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*As general note for all of you who want to perform the upgrade: Back up your data immediately before doing it!\n\n*And after the update is done shut down the Mac once to check if everything is fine. (Don't wanna think about the scenario where I would have worked a few days without shutdown any new backup and then shut it down to end with this...)\n\n*After my described fix I had to set up the disk encryption again (now I only use my normal user and instead of any trick the account now has a strong password...)\nThanks for your help :)\n", "Q: How to fully disable auto-fill-mode in Aquamacs 3.3?

Any Time Machine share points must be shared\n  over SMB instead of AFP.\n\nSource: Apple.com\nThis applies to Apple’s TimeCapsules as well. They are just network attached hard drives with Wi-Fi routers made by Apple.\n\nA: Having an APFS-formatted system backed up to an HFS+ Time Machine/Time Capsule disk is actually the currently intended use case.  The current version of Time Machine supports APFS only as a source disk, not as a destination.  In fact, if you format your Time Machine backup disk to APFS, Time Machine will re-format it back to HFS+ before using that disk.  This was discussed in WWDC 2016, and appears to still be true.\nAPFS does not support directory hardlinks, a feature of the filesystem used by Time Machine.  Until Time Machine is rebuilt to take advantage of APFS features (like snapshots) instead of hard links, APFS won't be usable as a destination disk.\nAlso, I personally just backed up my APFS laptop to my usual HFS+ backup disk via Time Machine, so there is some empirical validation.\n", "Q: Fastboot error on high Sierra I'm having problems using ´fastboot´ in high sierra.\nWhen I run the command:\nfastboot devices\n\nit tells me:\nERROR: Unable to create a plug-in (e00002be)\n\nNow, I've googled a lot and a lot of different users seems to have this issue, since Mountain Lion.\nI've tried rebooting my machine, unplugging and plugging again my phone and running it as superuser, but no luck.\nWhat can it be?\n\nA: found this on the SDK site\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/64292422\nUpdated SDK found here\nhttps://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html\nhope this helps.\n\nA: There's a problem with the fastboot application for OSX in the Android Platform Tools.

problem was that I erased the disk and created an AFPS partition. Apparently, this only creates a container, in which the actual partition must be added. I deleted the containers using the diskutil afps commands and then erased the disk by creating a new HFS+ partition.\nIn summary, if you want to install High Sierra from scratch, boot from the installation USB drive, start Disk Utility and erase/format your target drive with GUID/HFS+ (the previous default). The installer will then automatically convert it to APFS during the installation process.\n", "Q: High Sierra - The path /System/Installation/Packages/OSInstall.mpkg appears to be missing or damaged Got the following error \n\nThe path /System/Installation/Packages/OSInstall.mpkg appears to be\n  missing or damaged\n\nwhile upgrading Mac Mini (Late 2012) to High Sierra.

I hadn't noticed that the drive was nearly full before the update started, but during the install process the HD maxed out and then became unmoutable or mountable, and not recognized. Fortunately it was backed up but there should be a check on available disk capacity before starting the install process. In any event, here was my fix:\nStart the Mac in recovery mode - Command-Option-R\nOpen Terminal\nGet a list of volumes by:  \n\n$ diskutil list\n\nNote the HD reference (mine was disk0s2)\nkill fsck:\n\n$ ps -ax | grep fsck    (to get the process number)  \n$ kill \n\nErase the volume\n\n$ diskutil eraseVolume JHFS+ MyVolumeName /dev/disk0s2\n\nThen install the update as a new install\n\nA: I had this problem installing the latest macOS update.

Then just select your Macintosh HD (or how you named the volume when you installed macOS).\nThis weird boot thing happened after I ran an update on High Sierra.\n\nIf this doesn't resolve the issue, you could try the chosen answer.\n\nIt could be that your problem the problems on your Mac are worse. Then I would suggest to backup all your data in safe mode (or from a terminal in recovery mode) and do a clean install of macOS from a USB stick or from internet recovery.\n\nA: Same error happened to me when I received an update from 10.13.1 to 10.13.2.\nIf you boot with shift button pressed, you will be able to enter safe mode and try to download and reinstall an update.\nIt did not help to me so I booted holding Option key and chosen regular Mac HD (not an update volume). Booted to my Mac without safe mode and tried to reinstall this update. Somehow it worked out in several reboots.\n\nA: The easiest solution is the one by commenter Michael Buen. It has worked on 20 Macs I've seen have this issue.\nApple Menu -> Select Startup Disk -> Restart (after clicking your boot drive) resolves the issue, at least temporarily. This can be done at the error screen, by clicking on some empty space in the grey message box to get the apple menu bar to appear. You can also get to this \"Select Startup Disk\" menu option by starting up the Mac in recovery mode (cmd+r) or internet recovery (cmd+optn+r). If you use FileVault encryption, you'll need to enter your user password to unlock the drive.\nRe-installing MacOS on top if itself also solves the problem, but takes more time.  Internet Recovery (cmd+optn+r) and a MacOS bootable USB installer disk both work and  in theory do not delete any personal data.\nI've seen it recur more than once on the same computer. Updating to the latest point update for High Sierra (10.3.3 Supplemental) might be advisable, but does not guarantee a resolution.\n\nA: This is what worked for me, based off of this post: https://medium.com/@aeronode/how-i-fixed-my-non-booting-macos-high-sierra-installation-45d238b78c3d\nRestart in recovery mode (Cmd-R), Utilities -> Terminal\nfind / -name OSInstall.mpkg # Will be found somewhere in a tmp directory\nmkdir -p \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/System/Installation/Packages\"\ncp \"<OSInstall.mpkg path>\" \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/System/Installation/Packages/\"\nreboot\n\n\nA: I had the same error - turned out to be a disk space error. Opened up terminal from the recovery screen where it was asking me to reboot and cleared out several gigs of VMs and it worked after a reboot. I went ~15GB of free space to around 50GB, hope that helps someone else!\n\nA: Encountered the same error. Created an ISO image  of the OS High Sierra on USB and did the installation successfully.\n\nA: The CommandOptionR Operation (Internet Recovery Mode) seems to have worked for me. I chose to reinstall OS High Sierra on my mini mac, my MacBook Pro non Retina late 2012 as well as my MacBook Air and the upgrade completed without any issues...\n\nA: I got into the same problem and it was extreme  frustrating as no matter how many time I download, it could not just boot up. So how I solved my problem and install Mac High Sierra? Well what you need to do is to create a bootable usb then install the Mac High Sierra on the disk. That way you will have clean copy of Mac OS.  \n\nA: First boot to the recovery partition open terminal and type csrutil disable, then restart your Mac and hold CMD+S till you see plain text. Now plug in another pendrive and then press enter. Now find the pen drive disk identifier by typing ls -la /Dev/disk*. Then type mkdir usb. Then type mount - t [filesystem of  pendrive] /Dev/diskX /usb.  Then hit enter then type rsync -p -o [path to the file you want to backup] /usb\nTip: You can find the files listed in a specific directory by typing ls -la [path to directory]\nEg.ls -la /Users/home-directoryname/Desktop\nAfter the process is complete you can check if the files are there on your pendrive by typing ls -la /usb\nThen type reboot Then once you hear the startup chime hold CMD+R then open terminal and type csrutil enable\n\nA: I have faced up the issue yesterday, the solution was the same above, that was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount High Sierra's install\n\n*Check /Volume/InstallESD/Packages/ to find OSInstall.mpkg\n\n*cp \"<OSInstall.mpkg path>\" \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/System/Installation/Packages/\"\n\n*Reboot\n\n", "Q: How to create a custom keyboard shortcut for this nested menu item? I know how to create a shortcut; it is described on Apple website here. However, I came across a tricky case: I want to create a shortcut for the TextEdit application, particularly for setting the writing direction to Right to Left. The hierarchy for this is shown below:\n\nI think that the problem is with the Paragraph word written in grey.\nI've tried\nFormat->Text->Writing Direction->Right to Left\n\nand\nFormat->Text->Writing Direction->Paragraph->Right to Left\n\nand others, but none have worked.\nHow can I solve this issue? \n\nA: It doesn't matter that it's a command on a nested menu. Just create a proper entry, and in this case for the Right to Left command under Paragraph, it's:\n'   Right to Left'\n\nWithout the single quotes and that's a leading tab space in front of Right to Left.\nNote: You will need to copy and paste the '    Right to Left' (without the quotes from a text source other then this answer because AD converts tab characters to space characters), as you cannot key press a tab when creating the entry.\nHere are some screenshots from my system:\n\n\nNote: For the Right to Left command under Selection there are two leading tab spaces, e.g. (without the quotes):\n'       Right to Left'\n\nThe quotes in both examples are there to show there is leading tab space in front of the actual command names, although note that AD converts tab characters to space characters in these examples. \n", "Q: Do files on USB drive leave any trace on iMac (macOS Sierra)? I'd like to know if I look at files (specifically jpegs) stored on a usb drive without opening them, will they leave a trace on the iMac I'm putting the USB into? \nBascially, if I plug in a USB and don't actually open the jpeg files (eg. using preview) but only look at them as thumbnails in the finder folder, will they still leave a trace on the computer? \nAlso, if I move the jpeg files from one folder to another on the same USB drive, or from one usb drive to a different one (both plugged into the same iMac), does that also leave any trace on the computer?\nI want to know if anyone else accessing the computer will be able to see any trace of the jpeg files after I've removed the thumb drives. And if so, is there a  way to delete it?\n\nA: If you open a folder with files residing on an external drive, thumbnails will be created on the boot drive depending on the file type and the installed QuickLook plugins.\nThe previews, metadata and file paths are stored in SQLite database files deep inside the var folder in the com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache folder. The path to this folder contains arbitrary folder names.\nWith the proper commands the preview pics can be extracted from the database.\n\nTo remove the pic previews and other data you would have to delete the content of the folder.\nRelated links: \n\n\n*\n\n*View thumbnail cache in OS X\n\n*Collecting Quick Look Data From a Live macOS System\n", "Q: Font Smoothing PDF text in High Sierra macOS High Sierra appears to treat font smoothing and antialiasing differently in PDF documents in Preview. Text is more blurry and less crisp. \nI turned off \"Use LCD Font Smoothing When Available\" in the System Preferences with no difference.\nIs it possible to revert to the way macOS Sierra used to handle PDF text? \n\nA: There seem to be different issues at work here (judging by the comments.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Preview is getting buggier. Using an alternative way to display PDFs might be the only option to get a proper display of text, at least for now. Sometimes just using QuickLook will get you better results than Preview.app. To get around this \"fubar'ed bugginess\", some even go to lengths: \"opening the same PDF in the Snow Leopard VM (running on Sierra) is actually the fastest of the three! What did Apple do to the Preview app in Sierra?\"\n\n*When scrolling macOS now uses an intermediate rendering to conserve CPU cycles that gets updated to its final representation only when no more scrolling action occurs. That behaviour started at least in Sierra and actually that got a bit better (quicker, less noticeable) in High Sierra. \n\n*Also already in Sierra the default FontSmoothing settings were altered to a different default. That should not have changed in High Sierra (new OS bugs excluded). If the font display is not to your liking then there are the two checkbox settings in System Preferences to play with. \n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n*\n\n*Issue No.1 will only be fixed by faith and prayer and hope in a better future.\n\n*Issue No.2 usually should 'fix' itself, once scrolling stops (you may to to release the touch from any touchpad you might use). In all those numerous instances that it doesn't: file more bug-reports (= not with the Feedback.app) (The example in the comments trigger a bug retained from Sierra: slightly substandard PDFs that were assembled including graphics or PDF-files with suboptimal page attributes; might be fixed by reflowing the PDF; has to be done for every PDF triggering that bug, upgrading from Siera-Preview to Adobe Reader is one way to spare the hassle, downgrading to Yosemite the other.) Once the blurriness-stays-after-scrolling-bug is triggered your only workaround option is to quit Preview (really quit: check in Activity Monitor that the process is actually gone) and work with another PDF or use a different Reader.\n\n*Issue No. 3 lists the options you have to customise the settings to your liking. If both options from System Preferences are unsatisfactory you might get a more fine grained control with entering the following in Terminal.app:\ndefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2\nWhere y might experiment with the values for int between 0 and 3. The higher the number the more smoothing (some call it blurring) should be applied.  \n\n", "Q: Problem with sending pictures to icloud I have icloud which is almost empty, because my phone does not send pictures to icloud. It has sent only 88 pictures and rest of them are in the phone, and I cannot take pictures anymore because I dont have place. Why?\n\nA: on your iPhone go to settings and tap the top button with your name. On the screen that comes up tap icloud. On next screen tap Photos. On that screen make sure 'iCloud Photo library' is on and make sure 'Optimize iPhone Storage' is checked. Then wait awhile as photos are moved to icloud.\n", "Q: Does macOS High Sierra 10.13's EFI firmware check cause problems for MacPro3,1 2008 installations? Apparently there is a new eficheck routine that runs on macOS High Sierra that detects if your Mac is consistent with a database of known good firmware signatures. Though it appears to just report a warning with the offer to send the information to Apple, it does raise concerns about whether or not a MacPro3,1 or MacPro4,1 are going to be prevented from running High Sierra as a result.\nYes, I'm aware that a MacPro4,1 can be flashed to 5,1 to make it officially supported. For the 3,1 I've read that so far it will work as long as you have done the Bluetooth and WiFi upgrade and hacked the installer's plist to recognize the 3,1's motherboard. While the 5,1 might pass, I'm imagining that the 3,1's firmware would definitely be absent from a known list of good images.\nIs this a blocker or just an annoyance?\n\nA: Short answer: No, there's nothing you need to worry about eficheck. \nFirst of: eficheck is not a blocker, at least in its current state. Also I wouldn't call it an annoyance as it's supposed to be a security feature on supported system and the prompt it generates only appears once and remembers your decision whether or not you want to send data about your EFI to Apple.\nComing back to your question, eficheck shouldn't affect your system in anyway. I'm currently running High Sierra on my MacBook5,1 patched with the High Sierra Patcher Tool and it runs fine. Executing eficheck manually from the Terminal just throws the following error:\nReadBinaryFromKernel: No matching services found. Either this system is not supported by eficheck, or you need to re-load the kext\nIntegrityCheck: couldn't get EFI contents from kext\n\nMeaning the tool cannot read the EFI anyway. \nI guess the same would apply to your MacPro3,1, I'm not entirely sure though. But even assuming it does, it wouldn't block anything and I doubt it would prompt you the message because your EFI firmware likely isn't modified anyway. And even if eficheck gets triggered for some reason: you could just click the prompt away once and it never comes back again.\n", "Q: Is it safe to remove APFS containers? I have upgraded my Mac to High Sierra. So I was just looking at the features when I saw APFS container in Disk Utility. I googled it and found out that it is used for multiple logical drives but I thought I don't require it so is it safe to delete the containers?\nPS. I would also like to know the other features of APFS containers.\nOutput of diskutil apfs list:\nAPFS Container (1 found)\n|\n+-< Container disk1 2EE47F12-9699-433D-AECF-167CB27FDDF0\n    ====================================================\n    APFS Container Reference:     disk1\n    Capacity Ceiling (Size):      121123069952 B (121.1 GB)\n    Capacity In Use By Volumes:   39590055936 B (39.6 GB) (32.7% used)\n    Capacity Available:           81533014016 B (81.5 GB) (67.3% free)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Store disk0s2 7E9192B8-7976-4CBF-AE7C-C7B9D5E49F65\n    |   -----------------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Physical Store Disk:   disk0s2\n    |   Size:                       121123069952 B (121.1 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s1 578EF44C-A052-3F3F-BBE4-B254D82C57F2\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s1 (No specific role)\n    |   Name:                      Macintosh HD (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               /\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         37848293376 B (37.8 GB)\n    |   Encrypted:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s2 2DC1D14B-7E91-4F17-83CE-40E5435303FE\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s2 (Preboot)\n    |   Name:                      Preboot (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         21651456 B (21.7 MB)\n    |   Encrypted:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s3 3C4A7A25-7E07-48EC-B942-4DA9007D1538\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s3 (Recovery)\n    |   Name:                      Recovery (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         519995392 B (520.0 MB)\n    |   Encrypted:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s4 57093D4B-CDF1-4286-BC5C-6ED2DB620DD1\n        ---------------------------------------------------\n        APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s4 (VM)\n        Name:                      VM (Case-insensitive)\n        Mount Point:               /private/var/vm\n        Capacity Consumed:         1073762304 B (1.1 GB)\n        Encrypted:                 No\n\n\nA: TL;DR: To do a perfect clean wipe and reinstall in APFS now you need the terminal in recovery in addition to Disk Utility. It has to do with the container which is the new base volume scheme in APFS. \nFor your information, I upgraded my 2017 MBP to High Sierra since beta 9, and decided to clean wipe and reinstall immediately afterwards (makes me feel better reassured with all the APFS conversion). I checked the output \ndiskutil apfs list\n\nboth before and after, and realized how my recovery volume inside the new APFS container has grown in size from ~500 MB to 1.1 GB.\nNot letting that go, I did another clean install when the GM candidate arrived and sure enough the recovery has grown by another ~500 MB to 1.6GB. Not that this is likely going to happen to you but disk space is still disk space - Macintosh HD actually shrinks even under the shared volume scheme. With the arithmetic progression I'm pretty sure the recovery volume is not being overwritten but rather added upon every clean install. \nAfter some time figuring how some of the things now work in APFS I found the caveat. When I wipe my disk through Disk Utility within recovery I can only wipe the Macintosh HD volume that sits within the \nContainer disk1\n\nbut not the container or the disk itself like we've been doing pre-APFS. Even when you show all volumes in Disk Utility you'll get an error message if you do that. So the other 3 volumes (Preboot, Recovery, VM) are untouched - I was just doing a somewhat \"unclean wipe\". \nThe workaround is, with APFS now we have to open up terminal under utilities in recovery, then do\ndiskutil apfs deleteContainer disk0s2\n\nassuming your container is linked there. Now it will create a single empty volume named \"Untitled\" under your physical disk media as shown in Disk Utility. \nWe're not done yet - you have to go to that disk, e.g. \"APPLE SSD...\", then click erase in APFS format named Macintosh HD (or any name you wish), in order to set up the correct APFS container structure ready for you to install the OS back in place. The other 3 volumes sharing the container will not be there yet, but fear not, they will be automatically created when you install the OS.\n\nA: It's not safe to remove your container - but it shouldn't work anyway.\nThe container disk1 with the physical base disk0s2 contains your boot partition (disk1s1), the recovery partition (disk1s3), a partition with the virtual memory file(s) (disk1s4) and the preboot partition (disk1s2).\n", "Q: Larger resolution than proposed in El Capitan Is it possible to get a larger resolution on my Macbook Pro than the one proposed in System Preferences ?

This morning I tried to use scp to copy a single large file from my old Linux Ubuntu machine to my brand new 2017 Mac Book Pro. I ran into a very strange problem: scp would happily copy 95% of data (around 150 MB/sec) - to then \"stall\", and at some point tell me about broken connection. Afterwards, I basically had no more LAN access.\nThis happened on MacOs Sierra. What could be the reason?\n\nA: Turns out: the culprit was neither the Mac itself, nor my Linux box.\nI later found that the LogiLink USB-C to Ethernet adapter caused this. \nAnd for the record - there were various other symptoms, such as: \n\n\n*\n\n*download of large files in my browser being extra slow\n\n*replicating large files via IBM Notes not only being slow, but basically turning the whole machine into \"almost unresponsive\" mode\n\n", "Q: Repeated crashes of Photos app due to signal: Bus error: 10 I'm not sure if I'm the only one but every time I click 'Edit' on a photo that has already been edited by the previous version of Photos, it just crashes.

I logged in as a local admin, created a new local account, logged in to that account, connected to AD subnet (since I’m remote) via the VPN (which took some doing to get my VPN profile in this temp’ user account), then once connected, I did fast user switching to my domain account, and it worked. I rebooted to test it and was able to log straight in again afterward. I was momnetarily panicked that I’d orphaned my account, or would need to fly to SFO to be on the LAN for all of 3 minutes to solve this, but in the end was able to solve this with only a couple hours of downtime. I then removed the temp’ user and am whole again. Cheers. \n\nA: The solution is simple, IF you have another user account set up.

Per this article I downloaded the 10.12.6 versions of Sierra's pkg and pfpkg files. I cannot use the technique described in the article because Sierra is no longer available in the App Store. Is there a way to use these files to upgrade my MBP without the App Store?\n\nA: Only if you know the exact location of the files for 10.12.6, the last available version.\nFrom your link...\n\nUpdate: Here, we have mentioned the URL of the package file for macOS\n  10.12. If the latest version of macOS Sierra available on the Mac App Store is a different one, MAS will fetch it from a different location.\n  Hence the workaround mentioned here will not work, unless you know the\n  URL of the latest package file and create the directory structure on\n  localhost based on the same.\n\nIt's always wisest to download any major new version from the App Store - any time between when it's released & when it's taken down - even if you never install it. That way it will always be in your purchase history & you can get it again at any time.\n\nA: Why not ask a friend that has Sierra in his Purchased list, to download it, and give you the installer file that comes in his Applications folder. You can use that to install Sierra.\n", "Q: Stop auto scroll down in OS X terminal Is there a way to temporarily stop the terminal from automatically scrolling down when new output is output to the terminal?  \n\nA: You can pipe your command into more or less.  du -h | less\nThis gives you a page at a time.\n\nA: Just scroll a line or two upward.

So I cloned my boot drive to another partition, and upgraded to Sierra on it.  For the most part everything is fine, but there's an issue with Mail.app that is really frustrating me.\nIn Mail I have rules, based on the send address from different people/places, that move those emails into specific folders (mailboxes, in Mail terminology).  For instance emails from my bank go into my \"Finance\" mailbox.\nThen I have a separate smart mailbox labeled \"Finance\" with a single rule - \"Messages is in mailbox 'Finance'\".  This allows me to organize all my different frequently used mailboxes into one area \"Smart Mailboxes\" which I can move to the top of the sidebar for ease of access.\nIn Mavericks, this works great and I have a couple of mailboxes set up this same way.  But in Sierra, this doesn't work at all.  The rules work fine for moving the emails into the separate folder/mailbox, but the smart mailbox rule fails to save.  I can set it as desired, but on subsequent editing it will always read \"Message is in mailbox 'No mailbox selected'\" and therefore will show me all emails in my inbox, rather than just those in the Finance mailbox.\nThe issue appears to only be with using mailboxes that are in my iCloud account.  I can select a folder in a Gmail or self-hosted mailbox for example, and the Smart Mailbox rule works fine.\nWhy does this work fine in Mavericks but not Sierra, and how can I get it to work once more?  I have already tried a Rebuild but it did nothing.\n\nA: OK, I can't explain why this happened, but this issue appears to be fixed.  I was trying to resolve a different issue (Gmail emails going to Recovered Messages for unknown reasons), so I deleted my Gmail account from the Internet Accounts in System Preferences.  Then I quit & relaunched Mail, and in Mail Prefs I added the GMail account back again.\nSuddenly, both the Gmail problem I was trying to solve, AND this Smart Mailboxes issue, were fixed!  I don't know what the actual problem was, but for whatever reason this appears to have solved it.  I'll accept the answer after I've lived with this a day or two and it stays fixed.  So weird...\n\nA: I had a similar problem and I found a solution here luckily after searching like crazy. The problem was, that I used my Gmail account as my Apple Id, so mail got confused. After I deactivated mail in my iCloud account settings, it was working fine. This is obviously only a solution if you don't use both accounts. Anyway, maybe it helps someone:\n\nAnd here's the solution, or rather the explanation for the problem: If\n  you're using your gmail Adress as your apple-id (and therefore as your\n  login credentials for your iCloud account) Apple Mail seems to get\n  confused. Simply change your iCloud Username to something else and\n  your good to go.\n\n\nA: I had similar problems with all my email accounts that were \"feeded\" in when doing a fresh install from the iCloud-sync-mechanism.\nThe solution as stated above:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit mail\n\n*Remove IMAP-account from \"System Preference\" > \"Internet Account\".\n\n*Open mail\n\n*Add account manually in mail.app.\n\n*Profit.\n\n", "Q: Using PRIMARY clipboard in macOS I use Linux (CentOS) at work and quite like the PRIMARY clipboard. This adds highlighted text to a clipboard automatically and pastes the contents of that clipboard on center-button mouse click.

I have tried MacPaste, but this overwrites the CLIPBOARD clipboard. Does there exist any utility (graphical or command-line, free or paid) that unlocks this functionality? \n\nA: According to OSX Daily, there is an alternative clipboard with the Mac that will not overwrite the standard clipboard. The commands are Control-k, which does a cut on selected text (not copy) and Control-y which then pastes that data. The article is here: http://osxdaily.com/2012/02/01/use-a-secondary-cut-and-paste-function-to-avoid-overwriting-clipboard-contents/\nThe article also mentions a 3rd part app, ClipMenu which also might address your desires.\n", "Q: What tools are available to help organize iOS apps into folders? It used to be the case that we could organize iOS apps on iPhones and iPads by connecting them to a Mac and using some functionality in iTunes.  But with recent changes to iTunes, this is no longer possible.  If you have an iOS device with many apps on many home screens it is now more difficult to organize these apps into folders (by dragging the apps across many home screens).  Can anyone recommend an easier way to accomplish this, including, perhaps, some third-party software that runs on a Mac?\n\nA: You can use Apple Configurator 2, available on the MAS. It's intended as an enterprise tool for those managing lots of iDevices, but works just as well for one. It's fairly self explanatory and graphical in use.\nSelect your device, then from the menu bar: Actions | Modify | Home Screen Layout. There you can drag Apps about.

The full story: I have a clone of my old MBP drive which had Yosemite installed. I now have a new MBP with macOS Sierra on it. I tried to transfer the data from my old Mac to the new one using Migration Assistant, but it froze while importing the Applications. I also tried importing just my user account, but it was so slow that I cancelled the procedure, and decided to use Carbon Copy Cloner to finish the work. CCC had problems with permissions on some folders in my ~/Library folder however, and it did not seem to succeed importing everything. Now, my question is three-fold:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will I have more luck if I restore my ~/Library folder from a Time Machine backup? Or will it also have the same permission problems?\n\n*My Time Machine backup is from a Yosemite installation. If I restore my ~/Library folder from that backup on a macOS Sierra machine, will I run into troubles? I am thinking about settings that might be specific to macOS Sierra here that I would be loosing by overwriting my ~/Library folder.\n\n*Will it work to restore my ~/Library folder from Time Machine while I am logged in? I mean, won't some of these files be in use and impossible to overwrite?\n\n\nA: Have you done anything on the Sierra install that you wouldn't want overwritten? I've never tried restoring between different versions myself, but my guess is that it wouldn't be an issue—it'd just upgrade everything it needed to when you next logged in.\nAs for doing it while you are logged in—I wouldn't try it. I would either log in under a different administrator account, if you have one (but this might result in permissions problems), or log out, then borrow someone else's machine and log in over SSH. That way you won't have background processes writing stuff to your Library folder as you're trying to copy it.\n\nThis is for Time Machine. It may not restore everything—see below!\n\n\n*\n\n*Borrow a friend's Mac (sorry, but Windows machines won't work) and open Terminal.\n\n\nIf your backup drive is locked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your backup drive and unlock it if necessary.\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n*See below, starting with the ssh command, and replace ~/Library with /Volumes/disk/Backups.backupdb/machine-name/Latest/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/user/Library where disk is the name of the backup disk, machine-name is the name of the old machine, and user is your username, as in the SSH command. Any spaces will have to be preceded with backslashes, as with \"Macintosh\\ HD\". You can hit Tab while typing a path segment and it will autocomplete it for you, including escaping things as necessary (the backslash thing). Stop before the chmod command, as you didn't do anything to your friend's Library folder and don't need to undo it. (Plus, if for some reason they wanted something in their Library folder to be read-only, they might get mad at you!)\n\n\nIf your backup drive is not locked (hopefully it is, but just in case):\n\n\n*\n\n*Do the same thing as above, except connect the backup drive to the new machine (without logging in!) and remove the user@machine.local: bit from the transfer. Also do the transfer while still logged in to the remote machine. You can then also use ~ in place of /Users/user (but don't replace this with /Volumes/...). The above method works just fine, but this one is faster.\n\n\n\nAn important note!\nI'm not completely sure about this, but Time Machine may not back up everything in ~/Library. If you find something missing and still have the old machine around, I would use that to transfer the files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up both machines and connect them to the same network. Do not log in on the new machine, or log out if you are logged in.\n\n*Log into the old machine, and open Terminal.\n\n*Type chmod -R -w ~/Library. This will prevent the old system from modifying the folder as you're copying it. From here on out, until you undo this with chmod -R +w ~/Library, preferences will not be saved. Some other things might not be saved either; it's just a good idea not to do any work on either machine while this is going on.\n\n*Type ssh user@machine.local, where user is your username on the new machine (the name of your home folder, not your full name), machine is your new machine name, and local is the TLD of your local network. It may be local (mine is), but may also be something else. It might say something to the effect of \"authenticity cannot be verified\", but if you're on a home network you probably don't have to worry about this. You'll need to enter your login password (for the new machine) when it asks you.\n\n\n*\n\n*You are now logged in to the remote machine. Type mv ~/Library ~/.Trash/Library to trash the folder you're about to replace.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have enough disk space to keep the old version around, you can use rm -rv ~/Library instead. Be very careful with rm, however! It deletes files immediately, without asking for confirmation. I wouldn't recommend doing this unless absolutely necessary, as then you won't be able to restore if there's a problem.\n\n\n*Type ⌃D to log out of the remote system. If that doesn't work (although it should), use exit.\n\n\n*Type rsync -rlptgDEHP --stats ~/Library user@machine.local:/Users/user/Library, substituting as above. This is the actual copy; it will most likely take a very long time. If you need to stop, just hit ⌃C to cancel the transfer. When you pick up again, it will have to go through the \"building file list\" process all over again but the actual sending process should pick up where you left off.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can add z to the -rlptgDEHP bit if you have a slow local network (which is kind of unlikely, but...). This will make rsync compress everything before sending it across the network, although it'll take time to compress it before sending it and decompress it at the other end.\n\n\n*After the transfer is complete and you've tested it to make sure nothing broke, type chmod -R +w ~/Library (on the local machine). This will make it writable again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit: You should do this on the new machine as well, so you'll be able to save preferences and things there.\n\n\n\n\nA small note about security (this shouldn't really matter at home, but it might elsewhere):\nRsync uses a remote-shell program for the transfer; if the remote-shell program isn't secure, I doubt the transfer would be. It should use SSH, which is secure, but according to the manual, it can be configured to use something else:\n\nFor remote transfers, a modern rsync uses ssh for its communications, but it may have been configured to use a different remote shell by default, such as rsh or remsh.\nYou can also specify any remote shell you like, either by using the -e command line option, or by setting the RSYNC_RSH environment variable.\n\nSo if you want to force it to use SSH, use RSYNC_RSH='ssh' rsync ...\nThis only matters for network connections; it doesn't matter with the \"TM drive not locked\" method, as SSH is definitely used there.\n", "Q: How to open an image file from bash in Mac? I am fairly new with a Mac (Mac from work), and get more and more disappointed. Now I am blocked again, because I did not find an EASY way to open an image from the command line...\nHere is how it works in Linux (simple, no installation required):\neog test.jpg\n\nHow to achieve the similar thing on a Mac? \n\nA: open test.jpg will open the image in the default application for JPEG files (on most Macs this will be Preview) and open -a Pixelmator test.jpg will open in the app Pixelmator if you have it installed. Obviously Pixelmator can be replaced with any application that can open the file.\nThe open command is quite powerful, it allows for opening files, directories and even URLs. I suggest you read the man page.\n\nA: If you only want to preview the file, I recommend to use Quicklook. \nqlmanage -p filename.jpg\nThis will launch a Quick Look window with whatever file is specified as ‘filename.jpg’, the file type can be anything that Quick Look is compatible with (which seems to be just about everything).\nSource: OS X Daily\n", "Q: What determines whether a drive can be converted to APFS? Now High Sierra is released and not in beta, I'm wondering what the rules are about covering drives to APFS.\nThe release version of High Sierra auto converts SSDs to APFS on installation. But we know that Apple pulled the conversion of Fusion drives during the beta. We also know that non-fusion spinning disks can be converted to APFS but are not auto-converted. \nAccording to the developer advice and several internet sources, other drives can be converted by using Disk Utility (right click the disk and the option will be greyed out if not available). \nSo I thought I'd try this on an old (late 2009) 27\" iMac and the option was not available (the internal disk is actually new this year so it isn't just age). My Macbook Pro (early 2015) internal SSD converted automatically. Then I have some external disks all of which are perfectly functional. So I tried some of them. My Time Machine external disk would convert (not sure whether it is worth it) and old spinning 500GB spinning disk (extracted from an old MacBook) will convert. But two other disks (a LaCie 2GB USB and the original 1GB from my iMac) will not.\nSo what are the rules? Which disks can be converted to APFS? It is clearly more complicated that Apple's guidance which implies any HFS+ drive can be converted. Is it a settings thing we can manually alter, or is it a hardware thing we can't fix?\n\nA: There's an important distinction that needs to be made that's key to understanding the \"rules.\"  There's:\n\n*\n\n*Supporting APFS\n\n*Converting to APFS\n\nAny drive, spinning (HDD) or solid state (SSD) will support APFS. You can wipe it clean and do a new partition with an APFS volume.\nApple File System Guide FAQ:\n\nCan I use Apple File System with my existing hard disk drive?\nYes. Apple File System is optimized for Flash/SSD storage, but can also be used with traditional hard disk drives (HDD) and external, direct-attached storage.\n\nParaphrased from the FAQ:\n\nApple File System is a new, modern file system for...macOS....It is\noptimized for Flash/SSD storage...\nAPFS replaces HFS+ as the default file system for...macOS High Sierra and later.\n\nConverting (during install or otherwise) is another story.\n\n*\n\n*Installs/Upgrades with an SSD will convert automatically.\n\n*Installs/Upgrades with an HDD will not.\n\n*You cannot convert non-Mac volumes at all. Though you can erase the drive and do a fresh install with APFS.\n\nSo as a use case, you install macOS High Sierra on a iMac with a single HDD. It will not convert, and it won't give you the option because you cannot convert a boot volume. You can't even erase a boot volume for that matter. However, if you boot into macOS Recovery, you will have the ability to convert your drive.\nIf you have a USB external formatted as HFS+, it will convert.  If it's formatted FAT32 (for example), it won't; you can, however  wipe it and format it with APFS.\n\nA: The rules for converting to APFS are that your drives should be HFS so that you can perform non-destructive operations to convert to APFS.But to convert to APFS you have to select the volume you want to convert and select the Edit menu on top and select Convert to APFS option.And for your Time Machine Backup can't be converted to APFS as told by Apple.\n", "Q: How to make force-click in finder show info on item?

I did a clean install and the problem still occurred. What helped for me is to switch off FileVault or disk encryption. After this, everything ran smooth again and no freezes occurred anymore.

Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected (so, unplug your external display) and make sure you use the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset the NVRAM on your particular MBP:\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\nTo reset the SMC on your particular MBP, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time:\n\n*\n\n*optioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard)\n\n*shift (on the right side of the keyboard for computers with the T2 security chip; on the left side otherwise)\n\n*power button\n\n\n\n*Keep holding for 10 seconds and then let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your computer to determine if the issue still persists.\n\nA: Connecting to an external monitor almost always works for me.\nI have had a problem with the same symptoms.

Usually, the MacBook pro built-in screen will not be recognized until the unlock process is complete.\nIf it matters, my external monitor is a display port, DELL U3011 Display, 30-inch (2560 x 1600).  Perhaps its the use of the discrete graphics chip that is the key?

If you aren't familiar, a delimiter is a separator, normally between words the separator is a space. With text item delimiters, you can change the normal space to any text value you want. In this case, you would make \"{keyword1}\" the text item delimiters, then the script will see the original text as only two words, everything before \"Keyword1\" and everything after is the second word. Then you set text item delimiters to whatever you want to replace the \"{keyword1}\" with, and cram the two words back into one text item. \nI've written some basic code that does what you ask below, with some inline comments.

On Apple's website, the company makes this claim about macOS High Sierra's security features:\n\nCan anyone give me more details on the technology that enables macOS to determine if a file downloaded with Safari is a malware ? I'm just curious to see how it compares with an antivirus (no need to start a discussion about why you need or don't need an antivirus on Mac or in general, please not for the 10000th time).\n\nA: It's part of the XProtect / file quarantine scheme built into the OS.  macOS has a hard-coded list of file signatures in /System/Library/CoreServices/XProtect.bundle/Contents/Resources/XProtect.plist.  If a file matches one of the signatures, it gets flagged and quarantined.  The list is silently updated, outside the usual software-update mechanism.\nIt is effectively a very rudimentary blacklist of known malware.

Details on why this may solve the issue can be can be found in a comment by NSGod in a similar post about el capitan:\n\nWhat's happening here is likely that the installer is trying to check its code signature, which involves checking the validity of all the certificates in the certificate chain. All certificates have an expiration date, and the application itself is likely signed with a certificate that has since expired. By setting the date to a date in the past you'll allow the certificate check to complete successfully.\n\nAs highlighted by Riley in the comments below, the format of the argument to the date command is [[[[[cc]yy]mm]dd]hh]mm[.ss].

If I start another simultaneous download in the network (iOS update, for example), the transfer time starts to increase and if it reaches some value over 15h the App Store quits the download. This happens even if the installer download is still active, only at a slower rate, as can be verified by looking for \"OS update\" in the Console app.\nUpdate 2: it seems the problem I was facing with the download “fixed itself”. Since yesterday I managed 2 full downloads without any issues on my 2 Macs.\n\nA: You can't  update because your system is running with a higher beta Version of OS X.\nLeave Apple beta Program with the devices and wait for a greater update than the system have at the moment.\nIf you need help leaving the beta Program check this:\nhttps://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/unenroll\n\nA: It seems the App Store was at a heavy load in the first days of High Sierra availability and this might have caused my download failures. Since Friday I could download High Sierra without issues on my 2 Macs and update them without any failure.\nIf your download is failing, I advise patience. The App Store will try to resume a download from where it stopped, but the installers I got doing this corrupted my Mac's and I had to restore from Time Machine.\n", "Q: Cannot upgrade to High Sierra: Unable to unmount volume for repair? I'm stuck in an upgrade loop for High Sierra. I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*2017 iMac\n\n*3.11 TB fusion drive for main drive labeled Macintosh HD in my system\n\n\nI've downloaded the High Sierra installer from the App Store and can confirm it's good and works. I did an install to an empty FW drive I have on hand and was able to complete the clean install and boot from that drive just fine.\nEvery time I try to upgrade the 10.12.6 install on my Macintosh HD drive I get:\n\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried a plain old upgrade. Running the installer Macintosh HD as you normally would. This results in the above error message.\n\n*I've booted the FW drive, force-unmounted the internal Macintosh HD volume and successfully run an First Aid scan on the drive from Disk Utility. No problems were found; green health check.\n\n*I've tried making an external upgrade drive. Following the instructions here. This drive successfully boots to the recovery screen and from there I can select an upgrade option. However, once the installation reboots the computer I get the same warning.\n\n\nI'm kind of at a loss for how to continue here. Is it the Fusion drive that's causing the problem? My understanding is you can install High Sierra on a Fusion drive just fine and the installer will leave HFS+ alone on the drive and not force an upgrade to APFS. Why would the installer think there's a disk issue when Disk Utility says there is not? How can I get more information about the problem? How can I get the system upgraded to High Sierra?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the solution to my problem was to wipe and do a fresh install of High Sierra and then restore from my Time Machine backup on first boot. Here are the steps I took. You'll need the following to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*An external USB thumb drive with at least 8 GB of free space\n\n*An external hard drive with at least 50 GB of free space\n\n\nMake sure you have a functional, up-to-date Time Machine backup\nTo do this I did a manual Time Machine backup than deleted and restored a file I care about.\nDownload High Sierra and make and an installation drive\nDownload the High Sierra installer from the App Store. Attach the USB thumb drive to your Mac and then make a bootable, High Sierra installation disk out of thumb drive by running the following in Terminal:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app\n\nWhere /Volumes/Untitled should be replaced with the name of your USB thumb drive.\nFormat an external drive and install High Sierra on that drive\nI used an older 500GB LaCie I keep kicking around for just these cases. It's fast and built well so I can trust it. Use the attached thumb drive to run the High Sierra installer. When asked which drive to install the operating system on to, click the Show More Devices button and select that USB hard drive. The installation should proceed without a problem and when the computer reboots you'll be booted from the remote drive and dropped into High Sierra. You can skip the first boot setup. You won't be using this for very long. Just make a temp account and get to logging in.\nForce unmount the internal fusion drive and format it\nHere is where the scary bit begins. You're going to force unmount the fusion drive because it'll still be mounted (and stuck) when you boot the external High Sierra image. To do this I opened up Terminal and ran:\nsudo diskutil unmount force /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD\n\nYou should replace /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD with the name of your fusion drive before you run that command. Once the drive is unmounted you can format it like so:\nsudo diskutil reformat /dev/disk2\n\nYou should replace /dev/disk2 in the above command with whatever your disk number is for your fusion drive.\nInstall High Sierra to your fusion drive using the installer\nWith the drive wiped you can proceed to install High Sierra on it using the USB thumb drive you turned into a bootable, High Sierra installation drive. Same as before, run the High Sierra installer from the thumb drive and when it asks you which disk to target select Show More Devices and find your fusion drive in the list.\nThe installation should proceed without a problem now and when your machine reboots you'll be booted from the internal drive.\nFollow the first boot prompts and restore from your Time Machine backup\nYou'll have to pick your region, connect your keyboard and mouse, and then setup WiFi. Once that is done the first boot process will give you the option to restore the computer from a Time Machine backup. Select this option. Select everything on the backup that you want restored and follow the prompts.\nOnce the restore is complete you should have a functioning High Sierra installation with all your data and user accounts on it.\n", "Q: Can I use the same cell number as my Android phone with an Apple Watch Series 3? Title says it all. I know I won’t get the most out of an Apple Watch Series 3 using it with my Android phone, but I wonder if I can at least use the same number with an LTE Apple Watch Series 3? I am on a supported network, so I think this should be possible somehow, but how do I go about it?\n\nA: Actually, what you want to do has already been done. It is possible, but not recommended. Below I will explain how you can get this to work, and then I’ll explain why it’s probably not worth doing.\nBefore you begin\nBefore you begin, you will need all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*access to an iPhone 6 (or above) that is running iOS 11 and is unlocked (or, if locked, is on the same network as your Android phone)\n\n*an Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE\n\n*your Android phone (but it must be an Android phone that uses a microSIM)\n\n\nObviously, it goes without saying that you also need to be on a network that supports the Apple Watch Series 3 LTE models (which you already say you are).\nWhat you need to do\nFollow these steps to setup your Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE on the same mobile number as your Android phone. Note that these steps assume you have a brand new Apple Watch that has yet to be setup.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the microSIM from your Android phone\n\n*Remove the microSIM from the iPhone you’re using\n\n*Insert the microSIM from your Android phone into the iPhone\n\n*Wait about 30 seconds or so for the iPhone to register your mobile connection\n\n*Open the Watch app on the iPhone\n\n*Press and hold the side button (not the Crown) of your Apple Watch until you see the Apple logo appear (Note: This may take a while, so be patient)\n\n*Once it’s on, ensure you have the Apple Watch and iPhone close together\n\n*On your iPhone, tap on Continue when you see a message about setting up an Apple Watch\n\n*An animation will appear on your Apple Watch screen. Hold your iPhone over it so that the animation is centred within the viewfinder on your iPhone.\n\n\n\n*Once it is paired, select whether you eat to wear the Apple Watch on your left or right wrist\n\n*When the terms and conditions appear, tap on Agree\n\n*Now you’ll be prompted to tap on Agree again\n\n*Follow the rest of the prompts to sign in with your Apple ID, create a passcode, set up your Cellular (or Mobile) connection, etc.\n\n*Eventually you will see an Apple Watch is Syncing message. Be patient while this process finishes, as it can take quite a while!\n\n*Now remove the microSIM from the iPhone and re-insert it into your Android phone\n\n*Wait about 30 seconds or so for your Android phone to register its mobile connection\n\n\n\nNow you should be able to use your Apple Watch with the same number/network of your Android phone. \nWhy it’s not recommended\nThere are a number of reasons why using an LTE Apple Watch with Android is not recommended. In summary, the three main reasons not to do this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Apple Watch’s battery life will be really bad as it’ll be relying on it’s cellular connection the whole time, as opposed to using a paired connection with an iPhone most of the time\n\n*All your health and fitness data will remain on your Apple Watch and can’t be synced with any of your Android apps\n\n*Because of the above two reasons, your overall user experience will be poor!\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up your Apple Watch \n\n*Set up and use cellular on Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS + Cellular) \n\n*How to use an LTE Apple Watch with Android\n", "Q: High Sierra - Terminal lags if background opacity is set After upgrading, I noticed my terminal got extremely slow (MBP 2013). There is a noticeable input delay, moving the window or switching to another application lags and skips the animation. I noticed the background needs around 1s to recreate the opacity/blur effect after window switching, so I tried disabling the effect in the settings, which restored previous performance completely.\nIs this a known issue? I'd like to have my transparent, blurred background back.\n\nA: So, for completeness' sake since there doesn't seem to be a better answer as of yet, I'll add my solution.\nIf your Terminal.app started showing the behavior outlined in the question and you have modified the blur/opacity settings, turning these off will restore previous performance. To do so, open the terminal settings (⌘ + ,), switch to the Profile tab and click on the background color picker next to color & effects. Here, set the faders for opacity and blur to 100%.  \n\nIf someone finds a way to enable transparency again without trashing performance, I'll be happy to accept their answer.\n\nA: Ran into the same problem. For me it's just the blur effect. Transparency does not cause me issues. It seems to be the case for other terminal apps too, (I tried iTerm2, and as soon as I enabled it's blurred background effect it had the same performance issues). This is all since the High Sierra upgrade.\nFor now I'm disabling blur to get around the problem. Hope it gets addressed soon. \n", "Q: Accidentally deleted /Library/Developer files I accidentally deleted my /Library/Developer files while trying to delete the Derived Data.

High Sierra removes Google Talk support for Messages. That's not really Apple's fault, as Google is migrating all Google Talk functionality to Hangouts and doesn't allow third-party clients to connect to Hangouts. But after upgrading from Sierra on a machine that was logged in to a Google Talk account, Messages is still connected to that account and receives messages but can't send them. How can I log Messages out of this account which is now useless? It doesn't show in the Accounts tab of the Messages preferences.\n\nA: This might help https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/107120.\nI would do the different steps and then start from scratch. Or... you might try checking what each file in those directories do and see if yo can delete the account manually.\nIf you try the each file method, it appears that the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.Jabber.plist contains the Google Accounts. If you see your account delete it and relaunch Messages.\nImportant: Please backup your files before doing something that might harm your OS. ALWAYS. I've learned this the hard way. It's always easier to copy back files than to have to fix something from scratch.\n\nA: You don't see Google under Internet Accounts?\nIf so disable Messages.\nIf not, sign out/remove Google out of accounts and then sign back in.\n\nA: I upgraded to High Sierra and found that my Google Talk account stopped receiving messages automatically (fixed in newer version maybe?), so not sure if this works, but I have a couple suggestions:\n1) Try removing your Google account from Internet Accounts completely and making sure that you don't keep receiving messages.\n2) If that's not enough, open Keychain Access and do a search for keys with the name Google in them. You can view and copy the passwords and info to a text file if you would like a backup. Delete any that you find.\nAfter you do either of those, make sure to go to Internet Accounts and either add it back or re-enter the password for your Google account. Hope this works for you!\n", "Q: Cannot delete Desktop and Documents folder from iCloud Drive after accidentally enabling their storage on iCloud While upgrading to macOS Sierra I accidentally enabled storage of my Desktop & Documents Folders in iCloud. I quickly reversed that by disabling the option, then moving my files back to their place on my local drive. \nEven though the option is now disabled on all my macOS account, I still cannot delete the Desktop and Documents folders from iCloud Drive. No matter what I do, they keep coming back moments after being deleted.\nI tried the following with no success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the folders from the affected macOS account;\n\n*Delete the folders from another macOS account connected to the same iCloud account (I never enabled the option on this account);\n\n*Turn off the MacBook and delete the folders from Files on iOS;\n\n*Delete the folders from icloud.com;\n\n\nNo matter what I do, these two folders keep coming back moments later. This leads to the Dektop and Documents folders local to my MacBook being renamed to Desktop — Local and Documents — Local respectively, which is quite annoying.\nHow can I delete these two folders from iCloud Drive?\n\nA: Using trash works for me as well.\nThere is a delete immediately (in case you don't want to empty trash, also easier than racing to beat the iCloud Drive restore of Desktop and Documents) option - click OPT+CMD+Delete \nThere are prompts to answer to confirm the in place deletion you must answer for the delete to happen.\n\nA: From my MacBook's Finder window, I deleted the empty Desktop folder from iCloud Drive and then immediately emptied the trash before the folder had time to reappear in iCloud Drive. The folder did not reappear. \nAfter a few seconds iCloud refreshed and the Documents folder was deleted from my iOS device as well! \nI then followed the same steps to delete the empty Documents folder.\nCheers!\n\nA: 2020: It's still happening using macOS 11.1 Big Sur\nI had a small file on the Desktop that I deleted in Finder, it went in the bin as expected. Every time I emptied the bin then file would reappear in the bin after a few seconds.\nDelete using Finder\nI tried the methods mentioned here by Kevin R. & ROG:\n\n*\n\n*Emptying trash immediately: nope\n\n*CMD + OPT + Delete: nope\n\n*Renaming the file, then deleting: nope\n\n*Moving the file out of an iCloud Drive folder: nope\n\nAlso tried from Terminal using  rm -f. The file reappeared every time.\nOnline iCloud Drive\nSign-in to iCloud drive via https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/\nThe file was there in the Recently Deleted page so I deleted the file from there. It did disappear from my Mac's bin and them promptly reappeared after a few seconds on the Recently Deleted page and on my Mac.\nI reasoned iCloud Drive identifies files by hashing their contents and that's why the rename would not work. The file's hash was stuck somewhere in the sync process.\nWhat worked for me:\nTo remove the file, firstly alter it's contents, in this case I renamed it to be a .txt file, then opened the renamed file in a text editor, added some extra random characters, then saved the file. As the contents changed, the hash used by iCloud also changed.\nAfter deleting the updated file, it no longer reappeared in the bin, or anywhere else. SUCCESS!\nSo alter the contents of the file, then delete.\n", "Q: Swipe up/down on window top to maximize/resize to default size I upgraded my Mac's OS from macOS Sierra to macOS High Sierra today and found one feature disappeared: I used to swipe up on top empty area of a window to maximize the window to \"fill\" the full screen (not the natural full screen, ie, a new desktop space, just making the window as large as possible in the same space); also, by swiping down when the mouse position is on the window top I could resize the window to default size, in the center of the screen.\nI can't remember if it is a feature enabled by a util app (like Hyperdock) or can be configured in System Preferences. I googled around but cannot find it.\n\nA: Update: I find the app! It is HyperDock.

I rarely used the Keychain Access Menubar Item for the Lock Screen feature; my screen is set to lock after a short period of inactivity. I used the Keychain Access Menubar Item to access my keychain data and to quickly and easily create UserID/Passcodes outside of Safari and to create Secure Notes and to grab Certs. \nPlease, see my Crude Solution below.\n\nA: \"Lock Screen\" is now available via the Apple menu. \n\n\nA: Another way to accomplish this is to copy the keychain menulette from an older version of the keychain access bundle.  Version 9 from Sierra works great.  \nPut the file in the following folder and double click it\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/Keychain.menu\n\nA: Another way is to add an automator app to the Scripts menu.  The automator script is simply \"Launch Application KeychainAccess.app\".  After creating the app, don't forget to add it to the Scripts folder in your home Library.\n\nA: I think addition of Lock Screen option in the menu bar has been removed from High Sierra 10.13.1 version.\nBut now you can find it right under the apple menu.\nAlso you can now use a keyboard shortcut to lock your screen i.e. Control⌘ CommandQ.\nImportant note: After this update you might also find that touch id is not working.

The installer started downloading the macOS High Sierra It almost downloaded the OS but its stuck on About one minute remaining\nI cancelled this after 3-4 hours after stuck at this point. And again downloaded from start. It again stuck at the same point.\nI have macBookPro mid-2012 and according to apple MacBook Pro 2010 and later are compatible for macOS High Sierra update. \nWhat can be the possible issue and solution?\n\n\nA: Given the context of your question, it's unclear if you re-downloaded the installer from the App Store after the first failure or if you ran the upgrade application again. Yes, your computer is supported for the High Sierra update. I have a few suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the upgrade application (go to the Finder and delete it).\n\n*Re-download the upgrade application from the App Store.\n\n*Run the application again.\n\n\nIf the problem persists, the solution will probably involve something more drastic. If you have an available flash drive, try making a bootable flash drive installer. Restart and hold (Option) and select the bootable USB disk and hit enter. Proceed through the install process. Notify us of the result and we'll proceed from there :)\nGood luck ;)\n\nA: Normal delay is expected, maybe the server is busy or your OS is searching/installing something that is resource-intensive. Is it finished now ? \n", "Q: iMessage and FaceTime not working with Apple ID any more My iMessage and FaceTime suddenly stopped working with my Apple ID on my Macbook Pro (OS X 10.9.5) during my vacation at NYC.\nEven on my iPhone (iOS 10.3.3) I can now only use iMessage and FaceTime with my phone number, but not with my Apple ID independent from my location.\nEverytime I try to activate iMessage and FaceTime on my MacBook and my iPhone following error is shown:\n\nAn error occurred during activation\n\nI've checked my Date & Time settings and the current location to be true, reset NVRAM and checked all my settings, but there is no solution in sight. I also deleted my Apple ID accounts from all my Apple devices and reconnected them after a reboot of each device, like recommended by Apple and several other webpages.\nDoes anyone know a possible solution, or has similar problems?\nI don't want to update my Mac or iPhone. The solutions provided to the question Messages won't let me sign in to iMessage suggesting to clear NVRAM and to delete the keychain don't work for me, and iMessage and FaceTime do work but only with my phone number.\n\nA: This sometimes happened to me when I reset my iPhone/iPad and have to activate them again. Most of the time it was due to connection issues with Apple activation servers. I would just switch from WiFi to 4G/LTE (vice versa) and it works. Or maybe you can test with another Apple ID, or try to reset your network setting. \n\nA: I was able to solve the problem by updating to macOS High Sierra.\n", "Q: Apple Script Won't \"Click\" No Button I have used Accessibility Inspector to confirm the names of the windows and buttons involved, but (on macOS 10.12) AppleScript will not \"click\" the No button in this Logitech window.

Is my iPad broken?\n\nA: Keep your iPad charging for at least some hours and let's see if the battery can \"wake up\". Some of my old cellphones' battery only \"wake up\" after like one day of charging. Hope everything is alright, or you would need to have the battery replaced. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro instability over the last few months I have a Mid-2012 MacBook Pro. The last few months my MBP has been very unstable. I must have performed a clean install roughly around 15 times. \nEverything works well right after a fresh install, however, give it a day or two, and it's unstable again. I don't really keep a lot of data on it, just use it mostly for browsing. \nThe problems I encounter are stalling, the beachball spinning while I am browsing or typing. A lot of times the beachball just doesn't stop spinning or stalls itself. At this point everything else stops functioning hence forcing me to perform a hard boot.\nI upgraded to High Sierra yesterday, and had to do a clean install again today. Before performing the clean install, I tried rebooting in Safe Mode, didn't work. Even if I did manage to log in to the user account, nothing was loading. \nI've performed the disk utility check and all seems fine. At least that's what I think. What am I supposed to be looking for after performing the disk utility check? It doesn't show up with any errors. \nAll seems to be working fine with the guest account. However in order to be entirely sure about the guest account, I would have to use it for an extended period of time. I suspect my iCloud account might be corrupted. \nIs it possible for a corrupted iCloud account to cause such instabilities with Mac? \n\nA: i hate this beachball, but you can do some things, first is to start with cmd+r and go to terminal and write     csrutil disable and reboot. now your sip is disabled and you should  enable it in the same way when your finished with this steps:   \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to About this    mac under the apple in the upper left and click\non More info\n\n*Click on system report\n\n*make a note of what it says after Model Identifier\n\n\n*go to your masterdrive–System-Library–Extensions–\nIOPlatformPluginFamily.kext-Contents–Plugins–ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin.kext–\nContents–Resources – find the name from step 3 and move it to a\nfolder that you can find again if needed.\n\n\n\nNow reboot and check, if your mac is running better. you can also    check in disk utility the kerneltask before and after youremoved the    file. dont forget to enable your sip now. \nwhat is about your cpu    temperatur or fan, to high? you can solve this\nonly by disconnect you    battery and powersupply. Now hold down the\non/off button for min 5    better 10 seconds. Rebuild your batterie\nand reboot. Next thing is pr    ram reset, start while holding\ncmd+option+p+r, wait until you hear    the loud mac startup sound\nand release then the mac start up again.    clear cache by start\nwhile holding shift, log in and reboot.  that    should make a hugh\n    difference like before. you can run from time to    time in terminal\n    sudo purge   to clear your used ram. cheers**\n", "Q: Enable autocorrect in Chrome on OSX Sierra? OSX includes pretty decent spell checker and autocorrect. Problem is, it's not working in Chrome, and Chrome is about everything today: we spend our days browsing, lots of modern chat & mail apps are just wrappers around web apps in Chrome window or some other browser-engine. \nAccording to some technical discussions, Chrome decided to ditch Apple's system autocorrect in favour of their own spell checker, which works fairly well, but DOES NOT autocorrect things! It just underlines typos, but won't correct them for me, making it useless in fast-typing scenarios. \nI found many questions (mostly dated 2015 and earlier) on the web about this matter, yet no practical solutions for OSX, which makes me wonder -- have we given up on this? Or there's some common solution that I missed? \n\nA: Another solution I have seen many used is to use a Chrome extension like Grammarly. \nJust be aware that their privacy terms and/or security posture may not suit many users. See for example source 1, source 2, and much more info out there if you search for it. \n\nA: The issue to add Autocorrect to the spell checker on macOS has been closed in 2021 due to lack of headcount on Chrome's side. It's unlikely it will be fixed anytime soon.\n", "Q: Remote File and Application access from iMac to Macbook (Not screen sharing) I use an iMac (2017, 27 inches) and a MacBook Pro (2013,13 inches) for software development and UI design. My work is remote 90% of the time and I use GitHub and other cloud services for sync. \nProblem:\nThe problem I'm facing is that my iMac and MacBook both need to have the same software suites like Xcode, Adobe Suite, etc. to run the projects themselves. I have to keep multiple licenses of same software, not to mention my MacBook has only 128 GB and only 4 GB RAM, it takes a hell load of time to compile the same application too.\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen Mirroring: Numerous screen sharing services (Native\nscreen/file/remote sharing, Screens Viewer, Team Viewer, many others!) but the lag is HUGE and the aspect ratio is completely messed up to the point that I cannot see text.\n\n*Server OS: Bought MacOS server with a hope to have complete \"native\"\nfile system and application (Xcode, Photoshop) access from my MacBook\nbut it doesn't let me access the whole file system and 0 application\naccess even as an admin with login privileges granted.\n\n\nCan anyone direct me to a solution that I can use?\n\nA: Hardware\nYou have two vastly different hardware platforms.  One (iMac) has twice the standard memory of the other (MacBook Pro) - 8GB versus 4GB and two generations and (approx) 30% difference in clock speed.  You're also developing UI on a 27 inch screen then switching to a 13\" screen\nThere's no getting around this discrepancy in horsepower.\nSoftware Licensing\nThis shouldn't be an issue on two computers.\n\n*\n\n*XCode is free and you can install it on multiple computers that is associated with your developer ID\n\n\n*Adobe CC products can be installed and activated on two computers simultaneously, but you can only use one at a time.\nRemote Work\nIf your work is 90% remote as in you live out of a suitcase, your best bet it is get the most powerful MacBook Pro you can afford and utilize external monitors (hotel TVs perhaps?).\nIf it's remote as in you work out of your house, your current setup is fine - you just need to move your data to the cloud (iCloud, OneDrive, etc.)  and sync the data and install the apps on each Mac.\n\nA: Screen-sharing still remains the most possible, economical and widely-used solution to cases like yours. I used TeamViewer/Chrome Remote Desktop throughout the years and it's acceptable. If you want to spend money, don't go for the server route to achieve this. Instead, maybe sell your iMac and upgrade to a better MacBook. It's the best solution.\n", "Q: Mac use Cmd-Opt-Control-Shift-, (comma) as a hotkey Is there a way to use CommandOptionControlShift, as  hotkey? \nThe same modifier keys (CommandOptionControlShift) work fine with letters, but I can't seem to make it do anything when using the , key. \nIs it a system hotkey that needs to be removed from a plist somewhere? Or is it something deeper that can't be reassigned at all?\n\nA: Command-Option-Shift-Control-, starts a system diagnose process. I'm not really sure about the specifics, but try it and you'll get a zip archive with some information in it. \n\nA: I was able to hotkey CommandOptionControlShift, in Spectacle and XCode by inputting CommandOptionControlShift+/+, where /+, are input as separate keystrokes.\nIn Spectacle it listed the binding as ⌃⌥⌘⇧,.\nIn XCode it listed the binding as ⌃⌥⌘<.\nTo trigger the hotkey, you must input CommandOptionControlShift+/+,\n", "Q: Recursively change file type I have folders, containing files and folders.\nAmong these files, some have extension, some have no extension.\nI noticed that a file without extension can have a type (probably stored in some kind of metadata)\nExample of a TextEdit file without extension :\n\nExample of a Document Sublime Text file without extension :\n\nWhat I want is recursively exploring folders and changing the type of files without extension.\nI am not talking about setting a default app for all files without extension.\nI am talking about changing each file individually (metadata), to set there type to \"Document Sublime Text\"\nI am looking for something like that :\nfind ./ -depth <file has no extension> -exec <set file type = Document Sublime Text>\n\nOr an AppleScript !\n\nA: I did it with xattr !\nMy final script is :\nfind FOLDER -type f ! -name \"*.*\" -print0 | xargs -0 xattr -wx com.apple.LaunchServices.OpenWith \\\n\"`xattr -px com.apple.LaunchServices.OpenWith FILEWITHGOODTYPE`\"\n\nReplace FOLDER by your folder (containing files without extension) (drag and drop)\nReplace FILEWITHGOODTYPE by a file which has the expected type (drag and drop)\n\nI found what I was looking for here :\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/q/4833052/4135158\n", "Q: VoiceOver and Emoji and Symbols viewer VoiceOver uses Control-Command-Space for launching an action but I can't use it because Emoji and Symbols Viewer hijacks it.

External monitor outputs work fine. I turned off Flux and Night Shift, but the problem persists. Calibrating white point did not fix it either. \nIs this reparable and is it covered under warranty?\n\nA: \nIs it repairable?\n\nYes.  The backlight or the entire screen assembly can (should) be replaced.  This is something you can do yourself with a replacement LCD and the instructions from ifixit.com.  It's basically removing the back panel, disconnect the display and WiFi cables, then detaching the assembly brackets/hinges.\n\nis it covered under warranty?\n\nWhen did you purchase it?

I'm not sure if this will be helpful, but after banging at this for hours tonight, looking line by line thru all of the .conf files, and wondering what was wrong, I realized that httpd process wasn't able to read my own user directory.  For some reason it was set as 750, and the _www user is unable to read it.  Once I fixed that by running \"chmod 755 .\" on my user directory, the Sites folder showed right up.\nI'm not sure how my own user directory got like that, as it appears that they default to 755 when I create a new user.  And I had already double-checked many times that my Sites folder was set to 755.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I uncommented the two lines below (as already suggested in another response)\n#LoadModule vhost_alias_module libexec/apache2/mod_vhost_alias.so \n#Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n\nBut still got the same error. The trick for me was uncommenting these additional lines in the httpd.conf file:\n#LoadModule userdir_module libexec/apache2/mod_userdir.so \n#LoadModule include_module libexec/apache2/mod_include.so \n#LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I have had the same issue. The resolution was easy. See answer posted here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/306390/129503\n\nI faced the same after I upgraded to High Sierra earlier today.

Sometimes however, instead of launching a normal finder window complete with sidebar (something like this), it instead launches a window without a sidebar, like this . Why does this happen and how do I prevent it from happening?\n\nA: On my computer, ⌘⌥+T toggles the toolbars on/off. \nMaybe you have this keyboard shortcut set to ⌘⌥ + M,N,B,V, or C, such that you accidentally hit both shortcuts?\nYou can check in your SysPrefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts pane, or just try those shortcuts that are near the space bar.\nI suggest this because of your assertion that it happens \"sometimes\", which is pretty weird.  I did once have my toolbars always missing, which it turns out required some preference file to be deleted or something.  But I've never seen an intermittent issue like that.\n", "Q: Will leaving the screen of an iPad turned on 24/7 decrease its lifespan? I am coding a time attendance app to be used on an iPad in a secure mount outdoors (in a weather proof box).  \nI am thinking of blocking the home button, and leaving the iPad’s screen turned on at all times.  \nI was wondering if this will reduce the lifespan of the iPad by a significant amount.\nAlso, are there any other ideas on how to solve this problem?  Proximity sensor with camera would be pretty cool.  Or really just light vs dark sensing.\n\nA: This is incredibly common for independant cafes and small restaurants using iPads as POS systems. I have personally had several iPads that are literally always on and they have lasted years.\nI have also used cheap android tablets for the same purpose and as kitchen displays. They have their place and sometimes make sense but I’ve had to replace them often enough to say that I doubt that you would see a significant cost savings going that route. \nIf the outdoor weather proof box gets extremely hot you might see a difference but all the iPads I’ve used have been in fairly harsh conditions with very few problems. \n\nA: I would be more concerned about the heat. Leaving the screen turned on surely will heat up your device and decrease the lifespan of your battery. But that doesn't mean your iPad will be broken in one month or so. If you need a more economical way, buy an OEM Android tablet. \n", "Q: Applescript to open all files in a folder and convert to PDF with Preview I've written an AppleScript to do as the title describes.

My computer has an SSD for the OS and an HDD for data.  Does Time Machine back up the OS too?  Does it back up both drives?  I didn't see an option for that when I set it up.  When I restore, it tells me to pick a drive to restore the system.  Does that mean the operating system?  Should I pick the SSD?\n\nA: Time Machine backs up you entire Mac, including system files, applications, accounts, preferences, email messages, music, photos, movies, and documents. By default, Time Machine should back up all connected drives except your Time Machine drives. Presumably if it's asking which drive to restore the OS to, you should pick the SSD. I can't verify if it'll attempt to restore the other drive's files there, but I doubt it; at worst, you'll still have your backups and can manually restore from there.\n", "Q: Apple iPad Wifi 2017 How Do I delete apps with the new iOS 11 update?

As the title states, I am trying to ascertain whether or not it is possible to program (using XCode, I'm guessing) iOS apps for iPad and iPhone using an iPad. \nI cannot find any related details using Google or by searching the Apple website. Apple's recent advertisements lead me to believe they are marketing iPad as more of a general purpose computer and less of a tablet-centric device. If the former is true, it should be possible to create apps written in Swift using the device, right?\n\nA: Yes and no, but mainly no. Let me explain.\nYou can't use an iPad (at least not yet) to go through the entire process (i.e. design, test, and submit your app). You also can't use Xcode on an iPad (at least not directly, although you could do this remotely - but that is not a practical solution).\nPeople can and do use iPads for:\n\n\n*\n\n*learning how to code\n\n*editing code using various editors (but not Xcode)\n\n*designing some of the other resources/assets used in apps (e.g. images, icons, sounds, etc)\n\n\nHowever, most development is done using an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Xcode. Most apps for iOS (and macOS, tvOS, and watchOS) are programmed and submitted via Xcode, although there are alternatives.\n\nA: Codea is an iPad app that can be used to develop mainly games for the iPad. You can develop and test your game on the iPad but if you wish to publish it you will need to go thru Xcode. Codea uses Lua as its programming language. Codea is quite popular and has an active helpful internet message board.\nI've also heard of people writing apps in Python. There is an iPad/iPhone app, called Pythonista, that allows you to write and run python scripts on an iPad and iPhones.\n\nA: Starting with iPadOS 15, Apple is adding the ability to \"Build apps on your iPad\" (WWDC June 7th 2021 video timestamp 47:26). According Apple, you will be able to build, preview and submit apps for iPhone and iPad to the app store from your iPad when iPadOS 15 is released this fall.\n\n\nA: If you want to make iOS app using Xcode then probably not. You can use iPad for learning Swift programming language using Apple's Swift Playgrounds app though.\n\nA: @algorithmjunkie\nFor iOS making an iOS App (for iPhone or iPad)\nYou need to install XCode (For Native App making)\nOr Xamarin (For Hi-bride App making)\nBut for this software you need any Mac OS system like (iMac ,Mackbook for Xcode ) or windows (  Hi-bride App making using Xamarin )\nSo in iPad you can't install Xcode or Xamarin software , So you can't create iOS app from iPad,\nIf you have any any problem to buy Mac for highly cost \nYou can use create custom mac system , this machine cost is same like windows.\nIf you need any help for creating custom Mac then you can comment here.\n\nA: Yes using VNC viewer you can run another device and run visual studio\nUsing visual studio you can make Mac OS apps and more\n", "Q: How To Include External Microphone Audio In Headphones? I have a pair of headphones with an AntLion ModMic (https://antlionaudio.com) that I use for making VoIP calls with a soft phone. Everything is working properly with one small caveat -- I can't hear audio from the microphone in my headphones.\nAudio input is coming from the AntLion through a Plantronics USB adapter. Audio output is coming from a USB DAC to my Sony headphones. So separate inputs and outputs.\nWhen I use a single USB headset, the microphone audio is blended in with what I hear in the headphones and I'd like to do the same thing with the two separate sources.\nThe only solution I have found is to use SoundSource (http://www.rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) and use the audio play through feature. Not the end of the world, but I was wondering if anyone had any other suggestions.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I'm going to end up sounding like a one-man advertising campaign for Rogue Amoeba ;-)\nNo affiliation, merely a satisfied user, for many years\nUnless you want to mess with the highly unreliable Soundflower - originally made by Cycling 74, once maintained by Rogue Amoeba but now open-sourced at GitHub - then the only way to go is something made & still supported by Rogue Amoeba.  \nAudio Hijack, LoopBack & SoundSource are all based on the same [reliable] technology, but tweaked for different sets of user requirements.\nSoundSource is the latest - & cheapest - of their offerings.\nIf it does all that you need, then it's the one to go for.\n", "Q: Is it possible to be notified when a prerelease album is available on Apple Music? I have downloaded an album on Apple Music several months ago when it became available on pre-release. At the time, only one song was available to listen to. I had forgotten all about it and it sat amongst my albums and the release date came and went.  Weeks later, I was scrolling through my albums and I saw it there. \nIs it possible to get notified when a pre-release album is fully released? I'm using both iPad and iPhone on iOS11.\n\nA: Not sure if you’d get notified if the pre-release turns into a proper release, but you can get notified when artists you usually listen to release new stuff. Chances are that the upgrade from pre-release to actual release generates a notification as well.\nYou can configure the notifications by following the Apple Support Document, Get Apple Music notifications.\n", "Q: How to reset Launchpad order in macOS High Sierra? I'm not sure how to reset my Launchpad so my apps are in alphabetical order on macOS High Sierra.\nI've tried running \ndefaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool TRUE;\n\nkillAll Dock;\n\nwhich worked fine with macOS Sierra but since updating to macOS High Sierra, this command no longer works. \nAll it does is separate the built-in apps to be on the 1st page but the installed apps are not alphabetical (see photos below).\n\nPage 1 of Launchpad (built-in apps)\n\n\n\nPage 2 of Launchpad (not in alphabetical order)\n\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions?\n\nA: At the moment, it seems there are two answers to your question. The one answer is exactly the method you've laid out above (or the equivalent of removing the database at /var/folders/). The other option is... you can't.\nWith High Sierra, most - if not all - flash storage-based Macs had their file system upgraded to APFS from HFS+. Now, I haven't exhaustively read Apple's documentation on APFS but there is one item in the FAQ that sticks out to me which reads:\n\nCalling readdir(2) on a directory in APFS returns filenames in hash order, whereas HFS+ returns filenames in lexicographical order.\n  [Source: Apple Developer Documentation]\n\nThe defaults trick technically still works. On HFS+ disks in High Sierra it still works as expected (tested by myself). On an APFS formatted drive you can see that it does something in that it resets the order but just not alphabetically. The order, then, is most likely arranged by the hash of the apps' names and not by the names themselves.\nThe solution for APFS? All I can think of right now is using a database tool to manually sort the entries in to alphabetical order. But then again, might as well just drag and drop...\n", "Q: How to pick a recovery partition to boot into when there are multiple? I have a Mac Mini with a Fusion Drive.

I happened to have rEFInd installed on my Mac and I found the the missing recovery partition appeared on the rEFInd menu. Although, I do not know for certain, I assume the same would work for Core Storage.\nSo if you have rEFInd properly installed in a EFI partition, you may be able to use the steps given below to boot your missing recovery partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the Startup Manager. Basically, hold down the option key at startup.\n\n*From the Startup Manger, select to boot rEFInd.\n\n*From rEFInd, select to boot macOS 10.13 recovery.\nWhat I would do is create a USB flash drive bootable version of rEFInd.

We could open the screen to about 70-80 deg and I could see everything, beyond that it would go blank. Needed to turn off , close screen totally open to less than 70-80 deg and it would work when we powered up again, then if we pushed the screen past the 70-80 deg it went blank again. This was enough of a fix to get my daughter out of trouble and her frustration cranky pants mood, (because of her year 11 (Australia High School) work on the computer), until we came up with a new screen.

Since the upgrade to High Sierra my MacBook is crashing regularly in a catastrophic way that forces me to trigger a hard reset every time.\nI suspect htop being the culprit, but I can't tell for sure.\nThis is what happened about half a dozen times now:\nI'm working in either iTerm2 or the Terminal app. Suddenly and seemingly at random iTerm2/Terminal crashes. I'm still able to Force Quit it then.\nBut then the whole system is left in a really messed up state where I can't start any Apps anymore. Even worse, triggering a restart won't succeed in shutting down the system. My only option left then is to hard-reset the MacBook.\nFirst I suspected iTerm2 and used the Terminal app instead. But exactly the same thing then also happened using the latter. It does not seem to be connected to anything particular I'm doing in the Terminal.\nI do have the habit though to always have an instance of htop (version 2.0.2, installed via brew install htop) running in some terminal pane to be able to conveniently monitor processes and CPU/Memory usage while I'm working.\nSo a running htop instance is the only common precondition for the crashes I can identify.\nBecause I don't know how to further encircle this problem, I resort to asking here:\nIs anyone else experiencing (similar) problems with running htop on High Sierra? And does anyone maybe even have a solution for this?\nSuggestions about what I could do to get to the bottom of this would also be very welcome.\n\nA: I the meantime lots of people have reported the same behavior on GitHub.\nAlso, I'm 96.73% sure that htop does not crash when started with sudo.

With iOS, certificates are installed as part of profiles. Deleting a certificate means removing the profile.\nWhen an iPhone with profiles is backed up, and then the backup is restored to a new device, the profiles are no longer visible under Settings > General > Profiles.

This problem is plaguing our users and driving management crazy. We have users that are onsite that need to share file locations for files that are on a local server as links in email to other users.  They do so by right clicking on the file, clicking get info, and selecting the path from the \"Where\" section of the file properties.\nSome of those users may be connected to the network via VPN, so the afp://appleserver01._afpovertcp._tcp.local in the link doesn't work for them.\nWe have found that if we manually map a drive using \"Connect to Server\" or Command+K procedure, using the following:\nafp://servername.domain.tld/mountpoint results in afp://servername.domain.tld/mountpoint/filename.txt when we select a file and right click, get info, in the Where section.\nafp://ipaddress/mountpoint results in afp://ipaddress/mountpoint/filename.txt when we select a file and right click, get info, in the Where section.\nBoth of these options are clickable as email links for on-premise users and VPN connected users.\nThe problem is that if a user opens Finder and clicks on the server name directly without going through the \"Connect to Server\" or Command+K method, then the \"Where\" location in file properties when clicking get info is almost always something like afp://appleserver01._afpovertcp._tcp.local/mountpoint/filename.txt, which doesn't actually work for some users including VPN connected users.\nHow can we force the \"Where\" location to always be afp://hostname.domain.tld/ always instead of afp://appleserver01._afpovertcp._tcp.local/ when a user clicks on the server in Finder?\nWhat causes this inconsistent behavior?\nEdit: This is for Mac OS X 10.11.6 & 10.12.6 (not tested on High Sierra yet).\nWe are only concerned with files that are stored on a shared resource (server).\n\nA: Number one, something might be wrong with your VPN, because everything should work as if you were physically in the office. You might want to check that.\nNumber two, I assume the remote machines use the wrong IP address when connecting to the servers. And if they are actually successful with some of the tricks you mentioned, you might have a few security issues (maybe caused by someone opening up too much of the network). But I don't fully understand the setup, so take that with a grain of salt.\nNumber three, I suggest considering a web server with all the necessary protections and storing the files there. Lots of such 'cloud' solutions are available, some for free, also with your own cloud servers, to keep the data local. With some technical knowledge, one can set it up with normal server software, too.\nThere are three main advantages: Access is possible without VPN access - much safer for some use cases. You can see and control what each person is doing on the server. And you can prepare to make the documents open online, which allows you to keep full control of them - no versions downloaded and then the laptop gets stolen...\n", "Q: How do I change the e-mail address that receives Apple Pay notifications? When I submit a transaction using Apple Pay, all of my notification e-mails go to the wrong address (one of mine, but not the correct one).\nOn iOS, the relevant setting (Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay > Transaction Defaults) already has the correct e-mail address, but it's not used. I've also added the correct details within the Apple Pay payment screen but that isn't used or even remembered for subsequent purchases either.\nHow do I select a different address for use with Apple Pay?\n\nA: From the Apple Pay Support page:\n\nUpdate your billing and contact information\nLearn how to update your billing and shipping information for the cards that you use with Apple Pay.\niPhone or iPad\n\n*\n\n*To change your billing information, go to Settings > Wallet & Apple\nPay, tap a card, then tap what you want to update.\n\n*To update your email address, phone number, and shipping address, go to Settings >\nWallet & Apple Pay, then choose what you want to update.\n\n\n\nA: In iOS 13.7, there is a TRANSACTION DEFAULTS section of the Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay menu that allows the user to specify default card, shipping address, phone and email for Apple Pay transactions.\n\nA: If you are asking about making a transaction on your mac via Apple Pay, I discovered today that my mac (OS X 10.15.7) caches my email, shipping and other addresses independently with my Apple ID.\nThis apple support article gave me some clues: https://support.apple.com/en-mide/guide/mac-help/mchl29cac995/10.15/mac/10.15\nGo into System Preferences, click the Apple ID icon top right, on its screen click Payment and Shipping in the left sidebar, where you see Apple card click the little button Details... then (after entering your password) you should see the cached billing address.  Mine was all wrong, and I cannot change it there.\nThe text on that dialog/popup says \"On an iOS device running iOS 12.2 or later, you can change the payment method for your Apple ID in Settings. On a Mac or PC, use the Mac App Store or iTunes.\"  (Hey apple, iTunes doesn't exist anymore.)\nSo I logged in to appleid.app.com.  In the Payment & Shipping section (scroll down to see it), I see an Edit button.  I click it, then I finally my billing address, and it's invalid.  But I cannot edit that address.  This is a SNAFU.\nFinally on my phone, in Settings -> Apple ID -> Payment & Shipping, I simply removed the Apple Card as a payment option.  Then went down to the billing address section and suddenly it was editable!  Why was it locked when the Apple Card was there?  I cannot explain it.\n\nA: It looks like the email address in wallet & Pay settings pulls from your contact card, not just what you input in wallet & Pay settings. Try adding the email that you want to use into your contact card before you select it in wallet & Pay settings and see if that helps it stick.\n", "Q: How do I manually add a URL as a bookmark in Safari?

I have an USB External Hard Drive which has been behaving strangely lately. I'm concerned, amongst other things, that it doesn't seem to Eject properly1.\nWhen I\n\n*\n\n*Press the Eject button in Finder;\n\n*Eject the Volume in Disk Utility;\n\n*Or diskutil unmountDisk in Terminal;\n\nthe drive continues to be listed in Disk Utility and diskutil list in Terminal. It is however not visible in Finder. Adding to my concerns is that the drive make mechanical sounds even after Eject.\nMy question is if it's normal that the drive continues to be listed in Disk Utility and diskutil even after Eject? To me it seems strange, but perhaps it's intentional in the sense that the Volume has been unmounted but the drive is still USB-connected?\n\n1What has raised my concerns about this is because the drive exhibits I/O errors when trying to backup my NAS to it. The drive is formatted in HFS+. Previously, the drive was formatted as exFAT, and the volume could then not be mounted by macOS, but Disk Utility and diskutil could list the device. At that time, the same Eject \"issue\" as described above occurred. It didn't feel as if it was properly ejected since I heard it making sounds, and once macOS even complained about not ejecting properly even after pressing the Eject button and seeing it become grayed in Finder.\n\nA: This is completely normal and no issue to worry about.\nWhen you unmount a volume you are just removing the read and write access to it but the computer knows that the HD is still connected to your computer. You can always mount it again by clicking Disk Utility and click the volume and mount it.\nTo make the HD disappear from the list you have to physically remove it.\nThe reason the disk stays in the list is so that you can mount it if required, you can't mount anything the OS can't see.\n", "Q: Why hasn’t the size of my “Mail” folder reduced after upgrading to macOS High Sierra? During the WWDC 2017 keynote, it was mentioned Mail in macOS High Sierra would use up to 35% less storage space. An article on thenextweb.com also says: “After installing High Sierra, Mail will begin the arduous process of compressing every message it stores. When done, old messages will reportedly take up 35 percent less space on your computer.”\nHowever, despite having upgraded and having had Mail running continuously for over a day, I’m not seeing much, if any, reduction in the size of the “Mail” folder (inside the “Library” folder) as reported by the Info window in Finder. The window shows a total file size of 6.75GB with 6.87GB used on disk. Within a Time Machine backup from right before the upgrade, it’s 6.7GB with 6.9GB used on disk.\nWhy am I not seeing any reduction in the size of the folder? Is there something I need to do to get Mail to compress the messages? Or is this feature not available on all Macs?\n\nA: To not leave my own question unanswered: I haven't been able to find much information on this, so far I can only assume Mail's reduced storage space is one of the features that was announced but didn't make it into the final release of macOS High Sierra, or at least not in the initial 10.13.(0) version.\n", "Q: How can I get the original Sierra installer now that High Sierra is out? I can’t find the installer and presume Apple deleted the Mac OS Sierra installer from the app store search as well as our collective purchased apps pages.\nI'm running Sierra at the moment, and I upgraded from lion. \nHow can I get the previous Sierra installer now, in case my update to High Sierra goes wrong?\n\nA: If you downloaded the Sierra installer before using your Apple ID, you should be able to download it again using the Purchases tab in the Mac App Store. If the installer does not show up in that list, try downloading it directly from the Mac App Store.\nI do want to point out that it’s quite easy to reinstall macOS in case something goes wrong while updating. Just make sure you have a backup (e.g. with Time Machine) and you should be fine. In case something does go wrong, press and hold the power button to force you Mac to shutdown.

I have an iPhone 7 running iOS 11.0.1. I just started using TouchID to unlock the phone, and I've occasionally encountered an unexpected behavior.\nI thought that when pressing the home button it would unlock and go to the home screen, or last app. I have on multiple occasions pressed the home button to find myself at the lock screen, with the \"Press home to open\" message at the bottom, and the lock missing at the top. I can't seem to replicate this with any consistency.\nThe end result is exactly as if I pressed the hold button to wake the phone, and then touched the home button to unlock.\nIs there some specific way that I'm pressing the home button to cause this?\nI would prefer this behavior to opening to my last app because my natural grip on the phone makes it easier to press the home button than the hold button, and I like to check notifications on the lock screen.\n\nA: Are you using raise to wake? There is a timing that is difficult to duplicate, but can be repeated, where you can press the home button and raise to wake at the same time. The Touch ID unlocks the phone, but the wake seems to register from the raise instead of the home button press and so you stay on the lock screen instead of opening to the last app/home screen.\nIf you want the behavior of the phone being unlocked, but staying on the lock screen so you can look at your notifications, then just raise to wake, rest your finger on the home button, but don’t press until you’re ready to leave the lock screen. \n\nA: Ok first there are Two options to view your screen “not unlock” \nThe first one is raise to wake enabled here you view the screen by raising the phone and unlock with home botton.\nThe second is with raise to wake disabled here you view the screen with the first home botton click and unlock with the second. \nSo if you want to unlock the phone directly with one home botton click you must enable raise to wake in settings.\nI hope this finds you well.\n", "Q: Is there a \"permalink\" for Sierra at the App Store?

That way I can just run one process on one entire folder and get them all done quickly.\nI'm using Ubooquity to host my comics and it treats the files as corrupt if the _macosx file or any other hidden files are inside the zip file.\n\nA: Here is an Automator Service that uses as single Run Shell Script action to handle the process.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Automator, select: File > New > Service\n\n*Set: Service receives selected folders in Finder\n\n*Add a Run Shell Script Action\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings: Shell: /bin/bash and Pass input: as arguments\n\n*Replace all of the default code with the code show further below.\n\n\n*Save the Automator Service giving it an appropriate name, e.g.: Create CBZ Zip Archive\nNow in Finder, select the target folder(s) that you want an individual zip archive, with a .cbz extension for each selected folder, then right-click and select Create CBZ Zip Archive, from the services section of the context menu.\nCode for Run Shell Script Action:\nfor d in \"$@\"; do\n    if ! cd \"$(dirname \"$d\")\"; then exit; fi\n    if ! d=\"$(basename \"$d\")\"; then exit; fi\n    if [[ ! -e \"${d}.cbz\" ]]; then\n        if ! zip -r \"${d}.cbz\" \"$d\" -x \\*.DS_Store \\*.localized; then exit; fi\n    fi\ndone\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*As coded, it only creates the filename.cbz zip archive file if the file does not already exist.\n\n*It creates the filename.cbz zip archive file in the same folder containing the selected folder(s).\n\n*It's written in a manner that if an error occurs with any of the steps taken, it exits the script without notification. Error handling can be modified as needed/wanted.\n\n*By default, zip will not include the __MACOSX folder and if you find there are other hidden files besides .DS_Store and .localized, although you shouldn't run in to the latter in this use case, you can add additional exclusions to the zip command.\n\n*As is, the only indication the script has finished is when the Automator Service Gear Icon on the Menu bar has disappeared. Some other form(s) of completion notification can be added to the script and or the workflow of the Automator Service extended with additional actions as appropriate, needed/wanted.\n\n*As is, it's no frills, however it does what it's programed to do.\n\n", "Q: How do I bulk delete incompatible apps in iOS 11 I finally upgraded to iOS 11 and when I go to Settings > General > About > Applications I have 105 incompatible apps listed. \nIs there a way for me to delete all these in bulk? \nI really don't want to have to go and find these apps one by one to delete them!\n\nA: As far as I know, there's no button to simply \"Delete all 32-bit apps\", but you can delete large numbers of apps quite quickly using iTunes.\nThis won't work with the latest versions of iTunes (12.7+), so if you've updated you will need to download an older version.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your device next to the media type selection menu near the top of the screen.\n\n*Go to the Apps section.\n\n*For each app you would like to remove, click the X on its icon or find it in the list and click Remove. (iTunes won't show you which are incompatible there, but you can cross-reference with the list on your device and knock them out in a relatively speedy way.)\n\n*When you've finished, click the Apply button at the bottom right.\n\n\nA: Both iTunes 12.6.x and Apple Configurator allow management remotely from a computer. As suggested in timothymh's answer, but this is the perfect use case for the Offload Unused Apps feature.\nThis feature is designed to automatically remove apps you're not using. It's a low risk approach because even though the apps are removed, any documents and data are still kept in case you want to re-install the apps later (assuming they're still available/compatible).\nTo enable this feature, go to Settings > iTunes & App Stores and then swipe up to reveal the Offload Unused Apps option at the bottom. Tap the switch to enable it.\nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not exactly sure how this feature works when first enabled. More specifically, I don't know if once you've enabled it, it will wait a period of time to determine what apps you don't use, or whether it will check your past app usage to determine what you haven't been using.\n\n*If it was me, and just to be on the safe side, I would use your iPhone for a while before enabling this. Or, depending on the number of apps you have installed, spend a day or so making sure you've opened all of them up (at least the ones you want to keep) and then enable this option.\n\n\nA: If you have a Mac, you can download an app called ‘Apple Configurator 2’ where you can manage far more than you can/could in iTunes. Including bulk deleting apps. \n", "Q: Does Erase Disk delete the Recovery Partition? I was trying to reformat my Mac Mini Mid-2011, so I went to Disk Utility. I saw that there was a Recovery Partition. Then I did an Erase Disk, which I thought was only erased the main partition and would leave the Recovery Partition.\nThen I rebooted and held down cmd+R. The screen showed \"Starting Internet Recovery\", which means that my local Recovery Partition is gone, right? :(\nI was hoping to save time by using the local Recovery Partition instead of downloading from internet.\n\nA: When you want to reformat there are two things you can do, reformat the partition or reformat the drive. Or more properly \"Re-partitioning.\"\nIt is important when you don't want to do what you did (repartition the whole drive -or perhaps reformat both, not sure-) to select the \"Macintosh HD\" entry (or whatever your HD is called) on the left side of Disk Utility. \nNote that each drive has (at least) two entries. The physical drive and the partition (or partitions). Apple usually does not show the recovery or boot partition (grrr....). And if the discovery triangle is pointing right instead of down then you just see the drive and not the enclosed partition.\nYou can open disk utility safely and just look to see which is which and safely select either entry to see what options are available for each. The differences are subtle.\n", "Q: How to enable “Siri Knowledge” suggestion in Safari? This reddit post shows a new suggestion in Safari called “Siri Knowledge”, located above “Google Search”:\n\nHowever, it seems the post talks about beta version of iOS 11, and some commenters didn’t have this feature. On my iOS 11.0.1 on iPhone 6, I don’t see it too.\nWas this feature included in iOS 11 final release version, and, if yes, then how to enable it?\n\nA: On iOS11.1 you can control the display of “Siri Knowledge” in Safari by toggling:\nSettings->Safari->Safari Suggestions\n\n\nA: System Preferences -> Siri -> Siri Suggestions & Privacy, then check Safari. Tested under macOS 10.13\n", "Q: What is silhouette? I have a process called silhouette running on 10.13 (apparently the executable file is located in /usr/libexec/). It is extremely mysterious, I found no information whatsoever on the Internet regarding this process. Even databases of macOS processes would not mention it.\nThe CPU load of silhouette is extremely low, it would go totally unnoticed if not for one line in the Activity Monitor. It does not seem to establish network connections but I haven’t monitored it enough to be sure.\nWhat is this process and what is it doing?\n\nA: man silhouette reports (rather unhelpfully):\n\nsilhouette -- generate local topics on the device.\n\nThe daemon is launched by /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.coreparsec.silhouette.plist which is part of CoreParsec, the private framework that is part of Siri's backend.\nstrings /usr/libexec/silhouette yields a lot of method names related to machine learning: scoring bins, bloom filters, normalization routines, false positives, etc.\nAbsent further documentation from Apple, it's reasonable to conclude that this daemon is part of Siri's infrastructure.  \"Local topics\" has a specific meaning in machine learning (usually in context of clustering algorithms), though I'm not sure if it's being used in that context or not.\nIt is for sure not malware, if that's what you're concerned about.\n", "Q: How to choose GUID with High Sierra's Disk Utility? Most often USB flash drives on the market are pre-partitioned under (Windows) Master Boot Record.\nUntil El Capitan a special widget in Disk Utility made it possible to set the partition type to GUID.\nIn High Sierra there is a dedicated partition button, but it is greyed out. How can an alternative partition table be chosen?\n\nA: In Disk Utility, near the close/minimize/fullscreen buttons, you can see a \"View\" mode dropdown menu. Set the view mode to \"Show All Devices\", then you'll see the \"root\" drives. Click on a root drive, and then click on the \"Erase\" button.

In AppleScript, one can clear all notifications from all applications, like so:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"NotificationCenter\"\n        set numwins to (count windows)\n        repeat with i from numwins to 1 by -1\n            click button \"Close\" of window i\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n(Source)\nIs it possible to clear the notifications from a specific application? For example, the script should remove the notifications from Calendar.app, but leave those that are from Google Chrome on the screen.\n\nIt may be necessary to explain what I intend exactly when I say, \"clear.\" I am not trying to remove items from the list of notifications found in the \"Notification Center\" (i.e., the expandable vertical pane on the right side of the screen). I am trying to automate the action of pressing the \"Close\" buttons of the pop-up notifications that are superimposed in the top-right corner of the screen, so that these pop-up dialogs disappear from view.\nThis question concerns the \"Alert\" style of OS X notification (rather than the \"Banner\" style, which disappear on their own shortly after appearing).\n\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \n\n\nA: I tested the following example AppleScript code under macOS 10.12.5, and it closed the Alerts style messages from Calendar.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"NotificationCenter\"\n        set windowCount to count windows\n        repeat with i from windowCount to 1 by -1\n            if description of image 2 of window i is \"Calendar\" then\n                click button \"Close\" of window i\n            end if\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nNote: This is example AppleScript code which contains no error handling.

Mac OS is installed on both of drives but I use SSD as my system drive. \nToday I started to install the new macOS High Sierra on the SSD system drive and after the first reboot the Mac showed a progress bar that wasn’t moving for 15 minutes. So I made reset (holding power button). Now my MBP restarted from HDD and I can’t find my SSD in Disk Utility. It is hard to say how I am worried now about data stored on SSD. \nWhat should I do to finally boot from my SSD safely without loosing data? \nUpated: Disk Utility shows the SSD drive but it doesn’t show any logic drives here:\n\nAlso I found some restoring software that shows my drive structure:\n\n\nA: You should know that updating to High Sierra normally means to a change in the used disk format. (Apple introduced APFS for macOS High Sierra which will be used instead of HFS+). If you now updated the system on your SSD the SSD will probably be formatted as APFS and therefore the older version of OSX won't be able to read it's content.\nDid you apply any encryption on the SSD system? Because I had trouble with my system too when the update produced a unknown failure and I tried to access the system partition using an El Kapitan system. (I was forced to wipe all data and sync back my time machine backup)\nMaybe try to access the data by booting in recovery mode (because the recovery system should now also be upgraded to High Sierra)\n\nA: I don't know whether this will work or not but has I chance of working \nYou can make a image of your whole ssd by following this http://osxdaily.com/2012/05/23/create-disk-image-of-mac-hard-drive/\n", "Q: How can I change the list of \"Open With\" applications?

Dictation is the best transcriber I have found that will run on my MacBook (there exist others like PocketSphinx but this is no where near as accurate).\nHow can I use Dictation to transcribe audio files in batch?\n\nA: I just tried using eqMac with VLC. In VLC you can select which audio device to use for output in the audio menu.\nThen in the dictation settings you can select eqMac as the input and continue from there - as per the blog post mentioned in comments.\nFor batch processing, just have a VLC playlist of all your files and let it go. It will all go to one text file though.\nI tried out with some previous recordings and the recognition was poor. Hopefully that will improve with more articulate and clear speaking. \n\nA: You can use SFSpeechRecognizer (mirror) (requires macOS 10.15+): this is made for speech recognition and it's an SDK so you can write some code for batch processing.\n\nPerform speech recognition on live or prerecorded audio, receive transcriptions, alternative interpretations, and confidence levels of the results.\n\nNote that \nfrom https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/256/ (mirror):\n\n", "Q: Fan running almost constantly Quite recently, my late 2012 Mac Mini went from being virtually silent, to having the fan on quite hard nearly all the time, regardless what I'm doing. If I use some 3D rendering or similar then it understandably gets flat out, but if I am doing nothing at all the fan is still a constant whir. I am not using different applications to the past... basically browser and Parallels, but in my Parallels session all I run is RDP.\n\nChrome and related processes seem very high CPU% but I don't know if that's normal. \nI'm slightly worried my CPU being flat-out risks damage and also that electrical use is high. What can I do to identify and address this issue?\n\n\nA: I suspect that, for some reason, your system isn’t able to properly cool itself. I recommend trying to reapply thermal paste or bringing your Mac to an Apple Store so they can do it for you.\n", "Q: Built-in touchpad functional but not detected by System Preferences after installing macOS High Sierra I completely erased the HDD and reinstalled macOS (High Sierra), but the touchpad is not detected in System Preferences, which shows me the error \"No touchpad detected.\" \nThe touchpad is working though, I just can't use System Preferences to make any modifications to the settings. \n\nI yet again reinstalled it from a flash disk and have the same problem. \n\nA: As per the asker's comment:\n\nThis happens while laptop didn't have a battery installed , after installing the battery everything worked as normal .\n\nI had the same \"trackpad not found\" error on a MacBook Pro 13 inch mid-2010 running macOS 10.13 \"High Sierra\" and now 10.14 \"Mojave\" beta 2. I removed the 8-year-old battery because it swelled to the point the trackpad couldn't physically click. I reconnected the battery and the Trackpad preferences work again.\nI'm inclined to see if the hackintosh community has found any methods which  force the Trackpad preference pane to appear (e.g. fooling macOS into thinking there's a battery installed). If allowed by Ask Different, I'll update my answer with such workarounds.\nDigression:\nI consider this behavior a bug, because it wrongly assumes \"all MacBooks have batteries installed\". The presence of a battery doesn't indicate presence of a trackpad; the presence of a trackpad indicates presence of a trackpad.\nBut, Apple could argue that the user was warned by the sticker on the battery itself to not remove it; so what happens after removing or replacing it is somehow the user's responsibility.\nThe last MacBooks with removable batteries (2008 Unibody MacBook and MacBook Pro) were last supported by OS X 10.11 \"El Capitan\"; I do not know if it contains this bug; even if it did, it would not get fixed (10.11 now receives security updates only).\nThe only \"legitimate\" scenario I've thought of that would cause this issue is if the battery electronics, the logic board's battery circuitry, or the connections between the two are faulty, causing macOS to think there's no battery installed. As this scenario is unlikely (hopefully), I think the behavior of macOS is unlikely to be fixed.\n", "Q: enable spotlight web search a couple os versions back I disabled spotlight's web search with a terminal command and now I'd like to undo that but I can't figure out how to do that.

Is it possible for a mac to get infected by just visiting a URL?\nI was searching for someone's profile when suddenly the URL browser showed a couple of re-directions and then my macbook started beeping.\nEver since, the ActivityMonitor is also showing high cpu activity...\nI do not wish to download any mac cleaners or other software, but I wonder if I could check my mac myself to see if there is malicious software or something like that?\nAre there any folders I should look at to see if there is something in them that is not supposed to be there?\n\nA: Yes it’s possible, no it’s not likely. \nYou should do one of three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*get malware anti bytes for Mac and scan for malware\n\n*make your user non administrator if you might be browsing places you don’t trust\n\n*reinstall the os if you feel you are very compromised and possibly get help from someone on cleaning\n\n\nChances are, a reboot is all you need to do unless beeping and high cpu persist. \n", "Q: Looking for an App to manage Finder Tags I am looking for an user friendly App to manage the Finder tags, multiple file, intelligent tagging and so on.\nIs there anything like that?\n\nA: Ironic Software has several Apps which can do that, f.e. 'Yep' and 'Leap'. Take a look at their descriptions, both are Sierra-compatible.\n", "Q: How to link /usr/local to user specific directory? Is it possible to map the /usr/local/ path on MacOS to a directory that is unique for each user, for example ~/local/? Or is there another way to solve the following:\nI trying to give each user on my MacOS server a personal homebrew installation. However the disadvantage of installing homebrew in a non-standard user directory is that all packages will need to be rebuilt from source. Homebrew only uses the binary bottles for the default /usr/local dir.\nPreferably I would like each user to have a copy of homebrew in their home dir, and somehow map the /usr/local path to that directory so that the binaries still work. \n\nA: Yes, you can do it - but it is relatively involved.\nEssentially you could chroot each user into his own directory and replicate the filesystem in there, except for the /usr/local directory, which would then be user-specific.\nTo access the system directories inside the chroot, you could use bindfs, osxfs or even a NFS mount.\nFar easier to just let each user have a non-default homebrew and let them rebuild all their packages as needed. By definition, not sharing one folder implies duplicate storage and work but that’s likely far less hassle to set up. \n", "Q: Applescript error -1708 when calling a function I have written a script for Spotify with a subroutine\ntell application \"Spotify\"\n    ⋮\n    silentVolume(tmpDur)\n    ⋮\nend tell\n\non silentVolume(tmpDur)\n    tell application \"Spotify\"\n        ⋮\n        set tmpDur to ((duration of current track) / 1000)\n        ⋮\n    end tell\nend silentVolume\n\nTwo problems with this\n\n\n*\n\n*When I call silentVolume with a float I get an error -1708 and the error message (translated to English so this is an approximation) \"Spotify encountered an error.

When I tilt my MacBook, I can hear a moving object inside it (like a screw or grain). It should either be something that belongs inside and for some reason got loose, or something from the outside that entered the MacBook (via the fan?).\nI plan to go to an Apple Store to get it repaired, but is it an urgent issue? Could I damage parts inside my computer?\n\nA: If the object is metal, it has the potential to short circuit something and possibly cause an expensive repair, especially if it shorts the system board. Even if the object is not metal, if it can get in the fan it may have potential to damage it.\nI would immediately shutdown the computer and take it to an Apple Store or qualified repair center if you cannot investigate yourself.\n", "Q: Traces of Visual Studio for mac throughout macOS! I recently installed Visual Studio For Mac.

Visual studio was the only application I have ever downloaded from Microsoft.

On linux more -10 <file> displays only 10 lines at a time of file file. On a macOS Terminal, however, this does not work (for me). \nHow can I get this to work? Or how else can I get equivalent behaviour with less?\nI should say that I run OSX 10.12.5.\n\nA: less -10 <file> on macOS 10.13 also scrolls forward 10 lines at a time.  The major difference is that it fills the first screen, as opposed to more which only generates the specified number of lines even on the first screen.\nIf that's not acceptable, the LINES env variable can override the number of lines on the screen.  So something like \nenv LINES=10 less <file> \nwill force 10 lines on the first screen, and also scrolls forward 10 lines at a time.\n\nA: You can type 'head -10 filename'\nOR:\nYou can type more filename which will fill screen first time. After that type a number before hitting space to specify the number of lines on the 2nd scroll. You have to type a number each time to keep scrolling thru the file. \n\nA: more -10 is a GNU extension, not standard.  more -n 10 will work anywhere—whether with GNU more or BSD or any implementation of POSIX more.\nUse more -n 10 filename.\n", "Q: Cannot Add Internet Accounts I'm running OSX 10.12.6.

A Wikipedia page is pretty good at showing the precise date when a version of macOS was released.\nThe corresponding wikipedia page for MacPorts is not quite so helpful, and the MacPorts.org download page does not list any release dates.\nHow long has it typically taken historically (or for just El Capitan and Sierra) for MacPorts to catch up with the newest macOS.\nI got cornered with High Sierra and am trying to determine whether to keep H.S. and use another Mac while waiting, or to wipe it and downgrade to El Capitan or Sierra (and keep my fingers crossed that merely installing High Sierra has not already done irreversible changes to the Time Machine disk I used during install).\n\nA: Unclear exactly. You could try searching their GitHub repo for exactly when support was added, but because of the way it's laid out, good luck.\nHere's the best info I could get using The Wayback Machine as to when the release first crops up (not necessarily the actual release date):\n\n\n*\n\n*10.12: 3 days after release\n\n*10.11: 9 days after release\n\n*10.10: 4 days after release\n\n*10.9: 20 days after release\n\n*10.8: 1 day after release\n\n*10.7: 4 days after release\nPrior to this the capture points are too scattered to be useful.

The other night I wanted to install iOS 11 on my 6s+ overnight, but I had to accept the Terms of Service to do the installation.  I woke up at 5, had to be up by 5:45, and didn't want to miss out on 45 minutes of sleep. I did not want to start the installation for fear of my alarm not going off due to the update. When I was fumbling around with my phone I accidentally clicked the install option, which took me to the Accept Terms of Service screen. I tried to exit out of that screen, but couldn't. So I hit Decline. Now when I go to Settings -> General -> Software Update, it says my software is up to date (10.3.2). \nHow can I fix this situation and upgrade my iOS now? \n\nA: Just got off the phone with Apple Support:  Do a Forced Restart (hold power button & home button until Apple logo appears then release.)

The mini was running 10.13.3 and then upgraded to 10.13.4 and it will not login to the freenas server on my normal share.\nNeedless to say I have switched off all OS upgrades on the machine running 10.13.3. I can login to the Freenas from the mini if I use the guest account but I'd rather not use that.\n\nA: This is not longer an issue with Mac OS X 10.13.4. \n\nA: Yes, I was and am having similar issues.  \nI have a MacBookPro (macOS 10.13.6) trying to access file shares on a MacMini (also 10.13.6).  With SMB file sharing turned on, in Sharing Preferences on the MacMini (with or without AFP sharing on), double-clicking the MacMini from the Finder on the MacBookPro produces a \"Connecting... Not Connected\" message, and all attempts to \"Connect As\" fail.  If I turn SMB file sharing off, and AFP file sharing on, I connect fine: either manually, or automatically with my user name and password in the MacBookPro keychain.\nI have had this issue before macOS High Sierra, starting with perhaps 10.10 or 10.11.  I just turned off SMB sharing, and AFP worked fine.  Starting around then, the time to connect to the MacMini increased significantly (30+ seconds).  I could never isolate or fix the slow connecting problem.  In the past, I have had some luck connecting with my Apple ID instead of as a Registered User, but that doesn't seem to be working now.\nI am continuing to look for a solution to the problem, but you are not alone.\n", "Q: How to play music on iPhone via Apple Watch on watchOS 4? In watchOS 3 the 'Now Playing' complication played music on your phone when you pressed play, unless you changed audio source to the watch.\nIn watchOS 4 this defaults to the watch, and so far as I can tell there's no way to change it to the phone.\nIn practice this means that I will travel somewhere listening to music, arrive at my destination, do something else for a bit, then when leaving I press 'Play' on my watch and it starts a completely different album or playlist from the watch instead of continuing where the iPhone left off (the desired behaviour – and the default if I pressed 'Play' on the iPhone, or in watchOS 3).\nSince it's not an LTE watch, and it has very little storage on it for music, this change seems completely bizarre as it means that there's only a small selection of tracks to play ever.\nMy question: is there a way to disable this, and make the Watch start music via the iPhone instead of the Watch?\n\nA: Correct, with watchOS 3.x it was possible to use Apple Watch as a kind of remote for iPhone's Music.app:\n\n*\n\n*Browse all available music by artist/album/genre\n\n*Start/stop playback on your iPhone with Apple Watch\n\n*Change the music source from iPhone's storage to Apple Watch's storage\n\n\nAnswer\nUnfortunately, starting with watchOS 4, you can't browse music on your iPhone to start playing it using your Apple Watch.\nSee also Apple's Apple Watch User Guide on Music/Now Playing for using Music.app with watchOS 4.\n\n\nWorkaround\nYou may want to use this workaround:\n\nWhile watchOS 4 will no longer allow a user to browse their iPhone's\nmusic library, they can still use the Apple Watch to control it. In\nfact, it's now easier than ever: A \"Now Playing\" screen shows up by\ndefault when the user is playing music from their iPhone, giving quick\naccess to pause, skip a track, or adjust the volume with the Digital\nCrown.\nHowever, in order to take advantage of this, users must start the\nplayback of music on their iPhone, then continue controlling it via\nthe Apple Watch.\n\n\nA: I believe you are referring to the Music complication. Which is separated from the Now Playing in watchOS 4.\nThe solution is to use a dedicated Now Playing from now on. It can be also set as a complication which would allow easy access:\n\n\nA: The other workaround I found is using Siri. For some reason, if you go through Siri, the default is iPhone. \n", "Q: Is it possible to load an app onto an iOS 11 device using iTunes 12.6 or earlier? I have several older apps that are no longer offered in the app store. I am considering upgrading to iOS 11, but I am concerned that I will be unable to recover those apps should they be deleted from my iPhone (or should I lose it). \nMany of these apps, of course, are not 64-bit compatible, and therefore will never run under iOS 11 or later anyway. But of course apps vanish from the app store all the time, and I'm wondering whether the massive archive of iOS apps I have sitting on my hard drive becomes useless when I upgrade to iOS 11.\nI realize that iTunes 12.7 removes this capability, but I was hoping that I could just stay with 12.6, or, ideally, open 12.6 when I needed, even though 12.7 is installed.\nSo my question is: Is it possible to use iTunes 12.6 to load apps from my hard drive onto an iOS 11 device?\n\nA: There’s no need to specifically use iTunes v12.6 if all you want is to copy the iOS apps that you already have on your Mac to an iOS device: Apple’s support articles suggest this can still be done with iTunes v12.7. However, do keep in mind this only goes for the iOS apps you currently have on your Mac, it is not possible anymore to download other apps using the new iTunes.\nAccording to the Apple Support article “Changes in the new iTunes”, you can still copy any of the apps that you have in your iTunes Media folder to an iOS device:\n\nThe new iTunes focuses on music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, and audiobooks. Apps for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch are now exclusively available in the new App Store for iOS. […] You can find iOS apps, ringtones, and books (PC only) that you've already downloaded in your iTunes Media folder. If you have an iOS app, ringtone, or book that's no longer available for redownload, you can move that content to your iOS device while plugged in to a computer with a USB cable.\n\nThat last sentence links to another article that provides more detail:\n\nIf you have media on your computer that you can't redownload from the App Store or iTunes Store directly on your iOS device, such as custom ringtones or iOS apps, you can drag and drop the media from your computer to your iOS device using iTunes.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Connect your device to your computer.\n  \n*Open iTunes. Make sure that you have the latest version.\n  \n*On your computer, find the item you want to add to your device. If you're looking for Apps, Tones, or Books (for Windows) that previously appeared in your iTunes library, you can find them in your iTunes media folder.\n  \n*Drag the item from your computer to your iOS device in the left sidebar of iTunes.\n  \n\n", "Q: Searching by Finder Tags not working in Spotlight on macOS High Sierra I started using Finder Tags very extensively a while ago. However, I noticed this strange bug (at least on my macOS High Sierra): Searching for tags by writing\ntag:<name_of_tag>\n\nis not working for me in Spotlight.\nI can successfully write <name_of_tag> into Finder search window, and it will both recognize it as tag and show me the relevant files. Therefore, it looks like a bug specific to Spotlight, as searching for tags is supposed to work system-wide.\nIs there any workaround or fix for this issue?\n\nA: After searching the internet a little bit, I found a recent post in Apple Discussions explaining the reason for bug. In non-english versions of macOS (at least German and Slovak), searching by\ntag:<name_of_tag>\n\nquery does not work. Replacing the tag keyword by kMDItemUserTags fixes the problem and properly shows relevant files even from Spotlight:\nkMDItemUserTags:<name_of_tag>\n\n", "Q: Does a TIme Machine backup directory contain full or incremental data? I'm having trouble browsing another Time Machine disk. (The regular Time Machine interface doesn't show anything at all.) I can, however, browse the external Time Machine disk's directories. I plan to put the restored data on a second external drive.\nCan I restore the entire user folder from the last directory and feel that I've got all the files from the last time machine backup? Or are the contents in that directory an incremental backup?\n\nA: They're a full backup, in the sense that it contains everything that was in that directory when that snapshot was taken. But it's also sort-of incremental, in that for files (& entire directories) that didn't change between snapshots, it re-uses the same file/directory from the earlier snapshot via hard links.\nThis means there's only one copy of the unchanged item on the backup disk, but it's in each snapshot that it's valid for. Not just linked from each snapshot, actually in each snapshot. This can be rather hard to visualize, so just treat it as filesystem magic, and don't worry about it too much.\nNet result: you can make a Finder copy of the folder from backup, and it'll include everything. Caveat: Time Machine puts some special extended attributes and permissions on the backed-up files, and there's a possibility these might cause trouble. Unfortunately, I don't know the details here...\nAlso, please don't try to modify the backup (delete items, move/rename them, etc), of you may mess up the backup system's structure.\n", "Q: How do I transfer Phonegap app to my iPhone Apple removed the ability to transfer apps to your iPhone via iTunes, which is the workflow I was using before.\nWhat is the correct way to do it now? Is there some way in Xcode? I typically use a Windows machine for development (but have a Mac for certificate signing and other good stuff that Apple requires), so I'd prefer to not have to transfer my app over to the Mac machine in order to transfer it to my phone, but if I have to do that, I'm willing to.\nWhat is the current workflow?\n\nA: The easiest way is using a Mac.  Xcode (using the Devices window) can install ipa files on developer registered iOS devices.  The Apple Configurator 2 app (available from the Mac App store) will also allow you to select ipa files and install them (assuming they are provisioned correctly) on iOS devices.\nWithout a Mac, it may be possible to use an https service that allows downloading a correctly provisioned app (Ad Hoc or Enterprise) using a wireless installation manifest.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 won't show iOS11 update I'm trying to update my iPhone 5 from iOS 10.3.3 to iOS 11. But when I try to find the update, my phone tells me \n\nI tried iTunes too and it's behaving the same way. It's like I do have the latest version of iOS but I know it's not true. \nI tried turning my phone off and on but no joy. \nI haven't done a full restore yet because I'm trying to avoid that.  I have backed up my phone on my computer using iTunes, though. \nAny troubleshooting suggestions?\n\nA: Only the iPhone 5S model and newer can be updated to iOS 11. The 5 cannot run iOS 11.\n", "Q: Transfer photos from friends windows 10 pc to my iphone I am wanting to get photos that a friend has on their computer to transfer across to my iPhone. My friend does not use apple products and does not have iTunes, and I don't want to set up iTunes on their computer or wipe my existing information.\nany suggestions?\n\nA: You can try to sign in iCloud.com on your friend's computer, click on Photos icon, and upload photos to iCloud. Hours or days later it will sync with your iPhone if you connect WIFI. Then you can get photos to your iPhone without wiping any existing information.\n", "Q: Can't search for files on Mac with just file labels Since upgrading to MacOS High Sierra, I can't search for files using just labels anymore.\nFor instance, I created a folder called \"test\", containing a folder called \"folder\", with the red label (called \"Red\"). If I select the Red dot, then the folder does not appear. But if I search for the term \"folder\" or if I search for \"tag:Red\" then it will appear just fine.\nI've already tried resetting Spotlight by adding the folder, and even the entire drive, to Spotlight's Privacy tab, then removing it to force it to re-index. I indeed saw the re-indexing seem to take place, since the CPU on the mds processes spiked for about an hour.\n\n\n\nA: I encountered the same issue....it appears that in High Sierra, file labels are supplanted by tags. so, searching by tags, matching the name you gave the colored file label, will get the result you want (searching by file label seems broken)\n", "Q: Any way to temporarily allow insecure SSL on Safari in High Sierra? Apparently High Sierra has changed the way Safari handles untrusted SSL certificates.\nIn the past you could bypass an SSL warning and visit a site. But if you visited that site again in a new session, you'd get the warning again. \nBut now, asking Safari to allow you to visit a site with an untrusted certificate apparently requires that you add the untrusted certificate to the system trust store.\nTo me this is actually less secure. Here is just one scenario where there could be a problem: Suppose you're setting up a new server and, initially, it has a self-signed certificate. You know this is going to happen, but you have to get in to do some initial setup or testing. You bypass the SSL warning and go on your way. Now, later that day or the next day, you try to setup the server with a proper SSL certificate but somehow mess things up and your site is still serving its self-signed certificate. You visit the site in Safari and... everything looks good! No warning. So you're now confident that you setup your cert properly. But you haven't.\nYes, of course you can go into Keychain Access and manually remove the certificate, but that just seems to be not only many extra steps but also something easy to forget to do.\nSo my question is, is there a way to get Safari to temporarily, without adding anything to the system store, allow a connection to an untrusted SSL website, other than adding the certificate and then remembering to go manually remove it afterwards?\n\nA: Although there is no longer a button, you can still call CertificateWarningController.visitInsecureWebsiteWithTemporaryBypass() in the Safari Web Developer console to bypass the warning and visit the insecure site.\n\n\n*\n\n*If not enabled, go to Safari > Preferences > Advanced and select the \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" option at the bottom.\n\n\n*\n\n*Develop > Show Javascript Console.\n\n*Paste CertificateWarningController.visitInsecureWebsiteWithTemporaryBypass() in the console.\n\n*Press enter to run the code and bypass the warning page without adding the untrusted certificate to your keychain.\n\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to \"deep link\" to a specific email in mail.app on Mac OS X? For example, in a note-taking application like Evernote or an outliner, is it possible to create a link that will open a specific email in a specific folder in Mail.app on Max OS X?\n\nA: In OS X, you can use a URL of the format message:<MESSAGE-ID> to open the specific message in Mail.app.  So how do we find the message ID?  If the message includes a date or other \"data detector\", you can click the dotted line around that and add it to your calendar.  Then in Calendar.app, the newly created event will have a URL, which you can copy.\nA more convenient way is to use AppleScript.  Run the following code when you have the message selected in Mail.

Not a lot of experience with Photos.). Besides, the UI is beginning to feel a little... shall we say vintage?\nThat is what lead to rethink my position on sticking with Aperture. I'm currently considering moving all my files into Photos and just taking the hit in batch processing, file handling and editing capabilities. Before I make the move for good, however, I'd like to know if anyone has been in a similar situation and took a different path. If so for what reasons? What other software is there that can hold out as a standalone photo library and editing app?\n\nA: Photos\nI know the point of the question is an alternative, but I've been through both transitions: first iPhoto to Aperture, then Aperture to Photos. I think there's a few points still to be made for using Photos.\n\nalways-on sidebar\n\nI've always used the always-on sidebar instead of the toolbar since the very first version of Photos. Yes, the sidebar option was buried in the menus, but it was there and is much better than the toolbar. All that's happened in the most recent version is the removal of the (previously default) toolbar navigation and the activation of the existing sidebar option.\n\nmoments, still no user-defined events structure\n\nThis definitely was one of the things I worried about moving from Aperture to Photos. However, Albums works almost identically to Events, and I set up a smart folder looking for all photos not in an album as ‘Unorganised’ which lets me organise new photos into albums.\n\nlack of batch editing (still true except for rotating)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make adjustments to a photo.\n\n*Copy the photo adjustments using ⇧⌘C.\n\n*Select as many photos as you wish to batch apply the adjustments and paste using ⇧⌘V.\n\n\n\ncumbersome GPS tagging\n\nFeel free to expand on this one, but this is how I go for photos without GPS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select photos that need geolocation.\n\n*Get Info (⌘I).\n\n*Enter the location in the ‘Assign a Location’ field. The field accepts regular text search (uses Apple Maps) or latlong coords.\n\n\n\nmonolithic file structure (i.e. no referenced files in user-defined folder structure)\n\nStoring photos in the library definitely isn't required. Photos has full support for references files. When importing files, deselect ‘Copy items to the Photos library’ (this preference is remembered for next time).

MacPro5,1 firmware update (High Sierra) I've read quite some posts reg. eficheck; in itself it doesn't seem too \"worrying\" (for security reasons it's probably quite useful, but that's a bit off-topic here) \nI found this very interesting document here, which I unfortunately only understand partly (I suppose I could grasp it to 99%, but it'd take me 2 days - and maybe some others here already read this): https://duo.com/assets/ebooks/Duo-Labs-The-Apple-of-Your-EFI.pdf\nIn there it says: \"[...] there appears to be another level of checking that takes place within Apple’s pre-boot EFI environment that prevents rollback to an older version of EFI. \"\nAfter I update to High Sierra, will I be able to roll back, incl. the older firmware - just in case the newer firmware reveals some disadvantages later on?\n\nA: In general, no. Apple doesn’t release tools to reverse an EFI update publicly. In general, these aren’t needed since the drivers for GPU and other functional aspects of running the system exist at the OS level which you can revert to freely. Also, EFI updates now arrive with normal OS updates, so most people get these updates when you apply normal updates and not needing to run a separate EFI update.\nTechnically, Apple service providers can get access to tools to revert firmware but that is more geared to when an update hangs as opposed to there being a known regression. \nKnown regresssions generally are resolved with a newer patch on top, always advancing EFI versions as opposed to reverting. \nNow - hardware like the Mac Pro (Early 2009) may have other worries due to being classified Vintage and Obsolete products as defined by Apple: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624\nAlso - there is a nice paper by some long time Mac administrators that work for a security firm now with research on EFI updates and what happens without a check and users being shown when they are down level:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://duo.com/blog/the-apple-of-your-efi-mac-firmware-security-research\nIt's getting a fair bit of mainstream coverage - but the headlines there are a bit click bait / overblown in my experience so far. The risk to home users is very low and EFI is generally only needed to exploit systems when they are already running 10.12.6 and have all updates applied and you can grant local physical access by a skilled technician of the hardware that's being attacked.\n\nIn specific, the Mac Pro 5,1 is listed as never having an update in the DuoSec research paper  - so all this might be a moot point if all you care about is Mac Pro 5,1.\n", "Q: Can I split the screen vertically in iOS 11, on iPad?

It doesn’t seem to allow it. Is it not possible or am I missing a gesture?\n\nA: This is currently not possible — apps can only be placed to the left or right, not at the top or bottom, regardless of device orientation.\n\nDrag an app out of the Dock to make a Slide Over or drag it to the right or left edge of the screen to make a Split View\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Multitasking on your iPad\nYou do get to choose if you have the device in landscape mode or portrait mode so if you need to prioritize for extra height, you can.

It could also be as simple as the date / time are wrong on the Mac or some other thing that is breaking SSL/HTTPS/TLS or whatever secure connection the Mac is negotiating with the download server.\nIs there a reason you aren't using the App Store to do the download?

I have a 1.4 GHz iMac (8GB RAM and Intel HD Graphics 5000 1536 MB). Running a simple code or creating a level in Unreal Engine makes everything work very slow. The graphics performance is lagging behind a lot when editing a level in Unreal Engine plus the whole UI freezes and seems a little hazy or blurry with screen tearing.\nSo if I raid the HDD and external SSD together will it solve my graphics performance issue?\nI have already gone through this post (Would upgrading to SSD solve my performance issues?), but this guy has a MacBook so that doesn't answers my question!\nI don't have many options and I believe an external SSD would be the best solution.

Can I insert a CPU into the GPU case, and improve the overall performance of my iMac?\nAnd one more thing: Can I insert a processor into the eGPU enclosure in order to bypass my iMac's internal hardware such as the graphics card and the slow 1.4 GHz Intel processor?\n\nA: It depends by what you define as \"increased performance.\"\nAn SSD will increase performance with respect to getting digital assets off the drive and into memory and the CPU.  If you were having lag due to slow read/write times, an SSD will help.\nIf you have framerate issues, an SSD will do nothing to help your situation.  If your GPU chokes on 30 fps, it will still choke on 30 fps after an SSD upgrade.\n\nI have already gone through this post (Would upgrading to SSD solve my\n  performance issues?), but this guy has a MacBook so that doesn't\n  answers my question!\n\nTechnically speaking, that iMac is closer to a MacBook Pro than an actual desktop because it's using the Intel® Core™ i5-4260U Processor which is a processor aimed at the mobile (laptop) segment.\nThe HD5000 video chipset is shared video memory so even with 8GB RAM, you actually only have 6.5GB max available to you.\nThere's no amount of RAIDing or setting up external GPUs that's going to overcome this performance deficit.  This is like trying to supercharge a moped with the expectation it will haul freight.\nYour best option is to get the most powerful older Mac Pro with a proper GPU that you can afford rather than try and bodge a new iMac into something it really can't be.\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra: Create Windows bootable Usb I just install macOS High Sierra and Windows 10 through BootCamp Assistant.\nThe problem is that, Windows have a strange issue and I need a bootable USB to go to the recovery mode.\nI tried to make one from BootCamp Assistant but in the latest macOS the process is different and there is nowhere the \"Create a Windows 7 or later version install disk\" option and the only option I have is to remove the windows partion.\nSo, how I can make a Windows Bootable USB in macOS High Sierra?\n\nA: This can be done via console for Windows 10/11 iso images (Not sure about 8/7, but leave any comment if it worked for you).\nStart connecting your usb drive and type diskutil list to display all connected drives.\nYou'll see something like:\n/dev/disk0 (internal):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         500.0 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +500.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            185.7 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 47.1 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                512.8 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      4.3 GB     disk1s4\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.6 GB    disk2\n   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 LALA                    15.6 GB    disk2s1\n\nFor my case, the usb drive was /dev/disk2.

At the moment, I do not know of a method to change/overwrite this.\n\nA: Having tried all the available tools and generating 10s of unbootable Sticks, I finally created a Linux/Ubuntu bootable stick, which was trivial, and then, using the live Linux, created a bootable Windows USB Stick in no time.\n\nA: Hey guys I know this is an old topic but in case someone still looking for the solution. I found a way to edit the Boot camp assistant info.plist\nYou cannot alter info.plist if you are booted from the same hard drive. \nYou'll need a second partition with MacOS X installed. in my case I have two partition with High Siarra installed on both partition. and boot from the one you don't want to alter. in my case my second HDD. \nNow just open finder and navigate to the HDD you want to alter and just copy info.plist to Desktop and make a backup of it before you edit.\n now you can follow Bootcamp - No ISO Option \nNote: I try to edit with OS X default TextEdit but it doesn't work and I use sublime text, then it works fine. \n\nA: Boot Camp Assistant has been stable as always.

Here are a few tricks:\n\n\n*\n\n*The USB Flash drive must be formatted as exFAT\n\n*Make sure download the latest Windows Support Software\n\n*If there is not an AutoUnattend.xml at the top level of the drive, download AutoUnattend.xml, unzip it, and add it to the drive. AutoUnattend.xml provides the location of the $WinPEDriver$ folder to load the drivers during boot.\n\n\nIf this still fails, then here are a few good alternatives to Bootcamp for creating bootable USB on Mac:\nhttps://unetbootin.github.io/ (Free, Cross platform)\nhttps://www.balena.io/etcher/ (Free, Cross platform)\nhttps://www.uubyte.com/iso-editor.html (Freemium, Win & Mac)\n", "Q: How to stop Chrome from auto-opening App Store? Recently when I visited itunes.apple.com page for some app, Chrome asked me if I would allow opening the product in App Store.

Is there I way to turn this behaviour off?\nI tried searching in Google Chrome settings, but without success  (chrome://settings/handlers should obviously list these protocols and programs, but my list is empty).\n\nA: I have found the solution in this comment. The protocol handler in question is macappstores and it needs to be removed from Chrome's list of allowed protocols.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to solve it through UI, so manually editing of Chrome settings file is needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure Chrome is closed.\n\n*Open a Finder window and use the menu option Go → Go to Folder…\n\n*In the dialog that pops up paste in the path ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/ and click the Go button.\n\n*Now assuming you don't use profiles in Chrome you want to look for a folder called Default.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use profiles you will be looking for one probably titled Profile X where X is a number (if there are several of them, you must manually identify yours or perform steps below in each).\n\n*If you are logged in to Chrome with your Google account, your folder will be probably called Default, too (this was at least my experience).\n\n\n*In that folder you're looking for a file titled Preferences.\n\n*Open it in your preferred text editor (TextEdit is enough).\n\n*Search for the following text: \"macappstores\":false. The surrounding text should look similar to this (without newlines and indentation; I have added them just to prettify the text):\n\"protocol_handler\": {\n  \"excluded_schemes\": {\n    …\n    \"javascript\":true,\n    \"macappstores\":false,\n    \"view-source\":true,\n    …\n  }\n}\n\n\n*Delete text \"macappstores\":false, (note to also delete one comma!) and save file.\n\n*Done.

Trick was to do one install run that will definitely fail, but give you the prompt on the General Security tab to Allow Oracle Extensions.  Click the Allow option.  Then re-run the install again, should result in a successful install.\n\nA: High Sierra comes with a new security feature: Secure Kernel Extension Loading, which blocks kernel extension loading.

Went into Outlook and everything was there... my mail, iCloud calendar, and iCloud Contacts.  Success.\nNow, why did this work???  The ONLY thing I could think of was that, somehow, iCloud knew my old pst file was already connected to iCloud so it didn't offer the option to connect to outlook.

Please edit your question to indicate the specific Mac model you are working with.\n\nA: In very simple words. You need update .dmg file which is COMBO.\nApple has 2 types of updates Delta and Combo.\nDelta. You can only update Version +1. Ex . If you have 10.15.2 and you download 10.15.5, Mac will provide this error but it will allow if you download 10.15.3.\nCombo.

This works when your system isn’t bootable at all and much better than just a combo updater or the install app on your main OS.\n", "Q: Solid State Drive for small commercial print shop I do graphic designing, prepress & most of the file management at a small (2 owners – 5 employees) print shop. Although its not a huge operation, we're very busy and the iMac that I work on has taken a decent beating over the past few years, and definitely needs an upgrade because the performance of the HDD thats currently being used can be pretty bad at inconveniently random times. I use an SSD with my MacBook at home, and the performance between the two is always noticeable, so we're looking to get a SSD running on the iMac.\nMy question is, since we will have a lot of file reading/writing, and are constantly running relatively big applications like MS Office and the Adobe Suite, even though I'm intending on setting up a separate external drive for file storage, does anyone have experience with what SSDs perform best both in terms of longevity and speed in a commercial printing environment such as what I mentioned, and which perform best for Macs? We're also trying to keep the cost below $400 or so.\n\nA: I would suggest a Samsung 850 PRO. Great longevity, warranty and performance. Or, if you want a bigger drive, get the 850 EVO. Not so durable, but we're still talking of decades. \nThe Pro is rated for more writes than the Evo but costs more and has slightly higher benchmark performance. On an older iMac it’s not clear you’d benefit from the faster or more durable option.\nBasically: 1000 write cycles per cell for the EVO and 3000 for the PRO. If you write 10GB/day (which is quite a lot) on a 256GB EVO, the disk will die in about 70 years, when you'll have written 256x1000 GB of data.\n\nA: Get the $1799 stock 27 inch iMac you can, skip RAM upgrades initially, put in a 256 SSD and don’t look back. If you’re worried - bump up to the $1999 model with 256 SSD.\nYou can add aftermarket RAM later if needed for your specific workloads - you'll be able to see memory pressure in Activity Monitor and then see if you need to change default settings in Adobe or need to upgrade based on your file sizes. You can add external storage or have a network server for long term storage.\nApple’s SSD are the best in class and the 5k display are amazing for all sorts of prepress tasks. You can’t source equivalent options for twice the price as a small business or consumer.\nWe are rolling the mid line iMac with 256 SSD / 8 GB RAM for a large prepress installation and just finished deploying the first 50 to production on 10.12.6. The results are stunning - far faster than the max CPU/RAM MacPro for everything except dedicated 3D rendering and we’ll keep a dozen of the MacPro in a server room as render farms / nodes.\nEven with a full install of Adobe CS6 / CC 2014 / CC 2015 / CC 2017 on them to handle all clients - we’re not even 50% full on the SSD so we have a lot of room for fast local file storage for working files.\nFor normal prepress - the current iMac 27 is the best bang for the buck. Just be sure to get an Apple SSD / NVMe preferred on the latest model. It’s a huge step up in performance for Adobe and Office. I wouldn’t go to High Sierra for a few months until Adobe gives the green light on APFS.\n", "Q: How can I clean Unknown item of kind Unknown from my Account startup items system preference pane?

I was able to retrieve the 20 items only by running this code:\nlet loginItems: NSArray = LSSharedFileListCopySnapshot(loginItemsRef, nil).takeRetainedValue() as NSArray\n\n\n\n*\n\n*However the LSSharedFileListItemRemove method is deprecated and I can't remove them programmatically on High Sierra or later.\n\n*Furthermore, now when I click on hide in any of unknown login items, I get another unknown entry below duplicated. I had only one, but when clicked many times(not believing that such a bug can be in OS X) on hide/unhide I got 20 of them.

I finally managed to find a solution, thanks to a post I made on this Github issue. Try this solution.\nBasically you will want to remove the file $HOME/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm. Then reboot.\nNote that that this will remove all Login Items you currently have set up so be sure and make a note of all of the apps, volumes, etc. you currently have set to auto-launch at startup, because you will have to re-set them up. But this definitely got rid of all the \"Unknown\" items for me.\nThe other alternative is to set up a new user folder and migrate in your other files, but having a backup and erase install / migrating in from a backup is a great solution as well.\n", "Q: Can't install OS X on blank HDD on a Macbook Pro 2010 13\" - Stuck on white screen I have a 2010 MacBook Pro lying around that I wanted to revive.\nThe problem is that I've lost the original DVDs.

I'm looking for a solution where the image with its transparency will be available on the device as fast as possible.\n\nA: Any file transfer option that simply copies the file directly will suffice. This includes AirDrop and file syncing options such as Dropbox and Google Drive. I would personally recommend using AirDrop, as since it is transferred with a local ad-hoc Wi-Fi connection, it never needs to leave your local network and allows for fast transfer speeds of even very large files.

When I made the upgrade to High Sierra I reinstalled my MacBook from scratch. Since then the issue with the bookmark icons surfaced. The new tracking protections under privacy settings don't seem to cause the issue, since icons reload even when I turn them off.\nI tried deleting Safari .plist files in ~/Library/Preferences, deleting the ~/Library/Safari directory but to no avail.\nAlthough it's just a minor issue it's annoying and could burn a lot of data when I'm on the go and use my iPhone as mobile hotspot (from what I understand Safari loads the .png web app icons instead of the favicon.ico files which should be considerably larger in file size).\n\nA: I realise a \"me too\" is not helpful, but I wanted to keep the discussion alive. This is the first post I have found on this subject after several attempts. So, good to know I am not alone.\nUnfortunately, the answer from Geek is only a work-around. I work a lot on my Mac with a data plan and I like the favourites tiles / icons on my new tabs.\nHowever, this does not happen on all Macs. I have a much-older MacBook air where this does not happen in High Sierra, but on a more recent MacBook Air I do see this every time.\nThe main difference between these machines, is that the one that has this issue is configured as a work Domain account, or in other words, as a Mobile device.\n\nA: You can stop the loading of favicons after opening of safari by opening Safari then click on Safari in the menu bar, then click on Preferences then click on General then select  'New windows open with' and then customize it you can also customize 'New tabs open with' too.\n", "Q: How to prevent Numbers from changing currency automatically I have a spreadsheet that has cells with two currencies: USD and EUR.\nI have a cell that is a USD formatted cell and the other, a EUR cell.\nThe EUR cell values are results of the multiplication of the USD formatted cell values with a given figure as exchange rate.\nNow, Numbers does not let me manually change the EUR cell to EUR; when I click \"Cell\" -> Data Format -> \"Currency\" and chose a EUR, it reverts back to USD. \nI would like to have control over the currency to assign a specific cell as I used to prior to version 4.3 (5046) of Numbers.\nBecause most of my formulas are now broken as I can no longer make use of more than one currency.\n\nA: I have a similar problem which may be related. In my case Numbers 4.3 allows me to specify the ratio of two currency cells as a number or a percentage but then immediately and automatically reverts the cell back to the currency format of one of the origin cells. I agree that Apple Developers are probably trying to 'help' (but don't realise that they don't yet have the competence to do so infallibly). \nI have reported the problem via Apple's Feedback on:\n https://www.apple.com/feedback/numbers.html \nand suggest you do likewise. The more of us that report it the more likely they'll sort it. \nMeantime I have had to remove the currency format from my origin cells and added it to the description in the row/column headers. (Not ideal, I know.)\n\nA: I had the same issue in Numbers version 4.3. Setting the value of the exchange rate cell to target currency seemed to fix the issue. So, in my case I was converting USD to JPY. If the exchange rate cell was formatted as \"number,\" Numbers would revert the cell with the multiplication result to a USD format. But if I set the exchange rate cell format to \"Currency\" and JPY, I am then able to also set the format of the cell with the multiplication result to JPY.\n", "Q: How do I save the data from apps no longer supported by iOS 11? I have a lot of apps that no longer work in iOS 11, similar to Little Eden's question: How do I bulk delete incompatible apps in iOS 11, but my issue is not so much being able to bulk delete these apps (but that would be nice), it's the fact that many some of them contain data I can no longer access. \nHow do I retrieve this data? I don't mean encrypted data or anything fancy like that. I mean apps that contained data like word documents, excel spreadhseets, and PDFs.\n\nA: You should be able to use iTunes to save all the data from these apps after the fact, but it's far better to export and save off data before you upgrade since you can't restore a device back to iOS 10 to run the apps or check on what data you need.\nMore specifically - once you are on iOS 11:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your Mac or PC via USB cable\n\n*After a short while you'll see an icon appear that represents your iPhone - this should appear to the right of the drop-down menu (near top left of the iTunes window)\n\n*Click on the icon to view your iPhone's summary screen\n\n*In the left-hand pane of your iTunes window you'll see various options for your iPhone (e.g. Summary, Music, Movies, and so on)\n\n*Click on the File Sharing option (it should be the last one)\n\n*Now you'll see the File Sharing screen appear on the right-hand side of your iTunes window. This screen will list all apps that support file sharing.\n\n*Click on the app you want to save data from\n\n*On the right you'll now see a list of documents saved within this app on your iPhone\n\n\nNow you can save the documents you want by selecting them and clicking on the Save to... button at bottom right.\nNOTE: If you don't see the Save to... button at bottom right, scroll the window up so you can see it.\n\nA: The answer @Monomeeth provided is good for those apps that have been developed to transfer documents between your iPhone and your computer. Some apps however do not expose data created through the app this way. E.g. game settings or game scores may sometimes only be synced via the developer's systems or not at all. Some other apps might offer an export function, only offer emailing certain data or share it in other ways. Other apps again might not offer any export at all.\nMind you I have a number of apps that will not work in iOS 11 and that has actually prevented me yet from upgrading until I can safely get my data off. For instance, I installed Apple's Cards app back when it came out in 2011. It once allowed you to order printed cards with your photos on them. I still kept it for sentimental reasons. Stored on the app are all the cards that I previously created and sent, but there's unfortunately no way to get them \"out\" in any way other than \"screen shooting\" the inside, outside and the envelope.\n\n\n\n\nI also purchased the SnappyCam app back in 2013. The app allowed taking rapid bursts of photos before it became available in Apple's Camera app. The developer, John Papandriopoulos, was soon poached by Apple. Soon after that the SnappyCam app disappeared from the App Store, but the functionality wasn't there until the next iOS release. I kept the app because it was good. It allowed you to make GIFs and videos, among others. Now the time has come to delete it. SnappyCam's data was never available through iTunes. While SnappyCam's photos can be accessed through iTunes, you won't have the app functionality of course, such as creating animated GIFs or videos sequences. In this case it's better to use the app one final time to save all the GIF renditions and video sequences of the photos in there, if you hadn't done that already. \nSo, while the iTunes option might get you some data, it probably won't get all of the data off your iPhone or iPad. Also, note that the File Sharing option is as of iTunes 12.7, I think. AFAIK, before that it was called Apps.\n\n", "Q: Where to find model for downgrade.Is that GSM or Global?

Don't want any tactile/haptic feedback when clicking Can I completely disable the haptic feedback from my 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina's trackpad?\nI want to click without any kind of vibration/feedback.\nIdeally it should feel like (as I imagine it would were this disabled) pressing onto a solid bit of metal. I.e. the case surrounding the trackpad.\n\nA: I have a 12\" Macbook (2015) and a Macbook Pro (2017), both running MacOS 10.13.6. The 12\" gives me the option for \"Silent Clicking\" in Trackpad Preferences. The MBP, however, does not give me this option (and I wish it did). So, while it does seem to be capable of being switched off, there does seem to be some hardware-specific aspect to it. Silent mode is nice... wish they all did it.\n\nA: I think it's not possible to do using a \"normal\" way, it's restricted to the Service team only. Though it's possible ultimately, the motor probably needs software to tell it whenever to vibrate, it's just that the software is not accessible normally, I believe.\nBy the way, I current have the problerm, the Taptic motor stopped working but the 4 sensors still are working so I kind of using a \"TRUE solid-state\" trackpad, everything works except the Taptic, it's cool, I think it's the best \"issue\" you can ever get on your Mac, it feels great.\n\nA: You can't.  It's not a software controlled click, it's hardware.  You can use the \"tap to click\" gesture rather than a physical click.  Enable it in System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click tab.\nCredit: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3655934?start=0&tstart=0  @captfred\n", "Q: Mac Mail \"View as Icon\" missing in High Sierra? I upgraded to High Sierra and now the \"View as Icon\" option in Mail is no longer there.  Anyone know where it went? Is it gone for good :-(\n\nA: What I was told by my AppleCare chat was that tis is a \"Cosmetic Change: for Markup to work on attachments.

Give Apple feedback on you interest in having this restred.\nFound that if you drag the attachment icon within the new message window just a little bit, the \"View as Icon\" option will appear again when you right-click on the attachment.\n\nA: I found that in Sierra and Mail.app 10.3, even a one-page image would only attach as an icon, and could not be displayed in place. A workaround is to display the image on your computer, take a screenshot, and attach the screenshot to the email, which will display the image and not just the icon.\n", "Q: Will High Sierra also convert secondary drive into APFS during macOS upgrade process? I want to update macOS to High Sierra. This question is for precaution purpose before updating macOS.\nI have two drives : SSD-Primary and HDD-Secondary\nmacOS is installed in SSD and HDD is for backup purpose.\nWill High Sierra also convert secondary drive into APFS automatically, when I upgrade macOS to High Sierra installed on primary drive?\nShould I disconnect secondary drive before the upgrade?\n\nA: From the APFS Guide FAQ:\n\nHow do I upgrade to Apple File System?\nThe macOS High Sierra installer offers nondestructive in-place\n  upgrades from HFS+ to APFS for bootable volumes. You can use Disk\n  Utility to convert external volumes from HFS+ to APFS format.\n\n(Emphasis mine)\nYour secondary HDD is not a bootable volume (assuming it not a clone) so it will not convert unless you do so manually.\nThat doesn't mean your HDD can't use APFS.\n\nCan I boot macOS High Sierra from an APFS-formatted hard disk?\nYes. macOS High Sierra supports Apple File System for both bootable\n  and data volumes.\n\nYou will have to convert the second HDD after-the-fact.\nBut since you this question is getting info, (like you said) as a precaution, the best advice is to make a full backup before proceeding.\n\nA: I would check that both drives are backed up and then install the OS with your normal setup intact and all drives connected. This lets the scripts see all your apps and in case you store photos or other system / user files on the other drives, any migration steps can run on that data. \nAll Apple installs are now archive and upgrade where the installer runs pre-install checks, pre-install scripts, makes a new system and then runs migration and post install cleanup scripts to move all your settings to the new system. \nThe APFS conversion is only for SSD exclusive boot system drives and nothing else converts automatically for 10.13.0 release. Fusion drives and HDD stay on HFS+ for the initial fall 2017 builds of High Sierra. \nIf you’re not sure you’re ready for this full install, consider installing onto an external drive and testing. \n", "Q: How to reclaim free space partition on macOS High Sierra?

In MacOS High Sierra's Disk Utility, the partition is listed as Kernel Core Dump Storage (655MB). Its type is Apple_KernelCoreDump in the result of diskutil list. There is also a description, \"You can not remove this volume because the previous volume can not be resized.\" However, if the partition is simply a collection of core dump files, it should be safe to remove the partition.\nIt does not take too much space but it is in between some free space and the partition I want to increase its size. There is no other easy ways to resize it unless I remove the Apple_KernelCoreDump partition.\n\n\nA: I have finally taken the risk to delete Apple_KernelCoreDump partition. I did a full Time Machine backup in an external storage and then rebooted into recovery mode. From the Disk Utility there, I successfully deleted the Apple_KernelCoreDump partition in between two partitions. So far, there have been no problem.\n", "Q: Intermittent failure of certain keys to respond Came across the second MacBook Pro keyboard recently that exhibit very strange symptoms.\nCertain keys seem to stop responding despite being clean and traveling very easily just the rest of the keys. Both of them went to the Genius bar for testing, one of them for the 'long run', and came back as \"works normally\". Of course, despite still intermittently showing symptoms.\nThe affected keys in both cases were confined to the top row of letter characters on a qwerty-layout like tyuiop. Not always the same keys, not alway all keys. Sometimes all of them really do work normally.\nSearching around there are some similar problems reported, apparently mostly on Apple hardware. \nFirst port of call should be this Keyboard key stuck or not being recognized; how to fix but that reads like a permanent physical/electrical problem. And the supposed fix is really just an inconvenient workaround that further would be quite impractical to implement on that many keys.\nSearching some more similar symptoms are reported here\nKeyboard Intermittently Non Responsive - Top row of Qwerty only (This issue was not really solved…)\nqwerty row on macbook air won't work from time to time Also no solution but a lot of voodoo reasoning or observations.\nshift key + qwerty row of keys not working To look at similar but non-fruity situation.\nKeys qwer uiop Not Working, Rest Other keys Are Working Fine – Laptop, Desktop Linking the key failures to dirt.\nStrange symptoms with strange solutions that indicate a keyboard for itself may be fine: Unresponsive Keyboard and Trackpad problem\nBoth keyboards I examined had no spill related damage, both were cleaned underneath the key caps (minimal dirt there before), one I disassembled completely to really clean it. There is no swollen battery, no strange matter inside the machines.\nTwo further peculiarities to observe:\nPressing multiple (unresponsive) keys at once seems to yield a temporary relieve and the problems seem to be get more severe when the machine heats up and less severe when running cooler.\nWhat could be the cause of this? How to fix it?\n\nA: If you have this problem, prepare yourself for a long session of searches and partial answers. I wish Apple would summarize all the different possibilities in one page.\nIn my case, out went the \"p\" and then the ENTER key. (Survival trick: use the Keyboard Viewer to enter ENTER or any other key. If you are logged out I was not able to figure out how to enter \"p\" in my password using and ALT-### format ...).\nSo ... I did all the recommended resets (PRAM,SMC,safe mode reboot,upgrading to High Sierra). I checked that no System Settings were incorrect, added other language keyboards, upgraded to High Sierra. \nFinally, I decided to risk going with the tools for the first time into my keyboard, removed and cleaned the \"p\" with help of this YouTube video, the best among many I saw. (Note not all keys are created equal and that several articles say the control keys —SPACE, ENTER, SHIFT, ALT, OPTION— are harder to put back in as they have a pin). \nAnd ... nothing. \nOne article (which I cannot find now) had very useful pictures of the transparent film under the keys, which explains why keys that are in the same row tend to fail together. This film has gold conductive paint that follows a horizontal serial path on one side, so if there is corrosion or a mechanical problem in one key, it is likely to affect (or start affecting) keys in the same row, like when a bulb fails in a Christmas light with only two cables.\nAs the problem is intermittent, I discovered by chance that closing the lid, and putting the laptop vertically and putting pressure on both ends fixes the \"p\" and ENTER problems temporarily. I think my problem is the battery, which is 2-3 years old and at some point I've read that they start swelling.\n\nA: Not a fix but this worked for me.\nThe fault was that the qwerty row was sometimes dead and would require a number of key presses to get the key to work. Once it worked then it would continue working until the system went to sleep and then same problem again.\nFor me, bringing up the British on screen keyboard and leaving it open in the Dock has kept the keys working faultlessly. \nI have looked at many boards discussing this fault and all the 'experts' will not accept that it is a software fault and are telling all to fit new keyboards and io boards.\nI hope this works for those who need a quick work-around.\nGet it here:-\nGo to System Preferences > Keyboard.\nCheck the box that says \"Show keyboard and emoji viewers in menu bar.\"\nClick the icon in the Menu Bar with the Command (⌘) symbol in it, and choose \"Show Keyboard Viewer.\"\nThe keyboard will show up on your screen. Then move it to Dock or keep it tucked out of the way bottom right of screen.\n\nA: Ed Coombs' answer works for me too, not faultlessly though but much much better than without the keyboard viewer being 'live'.\nIf I had to guess, I would think that it is a hardware issue that has become a problem due to a software 'update' or program. The keyboard is 'polled' for input by the OS and where electromechanical 'tolerances' now fall outside the time allotted for 'responses' in the OS, the key press fails to be registered.\nI suspect that OS changes in timings or anti-spyware programs trapping key presses might produce the unintended consequence of unrecognised key presses. \nAdding the keyboard viewer clearly adds time as the viewer responds to keyboard presses - it may be that the OS takes the keyboard viewer key press rather than the keyboard input, so keyboard press > keyboard viewer > OS.\nOn the possibility that it is a 'timing' issue, before I found Ed's solution, my workaround was a more plodding deliberate style of typing - it worked but not well. \n\nA: Solution \nI've had this issue for years on my 2012 Macbook Pro that some keys on the right hand side of my Mac Pro keyboard would work on and off. Sometimes it would help to press them really hard, but sometimes they'd just be dead for days and then come back for no reason. The keys affected were = f12 [ ] right arrow and right command key, as well as all their shift functions. All the keys around them worked flawlessly. I just figured it must be a software issue, but I tried all the reset functions, restarting, etc. and the annoying thing is that it occasionally worked, but now I realize it was by chance, just from moving the laptop around. \nFinally figured out today that it was caused by the rear panel putting pressure on the optical drive. If I shook the laptop so that the optical drive fell away from the keyboard a little, it would work again, and if I put pressure on the rear panel in a certain area with my knee it would stop working. When I opened it up there was a certain pressure point on the optical drive that would make it stop working, and it was very sensitive to any pressure in that area. I fiddled around for a while and finally found a place where I could wedge a paperclip under the optical drive so that if the rear cover was screwed on again it would put pressure on the other end of the paperclip and wedge the optical drive towards the rear panel away from the keyboard. It took a few trials to find the right spot, in my case between the hard drive and the optical drive. Also had to wedge in a staple on the opposite end to limit movement of the optical drive. I didn't have to remove the optical drive or anything. I unplugged the laptop from the power cord and took care not to touch anything electrical, but not sure if there's a shock risk - had to see what worked and what didn't though. \nSo far so good, I finally have all my keys back. But a bit annoyed that it was so simple. I don't know if it would be a similar thing for the left keys or not, but many people have noticed that certain pressure points have an effect, so I would guess that the cause is usually mechanical. The rear panel on my laptop is pretty soft and easily compresses the components, which seem to easily interfere with the keyboard. \n", "Q: Boot Camp partition removal failed in macOS Sierra I installed Windows 10 on my Mac using Boot Camp Assistant, but later decided to remove the partition as I no longer needed Windows. I did (or tried to) using Boot Camp \"restore\", but it gave me an error saying it failed. Now when I go into Disk Utility, the Windows partition doesn't appear, so I can't delete it. But it's there somewhere because I'm only showing 180 GB on the Mac partition (not the full 250 GB). \nGoing back into Boot Camp Assistant doesn't help, it just allows an option to make another partition (no delete or restore option). \nI'm at a loss for how to proceed.\n\n\nA: After an unsuccessful Boot Camp Assistant “Remove Windows 10 or later version” execution, almost any CoreStorage partition I came across was FUBAR.

It's free, apparently well supported, actively developed and audited. They even have a canary online.\nEncFS seems currently not such a good option. But at least it was audited and the problems may have been rectified by now. EncFS works easy on Mac and Linux and restarted development this year. The wikipedia page about EncFS lists the features and Prism-Break recommends it now for both: Linux and macOS. Install EncfS via e.g. homebrew. A GUI-Wrapper increases the comfort (but the provided binary is unstable on 10.12+). For Nautilus integration have a look at EncFS easy, fast and reliable.\nIf integration into Finder is most important then you might stick with Filevault on the macOS side and try to teach your Ubuntu some new tricks regarding decrypting Filevault with libfvde. That should be available in your standard package repositories and is not that non standard in usage.\nlibfvde's support status is officially:\n\nlibfvde is a library to access FileVault Drive Encryption (FVDE) (or FileVault2) encrypted volumes.\nThe FVDE format is used by Mac OS X, as of Lion, to encrypt data on a storage media volume.\nProject information:\nStatus: experimental\nLicence: LGPLv3+\nSupported FileVault2 implementations:\nMac OS X Lion (10.7)\nMac OS X Mountain Lion (10.8)\nMac OS X Mavericks (10.9)\nMac OS X Yosemite (10.10)\nMac OS X El Capitan (10.11)\n\nBut that information might be outdated by now since there was a release just 4 days ago.\nFurther options might exit here: \"What are current cross-platform disk encryption options?\" Or just using encrypted archives like zip files.\n", "Q: --group-directories-first option for \"ls\" command I am using both Ubuntu 16.04 and OS X.\nalias ll='ls -Flh --group-directories-first'\n\nThis is an alias in my bashrc, but somehow --group-directories-first option got illegal in OS X after I upgraded my bash with Homebrew. In my Ubuntu desktop, I still can use that option.\nIn what version of Bash, the option is unsupported? The Bash version in my OS X machine says GNU bash, Version 4.4.12(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0)\nI would like to use --group-directories-first option again. Is there any way to achieve it?\n\nA: Install coreutils with Homebrew and alias ll to gls -Flh --group-directories-first instead.\n\n\n*\n\n*brew install coreutils installs GNU Coreutils, in case it is not installed.\n\n*Use alias ll='gls -Flh --group-directories-first' in .bashrc.\n(If you want to use the same .bashrc file in both operating systems, see below.)\n\n\nIn Ubuntu, ls is provided by GNU Coreutils, which Ubuntu always has. That's why ls supports --group-directories-first in Ubuntu. Probably you had been using the GNU Coreutils version of ls on macOS before, too, which Homebrew installs as gls but which can be made usable as ls in several ways.\nls is an external command, not a Bash builtin. Using a different version or build of Bash should not affect it. I'm not sure what happened when you upgraded Bash using Homebrew. Maybe more than Bash got upgraded too; maybe you had an ls shell function or alias defined in a global configuration file that was replaced; maybe you had a symbolic link ls that had pointed to gls and was overwritten; maybe you still have something like that but your $PATH has changed. Whatever happened, GNU Coreutils ls supports --group-directories-first, and switching to it (as I believe bmike is suggesting) should fix your problem.\nIf for some reason you want to use the exact same .bashrc file in both systems, there are a few possible approaches. You could create a symlink, wrapper script, shell function, or (because Bash alias expansion is nonrecursive) shell alias for gls in your Ubuntu system. But I suggest instead checking which OS is being used in .bashrc. Although you will get a different ll alias defined in each system, this approach has the benefit of being self-documenting. Your .bashrc will make sense to you in a year, or a month.\nif [ \"$OSTYPE\" == linux-gnu ]; then  # Is this the Ubuntu system?\n    alias ll='ls -Flh --group-directories-first'\nelse\n    alias ll='gls -Flh --group-directories-first'\nfi\n\nOr if you find you usually prefer to run the Coreutils ls, even if you're not using the ll alias, you can make ls an alias to gls:\nif [ \"$OSTYPE\" != linux-gnu ]; then  # Is this the macOS system?\n    alias ls=gls\nfi\n\nalias ll='ls -Flh --group-directories-first'\n\n(Thanks go to soroushjp for catching a mistake in an earlier version of that script.)\n", "Q: Manage external USB drive in iTunes as if it was an iPod Is there any way to manage an external USB drive in iTunes as if it was an iPod? Specifically, have it appear as a device in iTunes, and be able to specify which playlists, etc., should be synced to it.\nThe use case is managing a USB stick that I use in my car. Currently, I have a smart playlist that I want synced to it, and every time I want to make an update, I delete all the files on the USB stick and then copy the playlist over, which is far from ideal.\n\nA: The venerable Doug’s Scripts for iTunes has many AppleScript to export and export/convert songs in case you wanted them to be MP3 or re-encoded when you export them. Also available is an inexpensive app to automate this even better than the scripts:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://dougscripts.com/apps/m3unifyapp.php\n\nA: In the end I wrote my own solution for this, FlashTunes, which is now available on the app store.\nIt'll keep track of everything for you automatically, so you can just set it up once, and then every time you reconnect the device it'll figure out what to sync automatically, much like iTunes does for iPods.\nSee the demo here.\n", "Q: Force Airport Express to join 5GHz network I have an Airport Express 2nd Generation (Version 7.6.8) that I'm using as an access point for my desktop PC.\nMy house has a Technicolor DPC3848VE modem and WiFi router with dual-band network.\nI set the Airport express to connect to the 5GHz network (the networks have the same name + 2.4 or 5.0 for differentiating them).\nAll the connection is done without problems, but when I check the Network Icon in the Task Bar, the tooltip says I’m connected to the 2.4GHz network.\n\nJust to be sure I did a factory reset and connected the router again and it still connects me to the 2.4GHz network.\nHow can I fix this/force the airport to only use the 5GHz network?\n\nA: Your computer will use the wifi best suited under current reception characteristics. If you want to force your windows computer to only use the 5GHz wifi, you'll have to remove the 2.4 GHz from the known networks as for example detailed here for Windows 10 (which you appear to be using judging by your screenshot): http://www.ilovefreesoftware.com/24/windows-10/remove-saved-wi-fi-networks-windows-10.html\nWhat you could do is configure both wifi's with the same name and let your computer switch automatically (works way better when they have the same name), that way your laptop would choose the 5 GHz one when close enough to the Airport and choose the 2.4 GHz one when further away\n", "Q: Set SublimText 3 as default app for files without extension Files without extension always open in TextEdit ...\nI want them to open in SublimText 3\nI tried to change my com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist, but simply adding public.text did not work ...\n\nA: The solution was doing it with public.data\n\n*\n\n*Go to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices\n\n\n*Open com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist with Xcode\n\n\n*Add this :\n\n\n\n*Save & Reboot\n\n\nAnother way to do it\n\n*\n\n*Without Xcode\n\n*Working on macOS Mojave\n\n*With Sublime Text 4\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert binary plist to xml plist (for easy editing)\n\nplutil \\\n-convert xml1 \\\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist \\\n-o ~/Desktop/plist.xml\n\n\n\n*Open plist.xml (on your Desktop) with Sublime Text\n\nAdd inside <array>\n<dict>\n    <key>LSHandlerContentType</key>\n    <string>public.data</string>\n    <key>LSHandlerPreferredVersions</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>LSHandlerRoleAll</key>\n        <string>-</string>\n    </dict>\n    <key>LSHandlerRoleAll</key>\n    <string>com.sublimetext.4</string>\n</dict>\n\n\n\n*Convert back from XML to binary plist\n\nplutil \\\n-convert binary1 \\\n~/Desktop/plist.xml \\\n-o ~/Desktop/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist\n\n\n\n*Move the new com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist, from your Desktop to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/\nmv ~/Desktop/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist \\\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/\n\n\n\n*Reboot\n\nYou can also use Sublime package Plist Binary or BinaryPlist instead of manually converting from binary to XML\n\nA: Copy paste script (working with catalina):\ndefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.sublimetext.3;}' '{LSHandlerContentType=public.unix-executable;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.sublimetext.3;}'\n\nThis sets the default to Sublime Text 3.

How can I fix this?\n\nA: I have the same problem here. It seems to be a refresh problem. The file is actually there, it just doesn't show up. If I open a Finder window in the desktop folder the same problem happens. But I can verify it's a refresh problem because if I go to other folder and come back the file is already there. I have an iMac with a Fusion Drive. High Sierra doesn't convert it to the new APFS file system. I'm guessing it has something to do with that. My guess is that High Sierra is prepared for APFS and that APFS treats file refreshing differently from the earlier MacOS file system. So whatever signal it's expecting from the file system, it is not receiving.\n\nA: I've had this trouble as well. From what I can tell, it's a problem with how iCloud desktop works in High Sierra. Screenshots saved quickly to iCloud desktops in Sierra, but in High Sierra there's a lag when saving to any folder controlled by iCloud. Changing the file type when saving a screen capture from Grab made no difference, but saving to a non-iCloud folder worked instantly.\n\nA: I think somehow your screenshot location got changed to revert it back to the desktop typing defaults write com.apple.screencapture location Desktop\nThere’s also discussion on this issue that could be related to finder slow to refresh or alternate locations for screenshots. \n\n\n*\n\n*Capturing screenshots on macOS Sierra is very slow\n\n*Is there a way to refresh a Finder file listing?\nThe common thread is a third party sync or backup program like Google photos, box sync, Dropbox, etc...\n", "Q: Does OS X continue to copy files when my laptop goes to sleep?

At this point your question only describes the fact your laptop screen goes to sleep, but this is different from your computer actually going to sleep.\nRegardless of your settings and assuming your MacBook Pro has a continuous power source, then a system event such as copying a large amount of data will continue to occur even if various parts of your Mac go to sleep.1 This is because if your Mac is in the middle of an action such as copying files, it will not go entirely into sleep mode (e.g. your display may go to sleep, but your drives are still fully powered up for read/write purposes).\nIn terms of the speed at which data is transferred, this can be affected by a number of factors, but in your scenario the transfer rate should not be impacted.\nOf course, if you're copying a large amount of data, it is recommended you have your MacBook Pro plugged into an AC power source.\nFor more information on your Mac's sleep capabilities, you may want to refer to the following content:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Energy Saver settings on your Mac\n\n*macOS Sierra: Optimize energy settings for portable computers\n\n*About Wake on Demand and Bonjour Sleep Proxy\n\n1 This answer assumes we're talking about a Mac scheduled to go to sleep as a result of its Energy Saver settings, and not because it's been manually put to sleep by the user (e.g. by closing the lid, etc).\n", "Q: iMovie crashes on startup I've just installed iMovie from the App Store.

After that you can close the lid or move the iMovie to external display.\n\nA: Had this same issue when High Sierra first came out, Apple support talked me through SafeBoot (which I couldn't do because I use a firmware password) and opening iMovie in a new user account (which it did). After much fiddling around iMovie did work again, but I cannot say which part of the process made it work.\nToday iMovie doesn't work again, could be that the 10.13 update has broken it again.

This is picked in Mail > Preferences > someemailaccount > Mailbox Behaviours > Drafts Mailbox. \nI changed that to a local \"On My Mac\" setting.

Before today, with 10.12, and now (High Sierra 10.13), I had DestroyFVKeyOnStandby 1. With 10.12, I would open the lid to my laptop after it had been hibernating for a bit, hit the power button, and I would be prompted for 2 passwords (identical). I would enter the first password, a status bar would progress, and then I would be prompted for the second password.\nWith 10.13, everything is the same, but the first password prompt is missing. I always figured the status bar (in 10.12) meant it was decrypting the disk (or part of it). If that is the case, now it's decrypting before it even asks me for the one password to let me in. That is to say, there is the status bar, then the password prompt.\nAny clarity on why this might be different and if there is anything we should know would be appreciated.\nUPDATE\nAfter toggling DestroyFVKeyOnStandby and restarting a few times (ultimately, I changed nothing), the situation is as follows:\nAfter hibernating, I press power key, Apple logo appears, enter FileVault/Login PW, progress bar, finally desktop. This is the opposite of my previous situation [progress bar -> PW prompt]. Good, but still only one PW prompt. Why? My guess is the machine knows they are the same (set them at the same time)?\nI can now recreate my previous situation by setting DestroyFVKeyOnStandby  0(it wasn't 0 before). This is what 0 should do.\nAdditionally if I set DestroyFVKeyOnStandby 1 and turn off sleep-screen-lock, I am still prompted for a PW. This leads me to believe my machine is asking for my FileVault PW, the intended outcome.\nI guess my final advice would be to fiddle with your DestroyFVKeyOnStandby a bit and restart a few times. I know that's not very scientific, but it shouldn't hurt.\n\nA: Apparently removing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist, and then running an pmset -a DestroyFVKeyOnStandby 1 as Root has gotten things working reliably again. \nI have no idea what is causing this file to take precedence over the com.apple.PowerManagement.<UUID>.plist file again on every update, but it is rather annoying to have to remember to remove the non-UUID config file every time.\n", "Q: Can my laptop turn itself on after I've shut it down? I have a MacBook air, practically new, no problems until now.\nI usually just close the lid and the computer shuts itself down instead of entering sleep mode.\nFriday night, I shut my laptop down properly and didn't turn it on until this Monday afternoon.\nExcept I didn't turn it on - it was already on.\nIt was on, and very hot, and had a flashing file icon with a question mark.\nSo my question is\nHow could my laptop turn itself on, heat up, and fry my hard drive?\n\nA: At one time, I used to run a couple applications that would inhibit my iMac from going to sleep.  So, if you have something running in the background that stops your mac from sleeping, that would be a candidate.  If it woke up, you may have a backup while plugged in turned on.  That does wake the Mac while it does that trick.\nNow as for frying your HD?  Well, who knows.  Fried HDs do happen, and I suppose it could happen while a laptop is shutting down, which would answer both questions.  I did recently replace a HD on an older laptop.  \n", "Q: Add keyboard shortcut to print custom characters I would like to map the Alt (Option) + (a/u/o/s) to ä,ü,ö,ß \nIs there a native way, or a software for it?\n\nA: There's the default long press functionality, where you long press a letter (~2sec) and it gives you a tooltip with alternatives that are... I guess similar to that letter. You can then press the associated numbers to replace the original letter. \n\nYou can also navigate the list with:\n\n\n*\n\n*TAB and Shift + TAB\nand\n\n*← and → \n\n*Pressing Enter will replace the original letter.\n\n*Pressing Esc will cancel\n\n\n\nExample where I long pressed s\n \n\nExample where I long pressed o:\nI think it doesn't give me the ö, because that already exists in my keyboard layout as its own key.\n\n\nYou can adjust the delay for when the tooltip shows up here:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard (first tab) > Delay Until Repeat\nWhen Delay Until Repeat is set to Short, the delay is maybe half a second, if I had to guess.\n\n\nA: I use Ukelele which is a keyboard layout creator for mac.\nI'd recommend \"File > New from current input source...\"\n\nThen you can just hold down the ⌥ key and then double-click a key to change its output. Here you can paste your special characters.\n\nSave your new layout and move it to /Library/Keyboard Layouts/\nThen you should be able to choose it from your keyboard/input sources preferences\n\nA: I believe you should be able to do that under System Preferences/Keyboard and look for customizations.

If that's what you already have set, then go to Advanced > DNS, select each custom DNS server & hit the - key.\nThere is usually little point to using anything other than the DNS servers allocated by your ISP or any hotspot.

Use ‘tl’, ‘tr’, ‘bl’, ‘br’ for each corner respectively, and use -int 0 to disable that corner.\nTo find the integer for activating the hot corner of choice, make the change in System Preferences, then use defaults read com.apple.dock wvous-tl-corner.\nDon't forget to restart the Dock too after writing using defaults: killall Dock.\n\nA: Riffing on the excellent answer from @grg, you can loop over each corner like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nset -eu\n\n# Turn off hot-corners\nfor corner in tl tr br bl;\n  do\n    defaults write com.apple.dock \"wvous-$corner-corner\" -int 0\n  done\nkillall Dock\n\n", "Q: New iPhone 8 restore not showing sms messages My new iPhone 8 is not showing sms messages after a restore using itunes.\nCreated a backup of old iPhone 3G (ios 4.1) and restored it to new iPhone 8 (ios 11).

Is that gone, too? iPhone 6s after iOS 11 upgrade\n\nA: Source:\n\niOS 11 renamed the \"Do Not Disturb\" option for conversation threads to \"Hide Alerts,\" and the toggle is still accessible by hitting the information icon in the top right. But that's too many steps for some of us, so Apple added a shortcut to the swipe menu on the Messages homepage which quickly disables notifications for both individual and group chats whenever they get out of control. Just swipe left on any message thread to access the new \"Hide Alert\" shortcut.\nThe latter method is especially handy, as it can disable notifications from outside the conversation itself and prevents the \"Read\" receipt from being triggered, giving us plausible deniability with regards to reading any messages.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Just changed a password, not in my keychain?

Their age ratings are determined automatically by a questionnaire I answered concerning adult content (i.e. violence, drugs, etc.). I said \"No\" to each question since my app doesn't contain anything like that whatsoever. (It's a very plain music education app.) Apple does not allow you to just select an age rating like \"13+\".\nThe reviewer asked me to change my answers to that questionnaire so that the age rating would be higher. If I change my answers (to say, for example, that there is violent imagery in my app), then my answers would be false, which would violate the very Guideline Apple is saying I'm violating. This seems like a Catch-22, since the answers will either be false (since the app has no adult content), or they will reject the age rating.\nWhat should I do?\n\nEdit:\nHere are the answers I'm allowed to change. The truthful answer to all of them is \"No.\"\n\n\nA: Requests for changed metadata happen all the time.

The easiest fix might be to not ask for registration at all. Also, if you have any sort of web browser or user configurable internet search lookup or feeds, you’ll want to disclose you have unfiltered access to the internet. \nMy suspicion is you’re hung up on section 5.1 privacy. https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#privacy\nIn the end, you are correct that it’s your call on which you feel best serves your app - no sense compromising your answers if you’re certain that’s most important.\n\nA: My app was approved this morning. Here's the solution.\nThe \"Resolution Center\" allows you to reply directly to the app reviewer. This is what I wrote to them:\n\nThe \"Edit Rating\" menu does not allow developers to rate the app as\n  \"13+\". The menu only allows me to indicate whether it contains adult\n  content (such as violence, etc.), but my app does not contain any such\n  content at all. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I do not believe\n  that it is possible to rate the app for \"13+\" without incorrectly\n  stating that it contains violence or other such content.\nThe only reason I have age requirement built into the app's account\n  creation UI is to comply with COPPA regulations, which has nothing to\n  do with adult content.\nIf there is a way to rate this app as \"13+\" as you requested, without\n  wrongly stating that it contains violence or other such content,\n  please let me know.

I back my iPhone up to my Mac. Since I don't have much space on my Mac, I moved my iTunes backup folder to an external drive (copy and paste), and then created a symlink from the normal backup folder to the location on the external drive where that particular backup folder is located. I backed my iPhone up, and it seems to change the backup on the external drive (I can tell by looking at the date modified of the files in the backup folder). \nNow, there are two problems I've noticed with this. Firstly, when I connect my device and look in iTunes, it says \"Latest Backup: Your iPhone has never been backed up to this computer\" – even though it has been backed up (although to an external drive). The worse part is that the \"Restore Backup...\" button is grayed out, not allowing me to restore my iPhone from the backup.\nAnother thing I should mention is that when I go to iTunes > Preferences > Devices, I don't see my iPhone backup in the list. I was under the impression that symlinks worked on a low enough level such that applications like iTunes would be fooled into thinking they were on the main drive itself. That isn't the case though, apparently.\nSo, how do I restore my iPhone from my backup (other than perhaps buying a new Mac with a larger internal hard drive)? I hardly have enough space to move the device backup folder over to my main drive, so I'd like to leave that as a last option.\n\nA: I was unable to restore from this backup because I had symlinked the iPhone backup's individual folder,\nVolumes/External Drive/iPhone Backups/UF34...\n\ninto my Backups folder located at \n~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backups/.\n\nThis causes some issues. What you need to do is to symlink the backup folder into the MobileSync directory in your user folder. In other words, you need to create a symlink for the folder which contains all your iPhone backups (the folders with the weird numbers),\nVolumes/External Drive/iPhone Backups/Backups\n\ninside this folder on your disk\n~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/\n\nI believe you need to rename (or delete) the Backup directory which is already on your hard disk if you want to do this.\nI realize that this process might be slightly confusing if one has not used symlinks very often, so feel free to leave a comment here and I will try to make this answer clearer if I can.\n\nA: I've definitely seen issues with the symlink during the restore process in the past, but usually it happens mid-restore rather than not being allowed to restore at all. However I haven't checked much on this since the latest iTunes update.\nIf you navigate through the symlink in Finder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder, and select the \"Go\" menu at the top of the screen. Hold the Option key and select the \"Library\" menu option from the Go menu. (On OSX Lion and above, Library will only appear with the Option key held. On some Sierra configurations, Shift + Option may be needed to get the Library menu item to appear.)\n\n*From Library, navigate to Application Support > MobileSync > Backup.\nAre you able to reach your external drive and see the backup(s)?\nIf so, can you close iTunes and reopen it now and see if they backup(s) show up in Preferences > Devices?\n", "Q: Is there any Terminal command to find the files installed by a particular App?

Not sure you can make it look like the normal terminal one, but this might help folks that want to get rid of the key entirely.\niTerm2 > Preferences > Advanced > Experimental Features > \"Show key at cursor at password prompt\" => No\n\nA: Looking at the source code for iTerm2 it appears that this is a unicode character hard coded into the password prompt display code. At the time of writing, the relevant line the source code that displays this character is here.\nTo change the display character you would need to clone the github repository, modify the character on the aforementioned line and then compile iTerm2 from source. Not an impossible task if you're competent with Xcode. The project is well-organized and well-maintained so it's straight-forward to build it from source.\n", "Q: Vertical and horizontal workspace switching Mac has horizontal workspace switching, which is great. However, I find it very useful to have a 2D workspace grid (which I am used to from Linux) and I can switch both horizontally and vertically. Is there a way to do the same in Mac?\n\nA: Not really. The Apple window managers work side to side for space switching on both iOS and macOS. Same with the split screen control - only side to side movement is programmed.\nYou could get an alternative window manager, but you can probably get 90% of the benefit learning the key shortcuts to move quickly to a set screen and disabling the \"reorder spaces\" option in Mission control.\nI get why that's there for new users, but power users almost never want their spaces to be \"reorganized\" on the fly.\n", "Q: Does it make sense to turn a closed Mac upside down when it's hot? After some period of work with my MacBook Pro its bottom part can be hot. \nIf I want to take a break and close the Mac - does it make sense to turn it around - the bottom part will be on top. Is it better for the working of the fan?\nI have seen some users turn their notebooks around the way that the bottom part doesn't have contact with the surface anymore.\n\nA: There is no need to do anything special with regards to your Mac feeling hot. Your Mac's fans are managed by the System Management Controller (SMC) which will ensure that your CPU etc are protected in the event your Mac overheats to the point that it could cause damage.\nYour question doesn't actually specify what temperature your Mac is at, so it's impossible to comment on whether it's too high. However, MBP models usually range from about 40ºC (104ºF) to 100ºC (212ºF) depending on whether the CPU is idle or under load. CPU temps (just like ambient temperatures) typically have a bearing on GPU temps too, especially within the extremely confined spaces of a MacBook. \nIf you'd like, you can refer to the Intel Mac Temperature Database to see the various temperature ranges reported by users. You can also filter the list by model etc.\nIf you're still concerned, you can also Reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac to see if this has any noticeable impact on what you're experiencing.\n\nA: You are right about the metal MacBook Pro case running measurably cooler with room to breathe under high heat generation loads. I prefer to make a small air gap so the airflow out is still with the keyboard horizontal if you don't have a fancy horizontal or fancy vertical stand. Small air gap is a pencil or two under the back side if you have a stable desk.\n\nIf you do have a fancy vertical stand (twelve south), I've never been able to measure a temperature difference between having the hinge on the bottom or the hinge on the top. I also have never seen a case where simply having it horizontal on a flat surface overheated or damaged a Mac, but if I can keep it measurably cooler with a vertical case, I spend that money every time to be secure and tidy. \nNow that you're running in closed clamshell mode, the entire bottom surface is exposed to let radiation and convection remove as much heat as the ambient temperature can allow.\n", "Q: HIgh Sierra media(play) button changes After updating to High Sierra on my Mac, I realise that Apple had changed the media(play) button to unified all the media that playing everywhere including Safari webpage.

I am writing an Applescript for Spotify that is supposed to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log every new song played.\n\n*Every N seconds check what sound device is used.\n\n\nI do (1) by a simple loop that check how much of the track remains and then use that value in a delay statement in the loop (unnecessary to run the loop at full speed). However, N usually is much lower than the remaining time of the current track. Hence, I would like task (2) to run in a separate loop with N-0.5 as delay value. Basically I want to loops to run simultaneously from the same script. Is this possible?\n(Of course I could use two separate scripts but I need to distribute this solution when it is done, therefore less visual complexity - i.e., two scripts running simultaneously taking up space in Dock, needing to be launched etc - is better.)\n\nA: Not easily. The concept of processes and threads isn't contained in AppleScript. \nYou'll want another tool for that job. Swift might be a good one unless you're looking for python or something a bit more established.\n\nA: Language Limits\nAs of macOS 10.13, AppleScript does not trivially support multithreading within a single script. It appears possible to use NSThread within an AppleScript but this is complex and leads to a second limitation, that of the application being interacted with.\nApplication Limits\nIn addition to the AppleScript language itself not natively representing threads, the called application is unlikely to deal with AppleEvents in a thread optimal manner. AppleEvents are queued by macOS in a First-In First-Out (FIFO) order for processing by the application.\nThe application can defer responses to long running AppleEvents but this requires additional engineering that few applications implement. Most applications will block until the AppleEvent is processed before looking at the next AppleEvent.\nThis means a multi-threaded AppleScript talking to single application would likely not see the performance gains expected for the effort.\nSingle Event Loop?\nYou could approach the problem with a single loop dealing with multiple events. The single loop could sleep for N seconds, wake and deal with the pending appropriate tasks.\nPiyomaru's answer shows one way to implement an event based approach. This approach is not multi-threaded or parallel; it is an event driven loop.\n\nA: AppleScript now supports multi-threading (macOS 10.10 or later). And originally it has timer interrupt function since 1993 (on idle timer event handler works concurrently within single AppleScript).\nI wrote some AppleScripts with iTunes like you wrote. AppleScript can make delegates and receive other application's event.\nThis sample AppleScript can receive iTunes's playing state change. Once, the script run on Script Editor, it receive the change event of iTunes playing and displays name of track using macOS notification dialog.\n-- Created 2017-10-13 by Takaaki Naganoya\n-- 2017 Piyomaru Software\n\nuse AppleScript version \"2.4\"\nuse scripting additions\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse framework \"AppKit\"\n\nproperty NSDistributedNotificationCenter : a reference to current application's NSDistributedNotificationCenter\n\non run\n    NSDistributedNotificationCenter's defaultCenter()'s addObserver:me selector:\"statusChanged:\" |name|:\"com.apple.iTunes.playerInfo\" object:(missing value)\n\nend run\n\non statusChanged:sender\n    tell application id \"com.apple.iTunes\"\n        try\n            tell current track\n                set anAlbum to album\n                set aName to name\n                set anArtist to album artist\n                set aRating to rating\n            end tell\n        on error\n            return\n        end try\n    end tell\n    display notification aName\nend statusChanged:\n\nSo, the point is Spotify application can provide such a function like iTunes or not.\n\nA: I would suggest writing this in JavaScript rather than AppleScript. JavaScript is a supported language for Apple events scripting. JavaScript is single threaded, but it is a lot easier to write non-blocking asynchronous code.\nsetInterval(function() {\n    console.log('Do something in the closure function here');\n}, 3000);\n\n", "Q: Compatibility of NVMe and deep sleep in Macbook Pro Like many others in the community, I am running a Samsung NVMe drive in my Late 2013 15 inch Macbook Pro.

SIP should probably be re-eanbled after you have finished tweaking your system.\nWhat will be disabled is at first relatively easy to discern when just looking at the names of the culprits. But that can sometimes have quite unwelcome side-effects or unintended consequences.\nThese background processes are notoriously badly documented.\nFor example: disabling AiplayXPCHelper; that seems wholly superfluous but once disabled iTunes might refuse to even start. Gaining RAM and a few cycles from disabling one process might also be offset by many status and even error messages now written into your logs because certain Apple services try to communicate with others that are presumed to be 'there' but aren't. \nA good number of those processes are frankly just absolutely essential and needed for a system to run properly at all. Some can be disabled. So, yes, you can screw up your mac. That last sentence is important.\nHow to approach disabling features that seem unnecessary or are decidedly unwanted was described for example here.\nHave I said be careful yet? You have been warned.\nDocument your steps. Proceed slowly. Backup even more frequently than before.\nBe sure you are able to retrace your steps. Keep two different backups and a bootable installer handy.\nTherefore: deleting those plist files seems more thorough than just disabling them. Any space gained on disk is surely not worth it. But disabling is just so much easier to revert in case something goes wrong.\nAfter reminding you to be careful once more: just do not delete things from /usr/libexec !\n", "Q: Encrypt external USB thumb drive on MacOS High Sierra I'm unable to encrypt an USB thumb drive on MacOS High Sierra.

At this time it is not yet encrypted. Look at the list of disks diskutil list:\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *8.1 GB     disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS New Storage             7.7 GB     disk2s2\n\nStep 3: Now you see the \"New Storage\" partition with identifier disk2s2.

When you input a new username/password combination, Apple (macOS and iOS alike) asks if you want to save the password, also offering responses of “never” and “not now.” \nI understand the “save” response: the password is encrypted and stored in the keychain, and if iCloud is turned on, it syncs across devices. \nI understand the “not now” response: make the decision another time. \nWhat I don’t understand is the “never” response: The password, seemingly, has to be saved somewhere that the system can access it and, if it’s set to never, not prompt a “save password” dialogue after inputting it. Try a different username/password on the same website - you’ll see that it cues the dialog again, thus proving that it doesn’t save a list of websites. \nIs this accurate? Does Apple actually save passwords you told it not to save, and “never” really amounts to “don’t ask me again”?\nThe same question may be asked for credit cards on supported OS’s. \n\nA: It saves the site for which you don't want to save the password, not the password itself.\nYou can see the sites at:\nSafari->Preferences->Passwords\n", "Q: How do I handle (e.g. correctly escape) parens in a 'defaults write ...' key value? TL;DR\nIn defaults write <domain> <key> <value>, how do I provide a <value> that contains parens; i.e. \"round\" brackets, \"(\" and \")\" ?\nFull Bhoona\nI'm using defaults to redirect screen captures to a specific directory. That I can do fine, and have many times in the past, but I'm running into a problem when the target directory has parentheses in its pathname. So I'm doing something like:\n$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location <dirname-with-parens-in-it>\n\nand I'm getting an error of the form:\n<ba bla bla> Could not parse: <dirname-with-parens-in-it>.  Try single-quoting it.\n\nBut I get that despite trying all of the following (and a bunch more besides). In this, assume the name of the (pre-existing) directory in question is, literally, dirname(with)parens. My attempts and responses:\n$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location dirname\\(with\\)parens\n<bla bla bla> Could not parse: dirname(with)parens.  Try single-quoting it.\n\n$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location 'dirname\\(with\\)parens'\n<bla bla bla> Could not parse: dirname(with)parens.  Try single-quoting it.\n\nAnd I repeated both, three times each, replacing the single \\ with \\\\, \\\\\\, and \\\\\\\\. Same error.\nNotice however that the error does seem to suggest that the shell globbing itself is working fine, because 'defaults' is seeing the unescaped \"(\" and \")\" correctly. And if directory name/path contains not parens but rather whitespace, then a simple \\-escape works fine (as does quoting). Finally, I observe that for shell commands, like \"mkdir\", either of \\-escaping parens, or quoting them, also work:\n$ mkdir dirname\\(with\\)parens\n$ ls -ld dirname*\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 jonyive demigods  68 Oct  3 10:56 dirname(with)parens\n\nSo a likely suspect is defaults itself. man defaults doesn't offer much, saying only that says only that, \"value must be a property list, and must be enclosed in single quotes\". And even that's a lie. In practice it only must be in single quotes if it contains anything funky, and even there, if the funkiness is whitespace, \\-escaping will do. And of course, if the funkiness is parens, then not even single quoting appears to work.\nSo, any ideas? Thanks!\nP.S. I'm aware of and have used workarounds. For example, I can create a non-troublesome symlink to the parens-infested actual directory, and just give defaults the symlink as the <value>. But I'd really like to get to the bottom of this.\n\nA: To escape parens successfully in the defaults command you have to use quotes and inside the quotes single quotes:\nExample: \ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location \"'/Users/user/Desktop/(Screenshots)'\"\n\n", "Q: How can I delete all message attachments?

I see that Apple Supports iOS 11 on an iPhone 5s, but will I experience degraded performance if I upgrade?  \nThe effort to get iOS 11 onto my semi-antiquated phone will require a few hours to transfer pictures/music/etc. off prior to the upgrade and then bring it all back after the process is completed.  This is not a big deal if I'm not going to see any performance hits, so I'm hoping some other, more adventurous sole has taken the dive and can let me know if it's worth the jump or not.\n\nA: I own an iPhone 5S but I have not yet upgraded to iOS11. That is mainly because I like to let all the bugs get worked out first. Once it hits 11.1, I'll upgrade. However, to answer your question, take a look at this article that goes through a detailed evaluation of performance on the iPhone 5S. Overall, it doesn't seem to affect it to negatively.\nConclusion from the article:\nShould you update?\nI could understand wanting to hang around on iOS 10 if you have an iPhone 5S. Apple's oldest supported iPhone indisputably loses some of its pep in the move to iOS 11, and while it gets a lot of the same things as other newer devices, it does miss out on things like ARKit, the improved Siri voice, and some contextual Intelligence features.\nBut as I do every year, for most people I would come down in favor of updating. The iPhone 5S is slower with iOS 11, sure, but it's not as slow as the iPhone 4S was with iOS 8 or 9, or even as slow as the iPhone 5 is with iOS 10 most of the time. And as we mentioned, you still get a bunch of new iOS 11 features, and you're bound to find something worth upgrading for in that list.\nEven more importantly, though, you need to be on iOS 11 to get new security updates at this point. Apple only very, very rarely issues any kind of patch for older iOS versions after the newest one is out, so the first disclosed vulnerabilities that come to light after today are only going to get patched in iOS 11. Really, practically, you can probably afford to wait around until iOS 11.1 barring any major catastrophes—those updates usually come out toward the end of October—but in the long run it's not safe or responsible to use old unpatched operating systems indefinitely.\nSo, update. If not today, then soon. The iPhone 5S gets a little slower, but that's how it goes when the oldest hardware that runs an operating system is only 20 or 25 percent as fast as the most recent hardware. It'll never be as fast as it was, but it's fast enough for a budget or hand-me-down phone, and it keeps doing new things; that's an acceptable trade-off.\n", "Q: After Updating to High Sierra, my bluetooth headphones have terrible sound quality Also, I can no longer pause and play using the button on the headphones. \nThese are the Beats by Dre headphones that are included for students and educators.

The method documented here (right click on update, select Hide Update) no longer works.\nI have app Store version 2.2.1 (584), macOS Sierra version 10.12.6 (16G29).\n\nA: I was able to disable auto-updates by moving the app from the shared applications folder (/Applications) to my user-specific applications folder (/Users/$(whoami)/Applications). Apparently checks for updates aren't applied there, which sorta makes sense. I have yet to find relevant documentation on this though.\n\nA: You can write protect the application via Terminal like so:\nsudo chflags -R schg /Applications/Some.app\n\nWith this flag the app cannot even be modified by root. The AppStore will still attempt to update the application but lacks the permission to do so, resulting in the update hanging in the Updates section eternally. Furthermore, on every update attempt the AppStore will quit the app. So it might get annoying. In some cases this might still be the better option since updating an app can render it useless, as more and more developers make previously bought applications free and want you to subscribe for the features you already bought.\n\nA: Spotlight on macOS gathers information about apps wherever they reside and the App Store app consumes that information to decide which apps have updates available.\nMake a backup of the apps in question.

I often need to change the spelling language in OS X from English to Turkish and vice versa, how can I do it with an AppleScript?\nNote: I have read this question already, but in there, the answer suggests using Automatic by Language, which does not work properly, so I need to make these specific changes.\nI'm using a Mid-2015 MacBook Air with OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.\n\nA: The AppleScript code, below, employs UI Scripting and because a popup menu is involved, System Preferences will be made visible (activate) during the process. Had a popup menu not been involved, this could have been done without making it visible.\nThat said, technically it still can be done without making the primary window visible, but then all you would see is the popup menu flash for a moment on the screen. As this might be more of an annoyance, wondering what just flashed on the screen, showing the whole System Preferences window is probably less of an annoyance. You can see the difference and try it by commenting out activate, e.g. -- activate, and choose which you prefer.\nThe AppleScript code does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opens System Preferences to: Keyboard > Text\n\n*Changed the language in the Spelling: popup menu based on the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If set to Automatic by Language, changes it to U.S. English.\n\n*If set to U.S. English, changes it to Türkçe.\n\n*If set to Türkçe, changes it to U.S. English.\n\n\n*Closes System Preferences.\n\n\nEssentially, once it is not set to Automatic by Language, it then toggles between U.S. English and Türkçe. each time it's run.\nYou can save this as an AppleScript application, place it in the Dock, then each time it's clicked it will toggle between the two languages. (Once it's first set to one of the languages.)\nNote: Saved an AppleScript application it will need to be added to  System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility, adding the app to the Allow the apps below to control your computer list.\nThis also could be made into an Automator service, where a keyboard shortcut could be assigned. (See the directions at the end of this answer.)\nNote: The following AppleScript Code was tested under OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 and may need to be reworked for use with other versions of OS X/macOS.\nAppleScript Code:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    reveal anchor \"Text\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.keyboard\"\n    delay 0.5\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell pop up button 3 of tab group 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n            if (value) is \"U.S. English\" then\n                click\n                click menu item \"Türkçe\" of menu 1\n            else if (value) is \"Türkçe\" then\n                click\n                click menu item \"U.S. English\" of menu 1\n            else if (value) is \"Automatic by Language\" then\n                click\n                click menu item \"U.S. English\" of menu 1\n            end if\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\nNote: Because UI Scripting can sometimes be dependent on the timing of things, the value of the delay command may need to be adjusted and or additional delay commands may need to be added as/if necessary when run on your system. Make those changes as appropriate.\nAlso, if you want to make it just always toggle between the two languages, having already set it to one or the other under normal circumstances, you can remove the following lines of code from the if statement block in the script:\nelse if (value) is \"Automatic by Language\" then\n    click\n    click menu item \"U.S. English\" of menu 1\n\n\nTo use this AppleScript code as an Automator Service, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Automator, select: File > New > Service\n\n*Set: Service receives no input in any application\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript Action.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the lines containing (* Your script goes here *) and return input.\n\n*Paste in the AppleScript code within the on run handler.\n\n\n*Save the Automator Service, giving it an appropriate name, e.g.: Toggle Spelling Language\nIn System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > (Name You Gave The Service), you can add the keyboard shortcut to trigger this service.\n", "Q: AppleScript: \"tell me to quit\" - conditional on the environment? The \"tell me to quit\" statement is very useful when you run an applescript as an applet or from the script menu, however when developing or debugging scripts in Script Editor it is very annoying since it quits Script Editor rather than just stopping the execution of the script.\nTwo questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible from within a script to check what environment it runs in, something like\nif environment is applet then tell me to quit\nelse display notification \"Done\"\n\n*How do I exit just the script when it is run in Script Editor? That is, the same result as when you click the stop button in the toolbar.\n\nA: Current Application\nYou can get the name of the current application. If the name is Script Editor, then your AppleScript is being run within the editor:\ndisplay dialog (name of current application as text)\n\nDetecting the Environment\nAlternatively, your AppleScript can access environment variables through the system attribute command. You should be able to determine your process through this information. To see the HOME path environment, use:\ndisplay dialog (system attribute \"HOME\")\n\nStopping an AppleScript\nTo stop the script use the return command. In the AppleScript snippet below, the dialog is never displayed:\nreturn\ndisplay dialog \"Hello World\"\n\nreturn exits the current routine within AppleScript; much like return in other languages such as c. Called within the context of the main AppleScript routine, there is nothing to return to, so the script finishes.\nCompare this to tell me to quit, where the snippet causes a quit AppleEvent to be issued to the current process.\n", "Q: Photos unable to consolidate referenced photos I recently imported my Aperture library of 17,000 referenced images into Photos. Initially, they were referenced in Photos as well. Since I plan to upload my entire library to iCloud Photo library I told Photos to consolidate all 17,000 files. This revealed a problem. Photos is unable to locate and consolidate about a 1000 of my photos even though Aperture has no problem pointing me to them when hitting \"Show in Finder\".\nThe weird thing is, Photos offers me to locate these files for it. I then navigate to the exact folder where the file is stored and even made sure that its filename is identical to the name of the file Photos states it cannot find in that folder. At this point I'm stuck. What can I do to make Photos identify these files correctly?\nI'm happy to provide additional information if anyone tells me what might be relevant.\n\nA: For the record, although I was reluctant to try it at first, what eventually solved my problem, was to\n\n\n*\n\n*relocate all files into the Aperture library,\n\n*completely delete the Photos library,\n\n*reimport the Aperture library with all photos now managed.\n\n\nSteps 1 and 2 can run in parallel to save time. After doing this, Photos is now able to scan all 17,000 photos for faces and upload all of them to my iCloud Photo library.\n", "Q: iOS 4.1 sms messages database to iOS 11 I'm looking to restore my old messages to my new iPhone however when restoring from backup the messenger app stops working. Apple support say its the database that is corrupt. From looking at the .db files of 4.1 and 11 the schema is different.\nAre there any scripts/tools to move the old data into the newer format. I've tired 9 tools so far and they either cant read the old db or cant transfer them into the new one.\nOnly tool that comes close is icopybot, but I get an error constraint 2067 about 2 fields.\n\nA: You may want to try migrating the data on the phone to an intermediary iOS. For example, if you're starting with an iPhone 3G (which has a maximum iOS of 4), then upgrade that phone to an iPhone 4S, (which can be updated to a max of iOS 9).\nIf you're able to upgrade from iPhone 3G to 4S, then you'll have your text messages on iOS 9.3.5, which should definitely be upgradeable to iOS 11.\n", "Q: iPhone or Apple Watch as an external keyboard for an iPad I'm interested in using a 3rd party app (GoodNotes) for a presentation on my iPad. When a keyboard is connected to the iPad, clicking the right arrow will advance to the next page/slide.

Or, is there another way to control the iPad with an AppleWatch or iPhone?\nI've found one possible solution called WeBe++, but I would like to do this without jailbreaking the iPhone.\nI realize that many keyboard and mouse emulation apps are available, but these require a host application to be installed and therefore do not work on the iPad. They do work well between an iOS device and a Mac.\nIn case no solution to the above is available, I would consider other solutions that combine the AppleWatch and iPad, or iPhone and iPad. I also looked at PowerPoint and the WatchOS app, but it requires the iPhone to be the presenting device. I will need to the ability to draw on the iPad during the presentation with an Apple Pencil and I would like to save the notes after the presentation.\n\nA: In order to make an iPhone appear as a Bluetooth keyboard/mouse/HID you need to jailbreak it.

I tried to restart it several time and same issue. Then I googled and found that, I need to re-select startup disk and I followed the instructions but no luck.\nUnfortunately, I didn't backup machine because of space issues so no time machine option. :(\nI have 2 partitions, one for OS and one for Data.

During an update to High Sierra it just went into a reboot cycle, I'm fortunate enough to have access to another Mac so I target disked the iMac todo a backup just incase. I downloaded the Latest macOS via the App Store and created a bootable USB and then booted the iMac from that USB, started the Install wizard and just installed macOS 10.13.3 straight over the damaged OS and It worked, zero data loss and all apps work as they did before the failure.

I have a MacBook with an SSD, so space is limited. \nI've been using a single external drive to store my overflow, but would feel a lot more comfortable if it was on a RAID 1. So, I've bought an 2 bay USB 3 drive case, and an additional hard disk (same exact disk). What I want to do is create a RAID without having to the move the data on the external disk to a new temporary home, if at all possible.\nI have:\nDisk 1 - contains files.\nDisk 2 - empty.\nWhat I would like to be able to do, is create a new RAID 1, with Disk 2 as the only member.

Reformat Disk 1, add it to the Enclosure, and make it a member of the RAID, and have the OS silently replicate the data from Disk 2 to Disk 1, so that it becomes a mirrored set.\nIs this possible?\nOr do I need to find a 3rd disk to use as a holding area for all of this? \n\nA: The short answer is no. In any case you should place your data on a third drive, make your raid on drives 1 & 2, then copy data from drive 3 back to the new raid (drives 1&2).\nPlease note that even raids can (and will) fail too and you should keep a backup of the raid.\n", "Q: Changing Default Apache version on MacOS Sierra A DHS sweep of the network showed that one of the researchers Macs is running a non-safe version of Apache (2.4.25) and they would like him to update to at least 2.4.27.\nHe is having difficulty getting MacOS to use the new version of Apache rather than the one installed by default with Sierra.

Then you can run your own apache - whatever source and location and version you want. This is better than replacing the shipping version since each macOS update can and will change the build in version. Side loading your preferred source of apache guarantees it will last outside the Apple update process.

Every once in a while, my mouse cursor will stop for a second, or move extremely slow, every half minute or so.

I cannot for the life of me determine the source of this.\nI first noticed this when invoking 1Password Mini began producing a system bell tone. I finally started to dig into the problem today. In the Keyboard preference pane, there are no conflicts with the ⌘⌥\\ shortcut. So I disabled the shortcut in 1Password Mini. Tested, and system bell still sounds. When I attempted to re-add the shortcut, I get the following:\n\nTo be clear, this dialog displays when I carefully type ⌘⌥\\ — I am not typing ⌘C.\nSo something has apparently aliased ⌘⌥\\ as ⌘C. I have tested this further. If I highlight text, click on the Edit menu, and type ⌘⌥\\, I briefly see the Copy item flash, and text is copied to the clipboard.\nAny ideas? This is driving me nuts. I've quit all other applications, including menu items. I've checked the Keyboard Shortcuts preference pane for conflicts. And everything has come up short.\nUpdate: I've installed Key Codes from the App Store, and even this application indicates I'm pressing ⌘C!

An Alfred hotkey (Preferences => Features => File Search => Navigation => Previous Path [no wonder it was so difficult to find!]) was conflicting with the 1Password hotkey. As far as I can tell, there is no mechanism to uncover such conflicts other than by exhaustive search.\nAs far as I'm aware, the hotkey I use with 1Password is the default. I'm amazed this conflict doesn't seem to be more widely-known.\n\nA: I also noticed that the remapping happens because of alfred. For me there were actually two alfred actions that were set to ⌘ + ⌥ + \\:\n\n*\n\n*as mentioned: Preferences → Features → File Search → Navigation → Previous Path, but this for me did not cause the remapping, instead\n\n*Preferences → Features → Actions → General → Selection Hotkey was also set to the same combination and only when I deleted that hotkey it did revert back to the expected behavior.\n\n\nA: I'd try to see what really get pressed with the keyboard viewer.

The keyboard shortcut you're talking about is used in the accessibility preferences for Zoom (Turn image smoothing on / off).

I use spaces a lot and normally have my most-used apps open in specific spaces. One of these is Safari, which is set to always open in space 2 (out of 5). However, I often move Safari windows to different spaces as needed (for instance, if I'm going to use a website for reference while using an app that runs on space 4, I'll move the window with that website to space 4).\nI tend to leave Safari open when I turn my computer off; that way, I get back any windows and tabs which I was using in my last session and am likely to use again in my next session. However, when the computer starts up, sometimes some of the windows which were in different spaces go back to space 2. It doesn't happen always, and when it happens it only happens with some windows (so, for example, the window on space 1 will remain there but the windows on spaces 3-5 will have migrated to space 2).\n(I know that quitting Safari and reopening it causes all windows to go to the space where it's opened or where it's told to open in. I'm talking about Safari restarting by itself again after I've shut down or restarted the computer without having quit Safari, which normally puts windows in the spaces they were in before the computer was shut down or restarted.)\nDoes anyone know why this happens?\n\nA: The only thing that is supported is 'one app, one Space'.\nOnce you spread an app to more than one Space, results will be at best random. \nI would have expected that any relaunch, whether after reboot or not, would reduce your content to a single Space.

A printer is attached to Airport Express for (Airprint) printing facility.\nProblem:\nI am using the above set-up with the permission of IT (I am an external staff person who is not on their payroll). Recently IT has reached out to me saying that I need to remove my Airport Express because it is causing  interference to their devices and making them slow. Since Airport express broadcasts both on 2.4GHz and 5GHz, I was thinking as a possible solution I configure Airport Express to 5GHz only (less crowded spectrum). I think there is no possibility to restrict Airport Express to broadcast 5GHz network only (it will broadcast both 2.4GHz & 5GHz) therefore I was thinking to get a good value router/WiFi base station which has the capability broadcast only 5Ghz WiFi. I have looked up on internet and couldn't find any good value router which could serve the above purpose. My questions are \n1) Will the above proposed solution (5GHz network only) could resolve my interference woes? \n2) Please suggest an alternative (with specs) to Airport Express which could be roughly of same value and has the printer attachment capability and could broadcast 5GHz WiFi only.\nCaveat: I have already scanned the WiFi Spectrum 2.4GHz is very crowded therefore changing the channel wouldn't resolve it plus frequencies are overlapping, 5GHz spectrum is less crowded (only 1 more SSID other than mine is residing there, hence I want to broadcast only 5GHz radio frequency so that IT doesn't blame me that my device is interfering/crowding their 2.4 GHz spectrum) \nThank you!\n\nA: There is an app, WiFi Explorer, which shows all the networks your computer can see. It also shows the relative strengths and channel number of them. You could use this to determine that the problem is indeed 5 GHz. Maybe changing Airport channel will help. The app is not free and is available from the App Store.\n", "Q: Notifications from Apple TV on iPhone asking to allow login to Apple ID Got a 3rd gen Apple TV for my mom.

If you dont see a code on your Apple TV then the next best step for you is to go to http://www.appleid.apple.com and then sign in, get the code from one of your devices, then when in your account go under \"security\". In security look for two-factor authentication ON. If it is on, click edit on the far right hand side in security then you'll see \"turn off two-factor authentication\".\nYou'll want to turn it off in order to bypass the requesting of a code. Once you attempt to turn it off it'll ask you to create 3 security question (with answers) and double check your birthdate & rescue email (if you have one).\nOnce you've turned off two-factor authentication all of the devices that you are signed into will ask your to \"update\" your Apple ID by putting in your password to the account. It knows that you changed the security type to your account and wants to verify that you permitted it.

That's all good.\nQuestions I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will Target Display Mode attempt to use the GPU of the old Mac or use my MBP's GPU?\n\n*If I have to use a video card in the iMac, is there some other integrated graphics card on my iMac I can use and how do I disable the faulty AMD one? The AMD one sometimes (or rather most of the time) prevents the iMac from booting and sends it to an endless restart loop or hangs the machine in ever lasting suspension.\n\n*Assuming we get past the two above, anyone know of any easy solution so that I don't have to boot the iMac all the way and then use keyboard shortcuts to enable TDM?

In Mathematica, if I put the marker right next to a line of text and press Tab, the line indents, but if I mark a block of text and press Tab the whole text is replaces with an indent.\nI've tried different combinations like shift + Tab, option + Tab, none of them work.\n\nA: It's up to the app to support this. Pressing tab inserts a tab character, so if you have text selected, it will be replaced by the tab. The app must intercept the tab key and perform a special action of adding the tab to the start of each selected line.\nYou can quickly add a tab to the start of a line by moving the cursor to the start using ⌘← then pressing ⇥ to add the tab.\nYou can use a Keyboard Maestro macro to add block indent functionality to apps:\n\n", "Q: 'Add to home screen' website cannot access camera (iOS 11) We're facing the issue that websites that have been added to the home screen can't access the camera anymore with iOS 11.

I first freed up around 40 GB, which meant that I had 65 GB free, which was more than sufficient for Bootcamp.\nBootcamp runs, downloads the Windows support software, and says it's partitioning. Now, the problem is, the Bootcamp disappears while partitioning, and the system hangs completely. Only the cursor works. I can't even change the brightness. When I hard reboot, the system functions as normal, but in the Disk Utility, no space has even been allocated.\nLooking around on the Web and here, the same problem has been reported by a ton of people, but all of the answers are outdated, dating back to the age of Mountain Lion and Snow Leopard - \"simply partition a volume named BOOTCAMP of size 35-40 GB\", which simply doesn't work here.\nIf anybody could guide me towards setting up Windows, it would be really helpful.\n\nA: Never mind, figured it out. \nAsked the same question on Apple Communities, got an answer saying\n\nHi, \n  Bootcamp is not compatible (yet) with the new APFS shipped with High Sierra.\n\nWhich (probably) means that I'll have to wait for a new software update.\n", "Q: macOS changes screen arrangement when waking from sleep I have a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (MacBookPro13,3, 2016 - running 10.12.6 as it's a company laptop and I cannot update) with two monitors plugged in, each using a USB-C port (but using a USB-C to DisplayPort adapter for each). Whenever it wakes from sleep, the screen arrangement of these two monitors will have switched from what I set it as and I have to go into System Preferences and move them back to get my preferred arrangement back. Just to clarify - the cables have not been switched during this time.\nI feel like I remember reading about this issue a while ago on the MacBook Pro but cannot find anything about it. Does anyone have a solution?\n\nA: I have the same problem with my MBP running Mac OS 10.13.1. My non-Apple monitors are plugged into an OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock using USB-C to Display Port and Thunderbolt to Display Port cables. So far, the only solution I have come up with is to keep my monitors awake. I am using a black screen saver to make the monitors go dark after 10 minutes. While this is not ideal, it does solve the issue of the displays changing places.\n\nA: I was having this issue on my Mac Studio, with 3 LG monitors connected via Thunderbolt. Just got off the phone with Apple support. They were able to fix it by putting the computer into safe mode, then rebooting. To get into safe mode on an M1 Mac, hold the power button until you see the \"Options\" screen, then hold the left shift key and select your HD. Keep the shift key depressed until you see the login screen. We tested after returning to normal mode by repeatedly putting the Mac to sleep. The screens stopped moving around. Hope this works for you!\nUPDATE: It's happening again. Worked fine while Apple were on the line with me, walked away for 30 mins and came back to the same problem. Could be that putting it to sleep doesn't cause the issue but when it sleeps by itself it does. Another thing of interest is that I have a Cintiq tablet connected to the HDMI port. That never moves. So Thunderbolt could be a factor. Back on the phone with Apple.\n\nA: I've been having this problem too on my Mac mini with two monitors.  I have tried everything suggested in every post I've been able to find and none have worked consistently long term.  Yesterday I stumbled on a dumb solution that is working just fine.  When the Mac wakes and the screens are switched, I click the \"Cancel\" \"X\" at the bottom of the screen asking for the passcode.  this puts it back in sleep mode.  Then I hit the space bar to wake it again and it usually goes back to the original configuration.  A couple of times I have had to do this a second or third time to get it to switch but in every case it has been much easier than going through the multiple windows (more now with the latest iOS update) to rearrange them.  I still get all the open windows piled up on one screen so it isn't a perfect solution, just an easier hack to try.  I hope it works for you.\n\nA: On my M1 Mac mini with two monitors, all the windows on the extended display move to the main monitor after sleeping for at least 10 seconds, regardless of which monitor is the main display.\nI also had long call with Apple support yesterday and it seemed the problem was fixed by changing an HDMI-HDMI connection to HDM-DVI. However, I didn't wait long enough after forcing machine to sleep before waking it up. (It used to work fine on 2009 and 2012 Mac minis with mini display port and HDMI connections).\nBooting into Safe Mode did not help. However, sound output is now much louder - one bonus. Probably due to booting into Safe Mode because reconnecting HDMI-HDMI did not reduce the max volume.\nI called Apple Support again today and it was suggested I tick 'Displays have separate Spaces' in System Preferences->Mission Control (opposite to the solution to similar problems).\nThis seems to have worked - the machine has been asleep for a number of 'lengthy' periods and has woken up with all windows where I left them.\nUpdate - August 2022: this 'solution' did not last long.\n", "Q: How to run terminal commands when terminal itself isn't responding?

I'd like to send SIGCONT (kill -cont) to the Terminal app.\nIs there an alternative Terminal?\n\nA: No. When you’ve gotten a system in extreme and memory is fully committed, your only home is to ssh in remotely or get lucky with an app launch. \nYou might need to just power off the machine and pick up the pieces of lost and unsaved data as needed. \nUnless you have the shell already open, chances of spawning a new one are slim. \nForce quitting any non needed apps might also get you a narrow window to resume control. \n\nA: Ok found a fix. I copypaste Terminal.app, giving me two terminal apps.

I was really enjoying the smooth UI improvements in iOS 11.0.1, until I realized something: after the update, all my photos from October 2016 to the present are gone.\nToday I tried the 11.0.2 update, optimistic after reading a note that it fixes a problem where \"some\" photos may be \"hidden\" (haha on both counts--good joke, Apple!), but this did nothing--all these photos are deleted from my phone.\nI did backup the phone a couple of months ago, which I try to do fairly regularly, and thus have most of the photos on my laptop, but still lost 2 months' worth of pics.\nI can't imagine why Apple would allow an update like this into the wild. Do they not test for this scenario? Behind completely bricking someone's device, this has to be up there as one of the top things not to do when delivering a software upgrade.\nLooking at free space on the device, it's about ~5.5GB now, whereas before it couldn't have been more than 1-2GB.\nThat space had to have been my photos, so it would seem like they're simply gone. \nDoes anybody know if there's some trick setting or solution I need to use here?\n\nA: Apple didn't delete the photos, it may have optimized your phone's storage to free up space for the update.\nThose photos should still be on http://www.iCloud.com under your Apple ID account if everything in your iPhone's iCloud settings was setup properly.\n", "Q: Cmd+Tab with arrow keys So, I used to be able to cycle through apps back and forth by holding cmdtab while pressing left/right arrow keys.

I am doing development work. We have some test equipment that uses a self-generated SSL certificate. When I try to browse to the equipment in our lab, I get an error that \"this connection is not private\". However, the only 2 options available are \"Show details\" and \"Go Back\".\nShow details just lets me look at the info on the certificate, which shows all of the expected self-signed details.\nThere is no way to tell safari to acknowledge the error and continue onwards. At least not obviously. How do I bypass this error and continue onwards? I'm using safari 11, on OS X sierra.\n\nA: I found that after deleting the certificate, and then first opening a private Safari tab and proceeding worked. After it works on the private Safari tab it should work on the regular tab as well.\n\nA: For those who are having the issue where the warning page reloads over and over such as @brinkdad, check the details of the certificate from the page, then open Keychain Access and find the certificate and delete it. Refresh the page and proceed to access the website anyway. This should install the correct certificate to allow you to access the website.\n\nA: In my experience, Safari works fine, until it starts doing this. I've learned that once it starts, almost no page I visit is 'approved.' I'm not about to handle every page as a troubleshooting process to force Safari to do what it should do, normally. \nSo I just force quit Safari and relaunch it. Starts working fine, again. I've also noted I did not have this problem until I installed Wipr and some other ad block plugins that I had tried in the same time frame. So I turn Wipr Off when visiting sites I know might trigger the problem, but which did not previous to blockers.\n\nA: I tried all the answers here and was still in the infinite loop described by @brinkdad. I finally got it to work by going into Keychain Access, finding the certificate, right-click Get Info, expand Trust, changed the \"When using this certificate\" selection from \"Custom\" to \"Always Trust\".\n\n\nA: Press \"Show Details\", then press \"Visit this website\" on the bottom, and the \"Visit Website\" from the pop up.\nNote: if you're still getting this issue after installing the cert, try to edit in keychain access app: locate the cert that you just installed and double click to open the cert, expand \"Trust\" and change \"When using this certificate\" option to \"Always Trust\" close it and refresh the page again, it should work.\n\nA: From this Apple Discussion:\n\nThe issue could be about https vs. http, or similar Transport Layer Security URL. Unless it is your own bookmark (you could use http instead, without the expectation of security), there is little you can do about it. Often it is something the site owner must do to fix it (Revoked certificate/old certificate; Mix of https and http in a single webpage; etc.).\n\n", "Q: macOS: How to eject a remote disk?

I'm kind of worried about the macOS (10.13 High Sierra) installed on my computer. I restarted my computer because it was misbehaving with Reminders (I logged out and in to iCloud to see if Continuity would start working again and it caused some trouble). When the login window appeared I saw a Guest User which I had deactivated before. I then logged in and it was still disabled.

I have the same issue with High Sierra and the icon is corrupted too.\nMacOS has two types of a Guest user:\n\n*\n\n*An actual (but restricted) user account.\nIt can access files and apps, so it can’t be used on an encrypted disk.\n\n*A special mode that a computer reboots into.\nIt can only use Safari.\n\nFor some reason Guest user account shows up on the login screen even though it can’t log in due to encryption.\nI’ve just deleted the Guest account and it no longer shows up:\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal app\n\n\n*Paste this text:\nsudo dscl . delete /Users/Guest\n\n\n*Type Admin password and press Enter\n\nA: At least with 10.13.2, I found that disabling the guest account from System Preferences, rebooting, then re-enabling it does the trick.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro - How to resume APFS decryption process?

The detailed guideline along with new feature detail can be found here.\nNow, whenever you'll unlock volume the pending/paused encryption/decryption process will start automatically. But there is a condition, the machine (in my case, MacBook Pro) must should be plugged in. So, whenever you'll unplug the decryption process will stop immediately even if the battery is fully charged since this is presumably a maintenance task that shouldn't deplete the battery energy at any time.\n", "Q: Average photo size with iPhone SE How much MBs take an average iPhone SE Photo? I want to compare it with iPhone 5 file size.\nThe max storage for iPhone 5 was 64 GB, for iPhone SE its 128 GB. If the average file size are double as large as for iPhone 5 than it mean near the same amount of photos can be stored.\n\nA: In a highly unscientific test, I just took 24 varied photos (textures, objects, macro, landscape, etc.) with my iPhone SE, with Live Photos off, and found the average size to be about 2 MB.\nNOTE: my iPhone SE is running iOS 10, so is not using HEIC (High-Efficiency Image Codec) encoding, which can save approximately 50% of the file size without sacrificing quality.

The apps are Safari and Xcode, both are loading local files. I close both with the keyboard shortcut in the title but they always launch again at the next startup. My system is running Sierra\n\nA: The \"Command-Option-Q\" shortcut says in the menu \"Quit and Keep Windows\".

You can prevent an iPad app from being downloaded to an unjailbroken iPhone.  As mentioned in the comments, an iPhone app can run on an iPad in 'compatability mode'.  \nYour app should still look ok on an iPad unless your setting up autolayout constraints based on specific iPhone screen sizes.  One of the benefits of autolayout is that your app should be able to run on different screen sizes, including iPads.\nYou would need to indicate in the App Store description that this app is not designed to run properly on the iPad. I would recommend spending the time to make it look decent on the iPad knowing that people will still download it on their iPads regardless of what you state in the description.\n", "Q: How to connect an external display to a MacBook Pro Late 2016? I would like to connect an display (Dell LCD monitor P2715Q) to a MacBook Pro Late 2016.\nWhen connecting via USB and Mini DisplayPort, the display still says that there is no signal from the computer. I can't insert the CD that came with monitor since this model of MacBook doesn't have an optical drive.\nIs it driver issue (and where could I download them) or is it compatability issue?\n\nA: As I suspected, there is no such thing as a mDP to USB-C converter from Apple. You are using the Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter. It does not convert DisplayPort signals, only Thunderbolt.\n\nA: I helped a user with the exact same monitor last week. Assuming you have the correct cable/adapter, you need to press the MDP button on the side of the display, not the DP button. Once that was done, all started working properly.\n", "Q: iPhone 6s activation I want to use LTE network to activate an iPhone.\nHow much data volume is needed to activate an iPhone?\n\nA: The activation process itself uses less than a Megabyte of data.\nMore data may be necessary once you sign in to an iCloud account with a lot of stored photos.\n", "Q: Updating iOS through public WiFi in hotel Is it secure to update iOS when using public WiFi? Is there a chance the update is manipulated?\n\nA: iOS updates are cryptographically signed by Apple - one among a whole slew of integrity and security measures in iOS (PDF document, see section \"System Software Authorization\").  If something modifies the update over the air, the update will fail to validate, and iOS will not apply the update.\n", "Q: Touch Bar no longer allows for switching between media controls in High Sierra? Prior to updating to High Sierra, the touch bar would display any media that is currently playing (such as iTunes) and allow me to expand it and control it. \nAs I'm typing in Safari, the touch bar displays no options to control the music that is currently playing in iTunes. Obviously I could expand the control strip to display the play/pause button but previously the blank space would display the media.\nIt's annoying when you have two sources playing simultaneously such as iTunes and YouTube. Previously I could switch media control between the two of them so that when a YouTube video is playing I could pause iTunes from the touch bar without switching to the app. Currently there is no way to switch media control without having it in the active window more recently than all other media.\nIs this something others are experiencing or an issue with my machine?\n\nA: This has been fixed.

Also note that you will also need to order the 1mm metal contacts in order for the button to properly actuate the switch on the flex. \n", "Q: VirtualBox - Sharing a folder I'm a Windows 10 user, running macOS High Sierra 10.13 via VirtualBox 5.1.28.\nI didn't fully understand how to share a folder.\nThe part that I did understand and did, is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Devices → Insert Guest Additions CD image...\n\n*\nBut then, in macOS, I type in the terminal:\nsudo mount -t vboxsf release_builds ~/Downloads/SteamCMD-GUI\n\nAnd I get the error:\nmount: exec /Library/Filesystems/vboxsf.fs/Contents/Resources/mount_vboxsf for /Users/avi12/Downloads/SteamCMD-GUI: No such file or directory\n\nLater, I checked the directory /Library/Filesystems, and found that:\n\nWhich means that, there's actually no directory vboxsf.fs, so there would obviously be an error.\nThe question is then, what part am I missing?\n\nA: There are no guest additions for macOS in VirtualBox. The shared folder feature of VirtualBox won't work here.\nYou have to configure a share on the host system and access it from inside the guest with one of the common methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder > Go > Connect to server... cmdK\n\n*Terminal: mount -t smbfs //username:password@server/share .../mountpoint\n\n*Finder window > sidebar > Shared > choose share > \n\n\nSome network connection between host and guest is required (e.g NAT or bridged adapter). Using the latter requires to set up an IP-address in macOS in the same network as the host's adapter.\n\nTo set up a bridged adapter for a guest (which has to be shut down) do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose the VM > Settings > Network > Adapter 1 > Check Enable Network Adapter > Attached to > Bridged Adapter > choose a network interface of the host (usually either Ethernet or Wi-Fi)\n\n*Check the IP config of this interface in the host (e.g. IP= 192.168.0.2 Netmask= 255.255.255.0 Gateway=192.168.0.1 DNS=8.8.8.8)\n\n*Use the same config in the guest but choose a different IP (e.g. 192.168.0.111)\n\n*Connect from the guest to the host with cmdK > enter smb://192.168.0.2/Share_name > enter the credentials\n\n", "Q: Contacts.app: How to merge duplicate contacts?

This will have the same outcome locally: making them appear as a single entry. Any other devices which sync with the same services will need to be linked as well.\nSelect any duplicate contacts and use Card > Link Selected Cards (⇧⌘L). If at least two of the cards are in the same system, it appears as Merge and Link Selected Cards, and if they are all in the same system, it appears as Merge Selected Cards.\nIf you want all of your contacts to have all of their information held in a single service, you will need to export the contacts you want to move, delete them from Contacts, and then import them to the service you want them in.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install a ringtone on an iPhone using Garageband?

And now I can't get it to be recognized, and thus I can't access my data on what I rely on as an extra hard drive.\nI tried remounting via the Automator script in this post, but I see no effect.  I then tried pulling the card out & putting it back in, but to no avail.

Several hours ago Apple released a fix update for macOS that solves the issue with \"Vulnerability Exposes Password of Encrypted APFS Volumes in Plain Text\".\nMy question is:\nStraight when High Sierra became available I pulled the Installer (last icon in the bottom right corner).\nI assume that this files does NOT have recent patch included since it was downloaded before the fix was created / released. Now pretend that I will make a bootable USB flash drive and install this version of High Sierra in another MacBook. To get the fix I will pave to go to App Store and search for updates but what if (in theory) I won't have internet connection on that Mac?\nExact question:\nHow to always get installer with recent fixes? Should I remove that file from /Applications and re-download it each time new minor version (10.13.X) will be released?\nOn my main Mac I noticed that High Sierra is versioned as 10.13 but after installing the update the version stayed unchanged. It's not 10.13.1.\n\n\nA: You can't merge an update into an older macOS installer app easily. So you have to re-download the full installer to get the most current version. Check that you don't get the restricted (20 MB) installer only app.\nAfter downloading the first full installer (without installing it), move it to a folder and create a dmg choosing the folder (or alternatively zip the app).\nThen install the upgrade or trash the macOS installer.app.\nAfter Apple announces and publishes a new installer (not necessarily as a point release update), download it again. Repeat the steps above. If you don't need the old installer.dmg anymore, trash it. I usually keep them.\n\nUnder certain circumstances (often after moving the macOS installer.app to an arbitrary folder) downloading the new release will replace the old macOS installer in-place.\n\nTo check the build version grep the the file /Contents/Info.plist for DTSDKBuild:\ngrep DTSDKBuild -A1 .../Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\nThe golden master's build version was 17A362a.\nThe first installer's build version available to the public was 17A364.\nThe latest build version as of today is 17A400 (small installer) or 17A403 (large installer).\n", "Q: how to display 4:3 full screen game on widescreen monitor without stretching? I am playing the game Age of Empires 1 on Mac OS Sierra, running on a 11 inch macbook air connected to a 23-inch Acer monitor with native 1920 x 1080 resolution. The game is for Windows and doesn't have an official Mac version, so I am using a program called \"Porting Kit\" which appears to be some kind of Wrapper utility for Wine.\nThe game itself is 1024 x 768, so when I run it, my screen goes into full screen mode, but the 4:3 aspect ratio is stretched all over the screen, so the picture is shorter and fatter than it would be. I would very much prefer to play with black bars on the left side of the screen, so that the picture at least displays in the correct aspect ratio, not stretched.\nI found some forum threads where PC users with Nvidia cards had this problem, e.g. the thread here. However, my Macbook air, if I'm not mistaken, has Intel integrated video, so that doesn't apply.\nAlso, I tried changing the settings in the Mac OS display preferences, and hold Alt/Option while clicking \"scaled\" which gives a list of resolutions, including 1024x768. However, when I switch to that resolution, Mac OS also stretches. This is strange because I've seen screenshots of others' display preferences resolution list, and they have things like \"1024 x 768\" and \"1024 x 768 (stretched)\", e.g. two different versions, which implies the first one is \"unstretched\". However, my resolution list doesn't have the corresponding \"stretched\" versions, and unmarked one is stretched though. Strange.\nI also tried fiddling around with the hardware controls on my monitor (an Acer G236HL), i.e. the physical buttons near the power button on my monitor. There seems to be an option called \"Wide Mode\", which is set to \"Full\", but there seems to be no way to change it, although the interface suggests there are other options besides \"Full\", but trying to change that option results in nothing happening, e.g. there do not appear to be any other options.\nHow do I force my monitor to display a full-screen 4:3 picture with black bars on the two sides, rather than stretched? Again, the program I am using, \"Porting Kit\" by some guy named \"Paul the Tall\", doesn't appear to have any \"play in windowed\" mode feature. There appears to be a \"AOE rise of rome unofficial HD patch\" (also installed via Porting kit) made by yet another person that allows windowed mode, as well as widescreen resolution support. (edit update: for some reason, windowed mode using this patch crashes the game for me, but full screen mode works, and it allows playing the game in 1920 x 1080 resolution, so technically this is fine. However, I was wondering if there is a more general solution to this problem that can work for other full-screen 4:3 stretched games)\n\nA: Right-click the port in your Porting Kit library, press \"Wineskin Tools\" -> \"Launch Wineskin\". In the window that opens, press \"Screen Options\".\nSelect \"Override\" instead of \"Automatic\" in the top, then select \"Fullscreen\" in the left and choose the \"Resolution\" that you want to use below.\nAlso, that port uses Mac Driver, which is incompatible with the configurations above, so uncheck the \"Use Mac Driver instead of X11\" box. Be warned: the game was tested with Mac Driver and not X11, so it may not work if you disable that box. If it stops working, you can repeat the process and check that box again.\n\nA: If you have an AMD card with a 2017 software, you will have \"AMD Settings\" running. Open it (I have an easy accessible shortcut for it), click on the \"Display\" tab, click to Enable \"GPU Scaling\", then in \"Scaling Mode\" select \"Preserve Aspect Ratio\". That's it!\nIf later, viceversa, you have an action game that uses a low 4:3 resolution but could be stretched to the whole screen without altering the action or landscape ratio, do as above but in \"Scaling Mode\" select \"Full panel\" instead.\n[And no, I am not aware of any \"old way\" of doing the above via a command line: it would be easier, as it could be associated to the game shortcut using a simple script]\n", "Q: Reinstall iOS preserving apps and data Can I reinstall iOS (11) but preserve installed apps and data? I'm having some issues with my phone and I'd like to try reinstalling iOS but I'd rather not have to restore all of my apps and data as that would be slow.\n\nA: Yes. By doing an iCloud backup (not iTuens) you only preserve apps, data and most basic settings. Phone will look the same after you recover from an iCloud backup.\nDoing the same but with local Itunes backup will preserve absolutely Everything.\nTo reinstall ios on the iPhone you can either connect it to Itunes and do the procedure from there or directly on phone by going:\nSettings --> Generall --> Reset --> Erase all content and settings.\nUnfortunately this is not documented anywhere so i can not reference it but from personal experience this is my knowledge.\n\nA: Yes, please follow these steps to retain all your data after restoring a fresh copy of iOS 11:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: Go to Settings > iCloud and turn off \"Find My iPhone\".\n\n*Connect your iPhone to a computer running iTunes 12.7 using a Lightning cable.\n\n*iOS: Enable Airplane mode and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in Settings.\n\n*iTunes: Create an encrypted backup of your iPhone and verify that the process completed successfully.\n\n*iTunes: Select your iPhone and press \"Restore...\".

I wonder if you can give me some advice before I go and buy this super expensive SATA-to-USB Apple adapter.\nBest regards!\n\nA: you can put the old fusion drive in a usb enclosure then you should be able to boot to it by pressing the Option key when the boot chime rings. you can also use the drive in the enclosure to setup a new Mac. Using Migration Assistant you can import your entire old file system just as if you were using a Time Machine backup. The question of what to do with the drive AFTER you successfully accomplished moving your old file/apps/etc to the new Mac. All of a sudden you've got a 1.12TB or bigger drive on your hands.

If it is a song, and it is delayed for 0.5 or 1 second, it really does not matter.  What I am trying to find out is for games and videos. If there is a 0.5 second audio delay, for videos (movies or youtube if video/audio is unsync’ed) or for games, then it could be a bigger problem.\n\nA: Yes they have a delay, just as traditional headphones have a delay (albeit practically imperceptible). It's caused by both the digital to analogue conversion, as well as the variable amount of time it takes the signal to be transmitted and any interference present.\nIf you're using bluetooth headphones (airpods or otherwise) while playing video,  Apple and most manufacturers adjust the audio based on the latency so they remained synced. They also buffer all audio ahead a certain amount (when possible) to deal with small inconsistencies in the connection. \nAssuming the application is using Apple's native support for this, the latency correction is built in. Any time you see the iOS or macOS styled video player you don't have to worry. Applications with their own custom players will have to deal with this more manually, and so support is not guaranteed. (e.g. Youtube on Chrome in macOS has a barely-noticable audio lag). \nUnfortunately with games there isn't really anything they can do to make it better synced. Though since you probably have the device directly in front of you, you're in a pretty ideal position to limit any lag. At that point the amount of lag depends on the devices and distance/interference (which according to @bmike's answer, is pretty low for AirPods).\n\nA: Noticeable Delay When Using For Phone Calls.\nWatching YouTube videos and what not are okay, sometimes with a slight delay in movement of the lips with the audio you hear. That's annoying but less critical than the following. \nWhen making phone calls with the Airpods on an iPhone (in my case the Xs), there is a noticeable delay between what you say and when the receiver hears it. More than what you're typically used to with other headphones or through the built-in earpiece.\nOthers might not notice it but it's very obvious to me. That gap of silence between what you say and when they hear it is the cause of many awkward conversations where it feels like you're constantly cutting the other person off. You start talking but they hear silence for a fraction of a second, enough for them to continue on with their sentence. Then your voice comes in and they stop. And on and on it goes.\nI used to use my B&O headphones with the 3.5 mm jack in my old iPhone 6, but since \"upgrading\" to the iPhone Xs that doesn't have the 3.5 mm jack, I'm \"forced\" to use my Airpods over Bluetooth (unless I buy the Lightning to 3.5 mm adapter).\nIt's a big step backwards in quality for me. Not sure if other Bluetooth headphones handle this better but if Apple's own Airpods can't do it without a noticeable lag, I doubt others will be better.\nCurious to see if others have experienced the same thing and if it's perceptible to them as well.\n\nA: There is zero concern for music and videos since the system compensates for audio delay. Same for many games since as long as the visual and audio tracks start at the same time (buffering enough content for each to start and then hoping the new content delivery / creation can keep the buffer from emptying).\nNow, technically speaking, the laws of physics and the limited processing power of the CPU/chips that encode/decode the audio ensures there is a delay - but it's not on the order of a second. Subjectively, this isn’t a problem for me until I use airplay / WiFi and even then it’s nit horrible but the lag is noticeable. But I also can’t argue if someone else has a subjectively different experience and the lag isn’t acceptable to them. \nThe codec and stream of the bluetooth chips means that the sound needs to be buffered, encoded, transmitted, decoded and then sent through the amplifier.\nThere have been some nice attempts to scientifically measure this - http://stephencoyle.net/airpods/\nThe raw data says the measured latency of wired headphones is around 85 ms and AirPods are around 256 ms. My personal impression is the AirPods are more in the range of 120 ms delay and almost equivalent to wired earphones. Also, I'm fairly certain that Apple corrects for video playback if you use the API since I've never ever gotten the feeling that videos lag when switching from AirPods to EarPods and back on Apple devices and Apple audio devices.\nSame sort of synchronization is being done for the HomePod setup where millisecond sync and offset is going to be used to synchronize and phase the sounds for multiple bluetooth playback speakers spread around a room, but that's a far easier task where you can buffer all the sounds and then play a delayed and perfectly synchronous to the phase of the sound waves - as opposed to having a low latency audio interface.\nYou'll want custom hardware for that like the Universal Audio Arrow line of monitor hardware if you are performing live or making millisecond measurements.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.uaudio.com/audio-interfaces/arrow.html\nThe only case where I've seen lag as a legitimate problem is musicians with split second timing needs or scientific measurement apps. I've also heard of AirPods and iPhones needing a restore if they get stuck or some process is running amok and otherwise slowing down the processing of audio.\n", "Q: Automator: Select only one file out of many files in a folder. Script needed? I have a folder with different 100 rtf-text-files in a folder.\nI would like to have Automator to take the content of one text-file and send out it out via mail once a day to the same mailing-addresses - without sending the same text twice. \nBecause I am a newbie and don’t find a way to filter out only one rtf file with Automator’s predefined actions, I think I have to create a script.\nWhat I’ve got so far:\nNew Application:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find Finder-Item: I chose the folder with the files. Condition: File extension is rtf —> now I’ve got all (3 test-)rtf’s as result.\n\n\n(*)\n\n\n*Open Finder-Item: Open with default application\n\n*Get Contents of TextEdit Document\n\n*New Mail Message\n\n\nWhat this workflow does: It opens all rtf-files in TextEdit. Then a new Mail-Window opens and displays the content of the last opened textfile. Of cause it does’t send it.\nI think I have to include a step/script where the (*) is, so Automator has a specific rtf-file to pass to the next steps.\nCan you please help me to find this step or show me how to create a script? Or maybe you know another solution?\n\n\nA: When wanting to randomly choose from a group of files, to send the contents thereof as an email, while ensuring the content from each file is used only once, requires maintaining a list of filenames from which the content has already been sent. There are quite a few different ways this list can be created, accessed and maintained.\nStaying away from Automator and using AppleScript for the entire process, the easiest would be as an AppleScript property variable, however an AppleScript property variable gets reset if the script is recompiled in Script Editor and or saved again after it's been originally saved.\nThis is not necessarily a problem, if once the script has been properly configured to meet the needs and is functioning properly during testing, it is then saved as an application and not modified or saved again after the initial run of it having been saved as an application. If that might be an issue, then the list will need to be saved as a disk file. (Personally, I'd choose to use the disk file.)\nSaving the list of filenames from which the content has already been emailed as a disk file can also be done in a number of ways. You essentially need to pick one of the possible ways and code it accordingly.\nThe following AppleScript code examples, shows two ways to accomplish the overall task. The first, using an AppleScript property variable and the second using a disk file, to maintain the list.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: In one of my comments, I asked \"Do the files have to be Rich Text or can they be Plain Text?\", and the reason for this is, as Plain Text the file would not need to be opened in the GUI to retrieve the contents, where as with Rich Text it would need to be opened in .e.g. TextEdit to retrieve the contents. Not having to do it through the GUI is faster and visually less obtrusive. Also, if this is done in Automator using the Get Contents of TextEdit Document action, it retrieves the contents as plain text anyway. So, it is actually advantageous to use Plain Text files over Rich Text to begin with. These examples are coded to use Rich Text and TextEdit, with a modification shown afterwards if using Plain Text.\n\n\nIn the first example AppleScript code, there are some variables which you'll need to set:\n\n\n*\n\n*thisFolder - The location of the folder containing the 100 files.\n\n*theRecipientName - The Name of the Email Recipient.\n\n*theRecipientAddress - The Email Address of the Email Recipient.\n\n*theSubject - The Subject of the Email Message.\n\n\nIn the second example AppleScript code, in addition to the variables shown above:\n\n\n*\n\n*theAlreadySentListFilename - The location and name of the file containing the filenames from which the content has already been sent.\n\n\nThe remainder of the script is coded in a manner (tokenized) to work with these variables and others set within the script. Also, the tell application \"Mail\" block of code is coded to send the message automatically, however it has been commented out, until testing is done and or if not wanting to automatically send. Uncomment accordingly.\nTo use this script, in Script Editor, create a new document and save it as an application in /Applications, naming it as, e.g. 100 Messages to Send.app. \nNext, copy and paste the example AppleScript code below into the 100 Messages to Send.app in Script Editor and hit the Compile button on the Toolbar.\nModify the variables, mentioned earlier above.\nSave the app and test from within Script Editor.\nOnce done with testing, hit the Compile button on the Toolbar to reset the theAlreadySentList AppleScript property variable to an empty list, then save and close the 100 Messages to Send.app so as not to reset the theAlreadySentList AppleScript property variable once production mode begins.\nFirst example AppleScript code:\n--  ### Folder Path Variable\n\n--  # Set the location of the folder containing the 100 files.\n--  # NOTE: All 100 files must be in the same individual folder.\n\nset thisFolder to (path to documents folder as text) & \"100 Messages to Send\"\n\n--  ### Mail Variables\n\nset theRecipientName to \"John Doe\"\nset theRecipientAddress to \"johndoe@domain.com\"\nset theSubject to \"Hello World\"\n--  # Leave the following as 'missing value'.\nset theMessageContent to missing value\n\n\n--  ##### DO NOT modify below this line unless necessary. #####\n\n\n--  ### Some Other Variables\n\n--  # The property variable  'theAlreadySentList',  is a list of \n--  # filenames from which the messages have already been sent.\n--  # The value of this property is maintained so long as\n--  # this script is not save again or recompiled after it\n--  # has been originally saved for the first time.\n\nproperty theAlreadySentList : {}\nglobal thisFile\n\n--  ### Handler\n\non chooseRandomFileFrom(thisFolder)\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set thisFile to some file of container thisFolder\n    end tell\n    return thisFile\nend chooseRandomFileFrom\n\n--  # Get the count of entries in the 'theAlreadySentList' list.\n--  # This is used to display a message and break the 'repeat' loop\n--  # once all 100 messages have been sent.\n\nset theCount to (count of theAlreadySentList) as integer\n\n--  # Choose a file at random.\n\nset thisFileName to name of chooseRandomFileFrom(thisFolder)\n\n--  # Evaluate the sent status of 'thisFileName' and respond accordingly.\n\nrepeat -- 200 times -- # Uncomment if you want a failsafe out of the 'repeat' loop.\n    if theCount is equal to 100 then\n        display dialog \"All 100 messages have already been sent!\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n        exit repeat\n    else if thisFileName is in theAlreadySentList then\n        --  # Choose another file at random.\n        set thisFileName to name of chooseRandomFileFrom(thisFolder)\n    else\n        --  # This file has not been used yet, process accordingly.\n        set end of theAlreadySentList to thisFileName\n        tell application \"TextEdit\"\n            open thisFile\n            activate\n            delay 1 --# Adjust as necessary. Time must be given for the file to open before proceeding.\n            set theMessageContent to text of front document\n            close front document\n        end tell\n        tell application \"Mail\"\n            activate\n            set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, subject:theSubject, content:theMessageContent}\n            tell theMessage\n                make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {name:theRecipientName, address:theRecipientAddress}\n            end tell\n            -- delay 1 --# Adjust as necessary. Uncomment to use this command.\n            -- send theMessage --# Uncomment to use this command.\n        end tell\n        exit repeat\n    end if\nend repeat\n\n\nIn this second example AppleScript code, a disk file is used to store the list of filenames from which the content has already been sent as an email message.\nTo use this script, in Script Editor, create a new document and save it as an application in /Applications, naming it as, e.g. 100 Messages to Send.app. This is done so you can add a plain text file to the application bundle to use for the list of filenames already sent. (I prefer to keep related support files within the application bundle.)\nHaving saved the document as an application, now open the application bundle (in Finder, right-click Show Package Contents) to Contents/Resources/ and create the, e.g. Sent Messages Filename List.txt file as an empty file, and then close the application bundle.\nNext, copy and paste the example AppleScript code below into the e.g. 100 Messages to Send.app in Script Editor and hit the Compile button on the Toolbar.\nModify the variables, as mentioned earlier above.\nSave the app and test from within Script Editor.\nOnce done with testing, clear the entries from the Sent Messages Filename List.txt, so it's an empty file when running the app for the first time in production mode.\n\nSecond example AppleScript code:\n--  ### Folder Path Variable\n\n--  # Set the location of the folder containing the 100 files.\n--  # NOTE: All 100 files must be in the same individual folder.\n\nset thisFolder to (path to documents folder as text) & \"100 Messages to Send\"\n\n--  ### Mail Variables\n\nset theRecipientName to \"John Doe\"\nset theRecipientAddress to \"johndoe@domain.com\"\nset theSubject to \"Hello World\"\n--  # Leave the following as 'missing value'.\nset theMessageContent to missing value\n\n--  ### Sent Messages Filename List Location Variable\n\n--  # Set the location and name of the file containing the \n--  # filenames from which the content has already been sent.\n\nset myPath to POSIX path of (path to me as string)\nset theAlreadySentListFilename to myPath & \"Contents/Resources/Sent Messages Filename List.txt\"\n\n\n--  ##### DO NOT modify below this line unless necessary. #####\n\n\n--  ### Some Other Variables\n\nglobal thisFile\nglobal theAlreadySentList\nset theAlreadySentList to {}\n\n--  ### Handlers\n\non buildListFromDiskFile(thisDiskFile)\n    set thisContent to do shell script \"cat \" & quoted form of thisDiskFile\n    repeat with thisParagraph in paragraphs of text in thisContent\n        set end of theAlreadySentList to (thisParagraph as text)\n    end repeat\nend buildListFromDiskFile\n\non chooseRandomFileFrom(thisFolder)\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set thisFile to some file of container thisFolder\n    end tell\n    return thisFile\nend chooseRandomFileFrom\n\n--  # Load data from disk file for: 'theAlreadySentList'\n\nbuildListFromDiskFile(theAlreadySentListFilename)\n\n--  # Get the count of entries in the 'theAlreadySentList' list.\n--  # Used to display a message once all 100 messages have been sent.\n\nset theCount to (count of theAlreadySentList) as integer\n\n--  # Choose a file at random.\n\nset thisFileName to name of chooseRandomFileFrom(thisFolder)\n\n--  # Evaluate the sent status of 'thisFileName' and respond accordingly.\n\nrepeat -- 200 times -- # Uncomment if you want a failsafe out of the 'repeat' loop.\n    if theCount is equal to 100 then\n        display dialog \"All 100 messages have already been sent!\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n        exit repeat\n    else if thisFileName is in theAlreadySentList then\n        --  # Choose another file.\n        set thisFileName to name of chooseRandomFileFrom(thisFolder)\n    else\n        --  # This file has not been used yet, process accordingly.\n        --  #\n        --  # Add the filename to the list.\n        do shell script \"echo \" & thisFileName & \" >> \" & quoted form of theAlreadySentListFilename\n        --  # Get the content of the Rich Text file.\n        tell application \"TextEdit\"\n            open thisFile\n            activate\n            delay 1 --# Adjust as necessary.

I am on Sierra now and I started High Sierra setup from the AppStore. I already opened the installer and passed all the steps and get \"reboot to install\" message. \nThe issue is that I realized that I cannot update just now as some of the work-related enterprise applications does not support the new version. Is there a way how can I abort installation at this step? I feel like sitting on a time bomb - once I reboot I will have all kinds of trouble with enterprise stuff.\n\nA: You should be able to safely abort the install. Quit the installer without reboot. Then open Terminal.app and remove the installer folder (SIP has to be disabled to remove everything - most files and folders are deleted though, even when SIP is enabled!):\nsudo rm -Rf /macOS\\ Install\\ Data\n\nThen enter\nsudo systemsetup -setstartupdisk /System/Library/CoreServices\n\nA quick scan revealed that the only file/bundle installed/replaced (except some receipts) is /System/Library/CoreServices/MRT.app\nIts version number is 1.23. The original file's version in macOS Sierra is 1.22. MRT is (Apple's) Malware Removal Tool.\n\nIf SIP is enabled I recommend to execute the steps above. Then immediately boot to Recovery Mode and disable SIP. Then reboot opening the Start Up Prefs and choosing your main volume. Remove the remnants of the macOS Install Data folder (which should be possible now).\nReboot again to Recovery Mode and enable SIP again. Reboot to the main volume.\n\nApparently Sierra's MRT.app isn't available in any Sierra Combo updater. You would have to extract and re-install it using Pacifist and the latest macOS Sierra installer.\nHigh Sierra's MRT.app may also work in Sierra; so it's unclear whether installing the original version is really required.\n", "Q: iOS Siri: How to add multiple items to Reminders? Using Siri, adding items to a Reminders list can be done one-by-one by saying, \"Hey Siri, add apples to the shopping list\". Naively trying \"Add apples and oranges to the shopping list\" results in a single item, \"apples and oranges\", being added to the list.\nIs it possible to add multiple items with a single command?\n\nA: I found that if you want to dictate multiple items on the list you have to say “new line” after each item. For example:\n“add garlic (new line)\nTomatoes (new line)\nBasil (new line)\nTo Chris’s grocery list in AnyList”\n\nA: Siri can perform only one action at a time.\nSo to add five different items to a shopping list you need to activate Siri five times. The same is true for other actions like “wake me up at 6 and set a timer for five minutes”.\n\nA: I just tested on iOS 16.3, these works:\n\n*\n\n*Hey Siri, add to groceries list A and B and C.\n\n*Hey Siri, add A and B and C to groceries list.\n\n", "Q: gfortran compilation error (installing Quantum ESPRESSO) I'm trying to install Quantum ESPRESSO, but I keep getting an error when I'm configuring the make files (this installation procedure is addressed on page 8 of the manual).\nIn particular, I invoke sudo ./configure in my terminal, and I get the following error:\nchecking build system type... x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0\nchecking ARCH... mac686\nchecking setting AR... ... ar\nchecking setting ARFLAGS... ... ruv\nchecking for ifort... no\nchecking for gfortran... gfortran\nchecking for Fortran compiler default output file name... \nconfigure: error: in '/Users/malxmusician212/Downloads/qe-6.1':\nconfigure: error: Fortran compiler cannot create executables\nSee 'config.log' for more details.\n\nMy config.log is posted here.\n\nA: The problem is that you're giving arguments to the \"as\" (assembler) command, that it doesn't understand.\nThis is usually caused by you having installed more than one type of \"as\", and calling the wrong one.\nIn this case you're actually calling \"as\" in the /opt/local/ subtree, which is not the system default \"as\".\nTry removing /opt/local/bin/ from your path, and doing a reconfigure - or manually using configure arguments force the compilation to use a different \"as\" command.\n", "Q: Problems with time machine backup Why, when my hdd has only 160 gb of files  on it does my time machine say it is backing up over 250 gb?  \n\nA: Time Machine only makes an estimate of how much it thinks will backup.

On iOS 10 - I could regularly enter the health app to enter my weight each day. Each day the weight graph would come up when I opened the app and I could enter my data with a single tap. \nOn iOS 11 - the health app 'forgets' that I was last at the weight graph, and when you open it goes to the health app home screen. This means two more taps to get to the weight graph, which I didn't have to do on iOS10. \nIs there a way to fix this? It seems to be a feature regression. \nMy question is: Is it a bug that the Health App in the iOS11 upgrade 'forgets' your last place in the app?\n\nA: here (iOS 11.0.2), when I reopen Health it opens in the last used window.\n\nA: In summary, yes it is a bug (although some may split hairs and call it a poor implementation).\nIn detail:\nWhen you close any app it initially remains in a 'background' state. If you re-open it whilst it is still in the background state it will appear as if it had never been closed - with the same views open.\nHowever iOS cannot leave apps in this state forever as it will run out of memory. When memory gets low (because you open other apps for example) background apps get 'suspended'. If you re-open it whilst it is suspended it will restart from scratch and by default show its 'home' view. \nHowever there is a process called 'state restoration' that allows developers to bring a suspended app back to the same view as when it was last used (this typically takes a second or two, which is why apps sometimes seem to hesitate when you re-open them). This process has been broken in the update of the Health App which is why you are now seeing the default behaviour.\n", "Q: Transferring iPhone message history to new Mac? My filesystem was corrupted when updating to High Sierra so I wiped it and restored my files from a dropbox backup.

And now I have the same update pending in my App Store and of course I want to execute it.\nNow, I wouldn't want to fall back to the bad update situation so I was thinking maybe to download the update again. \nHow can I delete the files from the bad update?\nIs this strategy going to make any difference?\n(running on a MacBook Pro 15-inch 2016)\n\nA: Try downloading the update from Apple's website rather than through the App Store, and installing from that package.\n", "Q: Can I buy an Apple SIM card if I’m not a resident of the country where it's sold? Can Apple SIM cards be freely purchased, or are they tied to having an address in one of the thirteen countries where they are sold? I noticed an article on Mac Rumors that headlines “Truphone's Apple SIM Data Plans for iPad Will Be Available to Buy in Over 30 Countries Later This Year”. As I understand, data plans for an Apple SIM card can be purchased in other countries besides the 13 where Apple sells the cards. It sounds like it might be useful to have a card around, can I buy one when visiting one of the 13 countries? How much does Apple charge for the card?\nApple Support lists the countries where an Apple SIM card can be bought:\n\nIf your iPad didn't come with an Apple SIM card, you can buy an Apple SIM kit at an Apple Retail Store in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, or Turkey.\n\n\nA: Yes, you can1.\nI can confirm that you are able to get an Apple SIM, regardless of the status of residence in the country you are buying it in. Buying an Apple SIM does not require registration.\nIn Canada, it cost CA$5.00 for one.\n1Can’t find a source, but I tried it out.\n", "Q: Apple Watch Series 3 Workout not adding to my Exercise ring! Why not? I have one of those new fan dangled Apple Watches and sometimes my workouts don’t count towards my green exercise ring. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don’t! Why?\n-Extra info-\nBefore anyone questions this, I know this to be fact because I’ve tested it as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*I take a screenshot of my rings\n\n*I start an Outdoor Walk Workout\n\n*I walk for 20 minutes\n\n*I stop the Outdoor Walk Workout\n\n*I check my rings and the red Move ring has grown, but the green Exercise ring hasn’t changed\n\n\nI’ve done the above test many times this week. The only thing that changes is that sometimes the green Exercise ring grows, but usually it doesn’t.\nNot happy. :(\n\nA: Is your walk actually exercise?\nConsidering the intermittent nature of your issue, I’m wondering whether all your walks are actually exercise? \nAccording to the Health app on your iPhone:\n\nEvery full minute of movement equal to or exceeding the intensity of\n  a brisk walk counts towards your daily Exercise Minutes.\n\nNOTE: Emphasis mine\nSo, if you’re just going for a casual walk it’s not likely to count towards this ring. If your walk happens to be at a faster pace, it will. This would explain the intermittent nature of your experience with the Exercise ring, and also explains why the Move ring still works, because even a casual walk will burn calories.\n\nA: The bottom line is that it does not work properly.  It does count the movement that exceeds the heartbeat level of a brisk walk, however, it does not add the exercise if you start a workout. The problem here is that unless you maintain a high activity level all throughout your workout it only counts a partial exercise out of your full workout. Like I said, bottom line is that it does not work and it is annoying. The Polar M430 and the Fitbit surge works much better if all you are concern is your fitness tracking. \n\nA: People have been posting this question for over a year. Some work outs are reported reliably to the exercise ring, but others aren't.  In particular, the outdoor walk work outs are not reported, despite accurately reporting distance, route, time and heart rates under the Workouts tab of the Activities App.  The data just doesn't reliably flow into the exercise ring of the Activity App.  The only workout that will flow the time exercised into the exercise ring is the \"Other\" work out, which records only time and no other useful data.  \nPlease use the Apple Product Feedback website to complain about this bug.  If Apple hears enough complaints, they may eventually assign some engineers to fix this bug. Otherwise, the Apple Watch fails as a fitness tracker if you intend to use the work out apps to record outdoor walking and other workouts that don't reliably report data to the exercise ring.\n", "Q: VirtualBox 5.1.28 fails to install on MacOS 10.13 due to KEXT security I have tried to install VirtualBox 5.1.28 to macOS high sierra but it fails every time with the following screen:\n\nAfter some looking around I found this thread and I did indeed see that it was blocking VirtualBox from installing.\n\nAfter clicking allow and then trying to run the VirtualBox installer again it just fails again with the same generic error message and the same Security warning reappears in the \"Security and Privacy\" settings.\nI tried to also run the pkg install from the terminal to see if I could get more information about why its failing but it doesnt help.\n➜  Documents sudo installer -verbose -pkg VirtualBox.pkg -target /\ninstaller: Package name is Oracle VM VirtualBox\ninstaller: Installing at base path /\ninstaller: Preparing for installation….....\ninstaller: Preparing the disk….....\ninstaller: Preparing Oracle VM VirtualBox….....\ninstaller: Waiting for other installations to complete….....\ninstaller: Configuring the installation….....\ninstaller:\n#\ninstaller: Writing files….....\n#\ninstaller: Writing files….....\n#\ninstaller: Optimizing system for installed software….....\n#\ninstaller: Running package scripts….....\n#\ninstaller: Running package scripts….....\n#\ninstaller: Running package scripts….....\n#\ninstaller: Running package scripts….....\n#\ninstaller: Running package scripts….....\n#\ninstaller: Running package scripts….....\ninstaller: Validating packages….....\n#\ninstaller: The install failed (The Installer encountered an error that caused the installation to fail.

Is there a setting that will stop Safari from being able to use those buttons? \nI would prefer not having to install 3rd party software to do this. \nThis is still going on in macOS 10.14\n\nA: This was driving me crazy, so I wrote a little menu bar app to make the media keys only affect iTunes:\nhttp://stuntsoftware.com/reflex/\n", "Q: Can we download iTunes's 4K movies? I saw in the Hong Kong iTunes store showing \"Featured 4K HDR Movies\":\n\nbut it doesn't show a 4K logo or a 4K download size:\n\n\nIs it downloadable? Can it be viewed on the Mac in 4K (such as on the iMac with 5k display) or does it need to be Apple TV 4K in order to watch it in 4K?\n\nA: Source:\n4K content can only be streamed and not downloaded.\nPer Apple:\n\nWhen you buy or rent a movie from the iTunes Store, it automatically plays in the highest-quality format available for the device on which you're watching it.  You can download a local copy of an HD movie to your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, or PC, and you might be able to download HDR and Dolby Vision versions to your iOS devices, but you can't download a 4K version.\nTo see if a movie can play in 4K on a compatible device, look for 4K icon on the product page. By default, all videos that you can buy or rent in the iTunes Store are available to play back in HD3.\nMovies in the iTunes Store might also be available in HDR10 HDR icon or Dolby Vision Dolby Vision icon. Content automatically plays in the HDR format that is compatible with your device.\n\nCould it be possible that the movie is available in 4K but the device you were using to browse iTunes wasn't able to display 4K?

This is all well and good, but very different to the way things used to work.\nBy purchasing the server app on the app store, do I get all of the features of the old server OS, for example Mac OS X Server 10.5, or does it only add a few features?\nIs this a set of server management tools, or does it convert my client OS into a full server OS?\nCan I use it on multiple machines simultaneously. If not, can I install it more than once (if I do not use it on multiple installations simultaneously)?\nIs it a one-time-payment for all updates to the server OS?\nis it limited to a certain amount of installs before I have to purchase it again?\n\nA: It’s a one-time payment, and it’s standard App Store licensing — you can use it on all Macs you own for personal use which also means if you use the same AppleID to download to 15 to 30 Macs, you might get an email from Apple or just be in violation of the Mac App Store terms. \nOverall, the server app enables command line and guidance management of many server features already present in MacOS, since it’s Unix, and adds a bunch more custom code and server functionality from the app that packages scripts and binary tools as opposed to a new replacement OS. \n", "Q: Record video in 16:9 aspect ratio on the iPad running iOS 11 How can I record a video on iOS with an aspect radio of 16:9? I am using the iPad 9.7\" 2017 model. I am running iOS 11.\n\nA: Double tap on the screen while the camera is in video mode. That will switch the aspect ratio between 4:3 and 16:9.\n\nI was fooling around with my iPad 2 and I found that you can change the aspect ratio when taking video! (not sure if this works on other iOS devices running iOS 4.3) But all you have to do is go to your iPad 2’s camera app, and double tap on the view finder. (I double tapped on the right side of the screen).\nThat’s it! Now you can record widescreen (16:9 ratio) 720p video instead of the regular “legacy” full screen (4:3 ratio) 720p video!\n\nSource\n\nA: You cant. You need an external editor to convert it to 16:9.  I think it is very short sighted of Apple by not having this ability in iOS.\n", "Q: How to temporarily suspend iTunes Connect payments for app earnings? I should temporarily suspend Apple's payments for sales of my apps on AppStore.\nOther markets allow you to change the minimum amount to receive your payments, or suspend payments for a few months.

The Advanced section of the Wifi - Network Preferences allows for dragging and dropping of known wifi networks in order to set a priority order for joining networks. (Networks higher in the list will be joined first, when multiple are available.)\n\nBy default, newly joined networks are added to the end of the list. My problem is that I have hundreds of known networks and the list cannot be searched, nor can the window be made larger to allow for more effective scrolling. \nI was wondering if there exists a better method, or perhaps a third-party app, that would give a better UI to search and re-sort known wifi networks.

I have an iPhone 5c that is not eligible for iOS 11. I don't want to have to buy a new phone if this one will still work, so is there a way to jailbreak the phone and install iOS 11? Or does it not work like that? Thanks for any help, I'd like to understand how this works. \n\nA: It’s not possible. The iPhone 5c has a 32-bit CPU, and iOS 11 has dropped 32-bit support and will only run on 64-bit CPUs. Apple will let you install it on any phone that can run it at all, which is the iPhone 5s or newer. \n\nA: No, this is not possible.\n\nI don't want to have to buy a new phone if this one will still work...\n\nYour iPhone will still work with its current operating system, though. Don't feel you need to upgrade, only get a new phone if you really want to.\nAs to \"why\", there are many reasons. For one, as Mike Scott mentioned, the iPhone 5c has a 32-bit processor, and iOS 11 requires a 64-bit processor to run. Secondly, the operating system has various aspects which rely on the exact device you own. Depending on whether you have an iPhone or iPad, a GSM or CDMA phone, and so on, you need to have a slightly different version of the operating system. In order to run on a certain device, Apple needs to develop a version of it specifically for that device.\n", "Q: Seeking a USB Flash Drive (nearly) flush with MacBook I am seeking a low-profile USB flash drive (in either 2.0 or 3.0) that would sit nearly flush with the side of the MacBook.\nThis way I can leave it in through reboot cycles, and hopefully find that macOS will mount it without needing to insert anew after every reboot.\nThe SanDisk \"Ultra Fit\" looked promising in Amazon's pictures, until I found that it protrudes quite a bit. It means that if I pull the MacBook from its bag and inadvertendly knock the flash drive, I will risk  also knocking the logic board—possibly a very nasty event.\n\nDoes there exist a solution that sits nearly flush with the side of a MacBook? Ideally it would protrude just enough so I can grab it when necessary, but even if I need a special tool (such as two tiny screwdrivers) to pull it out, that is also good.\nAnother option is from Elago\n\nDo you have any experience with this product? Does it nearly vanish inside a MacBook?\n\nA: I'm not aware of any such products with a USB connection, but there are several options for using an SD card slot in this way, if your model of MacBook has such a slot. Some of these are storage devices, while others are microSD card readers, but both types have the same functionality. Note that different models of MacBook have different depths of SD card slot, so make sure you get a product designed to work with your computer.\nHere are a few examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transcend JetDrive Lite (64-256 GB)\n\n*PNY StorEdge (128-256 GB)\n\n*BaseQi microSD adapter\n\n*MiniDrive Nifty microSD adapter\n\nA: Try the SANDISK ULTRA FIT USB 3.0 FLASH DRIVE\nIt only goes up to 128GB though ($37.99)\nhttps://www.sandisk.com/home/usb-flash/ultra-fit-usb\n", "Q: Copy Books from Mac to iBooks for iPhone without using iCloud or iCloud Drive I would like to read all of my books on my iPhone in iBooks, but there seems to be no way to copy the books into iBooks. I can't use iCloud/iCloud Drive because there is not enough space available in iCloud to store all of my books.\nIt seems that iTunes is only able to sync audio books to my iPhone and not (ePub) books (like it used to).\n\nThe new iBooks for Mac can display my collection quite nicely but only allows me to sync via iCloud.\n\nHow can I copy Books from my Mac to iBooks for iPhone without using iCloud or iCloud Drive?\n\nA: Any file transfer option that simply copies the file directly will suffice, or you can use a third-party ebook manager such as Calibre.\nTo transfer the files directly, you can use AirDrop or file syncing options such as Dropbox and Google Drive. Of these, I would personally recommend using AirDrop, as since it is transferred with a local ad-hoc Wi-Fi connection, it never needs to leave your local network and allows for fast transfer speeds of even very large files. Note that this will only work if your iOS and Mac devices meet these requirements.\nThe Apple support website offers these instructions for using AirDrop to send files to an iOS device:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Choose Go > AirDrop from the menu bar in the Finder. Or select\n  AirDrop in the sidebar of a Finder window.\n  \n*The AirDrop window shows\n  nearby AirDrop users. Drag one or more items to the recipient's\n  image in the window, then click Send.\n  \n  \n  Or use the Share feature:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Click the Share button, if available in your app. Or Control-click an item in the Finder, then choose Share from the shortcut menu.\n  \n*The Share menu lists several sharing options. Choose AirDrop.\n  \n*Select a recipient from the AirDrop sheet, then click Done.\n  \n\nIf you'd rather have a library of all your books on your computer, and then sync them semi-automatically, this answer gives some information as to how to use Calibre with an iOS device.\n", "Q: MBP Battery Consumption and Charging Speed app? I'd like to know if there is an app that shows you how fast (how many Watts) the MBP is consuming and how fast it is charging (Watts and Voltage).\nI know that there is the Activity Monitor but it only shows an Energy Impact that doesn't translate to Watts.\nThe 15\" model has a 76Wh battery, and the charger is 87W. Is it correct to say that if I charge a 0% battery MBP while it is turned off it should take a little bit less than 1 hour? Also if I charge that with my smartphone chargers that output 18W at max (QC2 and QC3) is there a way to know if it is charging using the full power (and the voltage/amperage)?\n\nA: Your best bet would be to try coconutBattery. It provides a whole heap of information that you'll find useful, and from memory includes both Discharging with and Charging with measurements in watts!\nAs for your other questions, it's really best to just ask one question per question, even though they may be related. However, in a nutshell:\n\n\n*\n\n*No, you cannot assume the 87W USB-C Power Adapter will charge a 76 watt hour battery in less than an hour. There are a lot of factors that can affect charging times, and typically this means you'd be waiting longer than an hour. However, in theory and under the best case scenario (e.g. your MBP is powered off and the charger is working at the optimal 20.2V and 4.3A and has absolutely no efficiency loss) it could in theory be fully charged in about 52 minutes. If we assume the same scenario but with a typical efficiency loss of 20%, it will take a little longer than an hour (63 mins to be exact) to charge your battery. Of course, in real life many factors can affect this.\n\n*I would not recommend using a smartphone charger to charge your MBP. Yes, in some cases this will work, in many it won't. However, while it may be okay to do this on a one-off basis because you've forgotten your MBP charger, it is not something I would recommend doing on any sort of ongoing basis. Eventually it will most likely damage your smartphone charger, although this will depend on its quality and design.\n\n\nNOTE: Calculations used in my answer assume a 2016 or 2017 15\" MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: Restore not working I've put my iPad into recovery mode, but it's not restoring. I click the restore button on my Mac, agree, etc, and then just get this\n\nI'm using the new cheap iPad (10.5 or something) and it's running iOS 11.0.1, iTunes on my computer is the newest available. Why isn't it working???\n\nA: Put your iPad back into recovery mode.\nTry to restore again and accept the T&C for iOS 11, then this time when you get those greyed out buttons, look above in iTunes on the upper right hand side and look for a box with a download arrow with a moving circle around it.\nClick on that box and it will tell you how long the update will take to download.\nThe recovery screen is meant to timeout every 15 mins due to it not being directly accessible by the general public. Also if someone accidentally resets their iPad and the recovery screen pops up, that time will get the tablet back on the lockscreen for the average user since they need to be on that side of the software.\n", "Q: Locate tool won’t work, how do I fix I was trying to update the locate database, but when input sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb, I got a bunch of errors.

I got locate to work again by using Time Machine to recover the locate.database file. But I want to be able to update locate without corrupting the file. How do I fix this?\n\nA: Open Terminal.app and run the following two commands:\ncd /\nsudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb\n\nThe \"cd /\" part is important as you need to be in a path where the user \"nobody\" has permissions.\n\nA: The command to update the database is\nsudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb\n\nIt should get run automatically every week from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist but you can run it manually if required.\n", "Q: How can I access the same account (and files) from either of two Macs? I have two Macs in two rooms. Both have just macOS (High Sierra).\nI would like to log into either one from my user account, and find my files the way I last edited them on either Mac.\nAccessing one's account from any one of multiple linux machines is a common arrangement on that OS. All CS departments do this with hundreds of linux PCs.\nIs the same possible with Macs, perhaps through a RAID attached to a dedicated Airport Extreme?\nThe term \"Server\" in macOS Server seems to point to the ability to host a web server. I don't understand why that is an additional feature when one can run a server on vanilla macOS just fine. Does the term \"server\" here refer to the ability to access one (or multiple) account(s) from any one of multiple Macs in the same LAN?\nContext + comparison with Linux/Windows solutions\nOn Linux machines (in CS labs) the speed to access one's files is formidable. It's all but impossible to tell that the files are not local but on an NFS. MS Windows has something similar, but the speed is pathetic. So much so that all users always end up storing a lot of files on their local machines (even in 2017) just for the file read/write operations to be good; it's extremely slow to access files on Windows servers.\nIronically, a Samba server running on Linux and serving Windows machines is a far superior solution. Have you tried a Mac-only solution (with either of the two scenarios you suggest: dedicated NFS or one Mac dedicated to be a server)? Is the file read/write speed in roughly the same league as files local to a Mac?\nUpdate\nThe question is becoming too broad. I'm forking the two sequel questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Direct Attached Storage\n\n*Network Attached Storage\n\nA: Yes, the same is possible with Macs.\nUsually you would create such a setup using macOS Server, which includes these features. macOS Server costs $19.99 on the App Store.\nThis will require you to have either a seperate dedicated server, or assign one of your existing computers to also be a server. The server must be running in order for you to be able to login with such a \"shared\" account on other computers.\nYou can also setup this manually, similar to a Linux setup:\nThis would require you to have some sort of directory setup in order to share the account itself across computers (i.e. typically OpenDirectory or Active Directory - that is variations of LDAP). In your very limited setup you could also manually setup your account on each Mac.\nIn addition to this you would need a NFS file server to store the actual contents of your home directory (i.e. all your files) on.\nThe performance of either solution in terms of read/write speed is comparable to the Linux solution, as it is really the exact same type of setup.\n\nA: Is this possible?\nMost definitely.  It all depends on how you want to architecture this.\n\n*\n\n*Direct Attached Storage\n\n*Network Attached Storage (NAS/SAN)\n\n*Cloud Storage\n\n\nDirect Attached Storage\nDirect attached is quite easy - you simply hook up both machines to a storage array (Fibre Channel) is quite common but copper is now becoming very accessible.  This will have the highest performance and is what is used in labs and large scale deployments.  While fast, it's also expensive.\nNetwork Attached Storage\nNetwork Attached Storage (NAS) is quite  easy to implement.  I personally use Synology NAS to create my own hybrid cloud (personal local cloud that syncs with OneDrive and Dropbox).  With a little configuration I have the same shares mapped to my iMac, MacBook Pro and old (white) Macbook.  This is effectively what you are asking for and this is probably the most cost effective solution.\nOne \"tweak\" which will certainly speed up your file access times is to add a second network adapter to your Macs which only connect to the NAS.  Many NAS devices have dual gigabit connectors that support bonding (both acting as one single interface).  By moving your network traffic onto its own interface, you greatly reduce latency and improve performance for next to nothing in cost.\nCloud Storage\nCloud is the easiest solution.  By having your files automatically sync with a cloud service like iCloud, OneDrive or Dropbox, you effective get exactly what you are looking for.  While convenient, it's slow and depending on how much storage you require, there's a cost involved.\n", "Q: How to adjust volume during movie playback on iOS 11? A recent update to iOS 11 eliminated the volume control, which used to be in the corner of the screen when you tapped a movie as it was playing.   My iPad is on a stand and the physical volume controls are not as easily accessed.  I found that I can do a cumbersome double-swipe up from the bottom of the screen, and sometimes get to the control center.  Sometimes I just get the home bar and have to try a third or fourth swipe.  Once I get the control center, the movie shrinks (while still playing) into a tiny window near other apps that are running.  Then, I can tap on the volume control, which looks a bit like a white and black thermometer now, and hold my finger for a while.  It will enlarge and the everything including the movie will blur.  Once it is enlarged, IF I keep my finger on it, I can slide the volume up and down, but if I accidentally remove my finger the control is unresponsive, and I need to collapse it again and press and hold a while more to start over.  Finally, I get to adjust the volume.   Once set, I can tap anywhere in the blurred screen to return to the tiny windows and then select the one containing my movie which has been playing.  It will enlarge again and I will then slide the movie playback controls to find where I was in the movie before I started this complex adventure in volume control.\nIf you're like me, you may find yourself wanting to quickly adjust the volume up and down during a movie.  If your device is on a stand, how do you do it?  Is there another volume control or way to open an easier to use interface for quickly adjusting volume as you watch a movie?\n\nA: I allowed an update to iOS again last night to v11.0.2 and Apple has fixed the problem.   They added the volume control back, and it is in the bottom left corner.  To access it, simply tap anywhere while a movie is playing.\n", "Q: Not able to Reinstall MacOS in Internet Recovery Mode I have a mid 2013 Macbook Air. \nWithout realizing the effect of my actions, I accidentally typed into my terminal a sudo -rm -rf \"Xcode\" command, where I intended to delete Xcode but in actuality deleted all files that contained anything to do with Xcode. As a result, my Mac software was corrupted, and I am unable to login to my computer (it goes to login screen, after entering credentials it crashes).\nAfter countless hours with Apple Support, I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried reinstalling Mac OS in normal recovery mode (Command + R) but it doesn't let me because it keeps asking me to enter login info for App Store purchases and never closes that screen.\n\n*Then I tried Internet Recovery Mode, which for some reason isn't able to reinstall MacOS because of an Internet issue (although it works in normal recovery mode) and gives the error \"Could not connect to Recovery Mode server.\" I read up on this on Stack Overflow, and it was advised to use an Ethernet cable connection, which I have tried, but it still doesn't work. In the Safari in the Internet Recover Mode, it gives me the error \"Localized String not Found\".\n\n\nA: Do you have access to another Mac? If so, I'd download the OS installer to that machine, and use it to make a bootable USB stick via the createinstallmedia tool which is inside Contents/Resources in the installer's app bundle. Then, boot your Mac from that USB stick and all should be well.\nAlternately, connect your Mac to another Mac via target disk mode and install it from a fully-booted macOS installation that way.\n", "Q: MacOS High Sierra: An error occurred while verifying firmware I have a Mid 2011 iMac currently running MacOS 10.12 Sierra. It’s not my main machine, but I would like to install 10.13 on it.\nUpdating starts smoothly enough, but when it comes to restarting, I get the following message:\n\nmacOS could not be installed on your computer\n  An error occurred while verifying firmware.\n\nI understand that my Mac is on the edge, but I read that any machine which supports 10.12 will also support 10.13\nThe iMac is running from an external SSD, due to a problem with the logic board, so I know that I have some problems. The iMac no longer boots from the internal drive (or recognises the DVD), but still works otherwise.\nHowever, the problems don’t seem to be invove the actual firmware, and the iMac is happily running 10.12.\nWhat does this message mean, and can it be resolved?\n\nA: Apple has introduced a new file system APFS in High Sierra. The easy fix is to verify your backup and then erase the volume and run the installer against a blank / erased main storage drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\nBecause the APFS requires support from a new version firmware, your mac's firmware will have to be updated to the latest version during the installation of High Sierra.\nAfter the first restart, the installer prepares the latest version firmware which suitable for your mac model onto EFI system partition of your main disk with bless command. Then restart automatically and trigger the firmware upgrade process. (marked as point A)\nAfter the upgrade process (regardless success or fail), the installer continues. It double checks the version of firmware to make sure it was updated successfully in previous process (namely point A). As a result, the installer find out that your firmware is NOT a latest version still. Hence, it reports \"An error occurred while verifying firmware\". Yes, it is what you saw on the screen.\nThe root cause of the failure at point A, in your case, is no internal drive in main bay. The firmware upgrade process only recognize the ESP (EFI System Partition) of primary internal drive. That means the upgrade process was interrupted.\nSo, you might have to get the primary SATA port work and connect your disk to it. It's said that, most of time, it is the hard drive cable which is out of order, instead of the chipset. If that is the case, it probably  can be fixed within $20 to get a replacement. And that was my case. :)\n\nA: I had the same issue trying to install High Sierra on my late 2011 MacBook Pro, in which I'd replaced its mechanical HDD with an SSD. The fix was to download the latest version of the High Sierra installer from the App Store and run that - it is version 13.1.05 at the time of writing. Make sure you delete any existing installer you might have first.\nThis version ran without issue first time, updating the computer's firmware and installing High Sierra.\nAccording to anecdotal comments online, it seems that Apple is installing a firmware upgrade and older versions of the High Sierra installer only worked with specific drive configurations.  In my case, I expect the firmware checker was expecting a HDD in this machine when it's now an SSD.\n\nA: Had the same problem on a MacBook Pro 17” (Mid-2010). Turns out it was the aftermarket SSD I had installed pretty much as soon as I bought it. Luckily I kept the original hard drive around, and after trying the newest installer and rebooting into safe mode several times without any joy, I just took a screwdriver and put the old HDD back in temporarily (there are good guides on ifixit.com). The installation with the original HDD completed without any problems, including the firmware update. Afterward, I put the SSD back in and installed Hugh Sierra without any problems - as the firmware update had already been completed, there  no longer seemed to be the system check that had tripped me up previously. \nMany thanks for your helpful answers. Incidentally, I also have a late 2009 iMac where the original hard drive has been swapped out (drive failure - not even the same manufacturer) and an SSD occupies the optical drive bay. In contrast to my MacBook Pro, the update finished without problems on the iMac. That fits with the issue being related to the primary SATA port. \n\nA: I am getting the impressions that the problem with the logic board is causing this error.\nI finally decided to take advantage of the fact the the main drive is external and to plug it into my newer iMac. From there, I could boot from the external drive and install High Sierra successfully.\nIt didn’t go perfectly smoothly. When the Mac wants to restart as part of the installation, I had to convince to boot again from the external drive, which wasn’t as reliable as I had hoped. I also have an additional partition as a backup, which complicated things. I then had to convince the new Mac to boot from the correct internal partition when I finished.\nNevertheless, I could then plug my external drive back into the old Mac, and it’s been working fine since then. I have even successfully installed minor updates since then.\n\nA: In my case, I mounted the EFI partition only to find that it's full and no extra space is left. No wonder the App Store repeatedly reminded me to update the firmware after I clicked update again and again (the update must failed, and App Store didn't inform me of that). I cleared the useless contents in EFI partition and then everything is fine. The error is gone and I successfully updated to Mojave.\n\nA: When installing high sierra I had an error saying that the firmware couldn't get verified.\nDone this:\ndiskutil verify disk0\ndiskutil repair disk0\n\nWhen asked to remove, say yes.\nThen start your High Sierra installer again.\nThis worked for me as i couldnt manually update the firmware on my MacBook (Mid 2010).\n", "Q: How do I fix the iOS 11 update not appearing on an iPad Air 2? How do I fix the iOS 11 update not appearing on an iPad? Oddly, the Software Update menu item in the Settings app is showing a red “1” badge, indicating that an update is available. But when opening the item, there’s only a message that the iPad is running iOS 10.3.3 and is up to date. This seems like a bug? I already tried restarting the iPad, but this hasn’t resolved the problem. The iPad is a family member’s iPad Air 2, and there’s more than enough free space to download the update (> 30gb). Is there anything else I can try or is my only recourse to bring a laptop and use iTunes?\n\nA: Try restarting it one more time using a force restart. After that it should appear in Settings.\n\nA: I don’t know what causes this issue. Based on my own experience, all I can suggest others try is to restart the device more than once. In my case, the update didn’t show up until after restarting the iPad twice.\n", "Q: Upgrade to High Sierra stalls/fails at “Calculating installation time“ I am trying to upgrade my 2015 MacBook Pro from Sierra to High Sierra.\nI downloaded the installer from the Mac app store and started it. The first slightly alarming sign was during a reboot about a minute or two in the process when the screen went black and then displayed white horizontal bars in places on the screen (like a display glitch) for a few seconds before then rebooting and continuing.\nIt then displayed the Apple logo with a progress bar which then displayed “Calculating installation time”. This remained on the screen and nothing else seemed to progress any further. I left the installer to continue running overnight, but when I woke up this morning it was still stuck in the same place, and the progress bar had not moved.\nRealising that the installation had probably failed, I rebooted to try again. Now I cannot get beyond entering my password to unlock the storage drive (SSD), some console errors appear briefly on the screen, and then I get a multilingual message on a black screen to wait or press a key to reboot. \nWhat should I do now?\nIs it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to launch the recovery system (if this has not already been wiped),\n\n*Reinstall the existing OS from there (or from USB stick, failing that),\n\n*Restore my files from Time Machine,\n\n*Try again?\n\n\nI saw in another post that someone else had problems upgrading, apparently due to having an NTFS driver installed. I have the Paragon NTFS driver installed to allow me to use NTFS external drives. Given that High Sierra has new rules about kernel extensions, which I imagine a file system driver must use, it sounds as though I should perhaps uninstall this before trying to upgrade again?\n\nA: I finally managed to resolve this problem by attempting to see if I could use MacOS Recovery to reinstall the existing OS, if this was still possible.\nRecovering the existing OS seemed not to be possible, but I was able to unlock and mount the laptop's drive (which seemed to be the point where the previous OS upgrade attempt had failed) using the recovery system's Disk Utility, and then use the internet recovery option to install MacOS High Sierra via the internet. \nThe installation was successful this time, the drive was converted from HFS Plus to APFS successfully, and my data was preserved.\n", "Q: Reinstalling macOS but not option of \"Restoring from Time Machine backup\" shown I am struggling to restore my system from a MacBook Pro of one generation to a more new one.\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I restart the system in recover mode: \"cmd + r\"\n\n*I choose the proper backup version from my Time Machine hard drive\n\n*I \"Accept\" but id doesn't allow me because is a different model and it recommends to me to choose \"Reinstall macOS\" and wait for the option of restore from Time Machine during the reinstallation process (\"You can't restore this backup because it was created by a different model of Mac\")\n\n*I choose \"Reinstall macOS\" but after 30 minutes of install process not option about using an existing Time Machine backup asked\n\n*I am expecting to see the \"Setup assistant\" but at the end of reinstall process my system restarts with the old installation (with the old Users and everything)\n\n\nI have tried this process several times, always with the external disk with the Time Machine version connected, but always the above same result.\nWhat can I do to make my Time Machine backup appear when installing macOS?\n\nA: I’ve always had luck just installing the os version I want.

I'm using Mac OS Sierra on an 11 inch Macbook Air, using an external Acer 24 inch monitor. I would like Night Shift to be always on.\nIn system preferences -> displays -> Acer G236HL -> the Night Shift tab, here's a picture of the settings:\n\nThe closest way to getting what I want is to check \"Turn on until tomorrow\", which works as expected. However, I have to do this every morning.\nI thought I could get an essentially permanent Night shift by using the \"schedule\" option (with Manual checked off, which I'm reasonably assuming) to set a range beginning 5 min from now, ending 4 min from now, and then waiting 5 minutes. For example, if the time is currently 12:15 PM, I would set the scheduled Night shift to begin at 12:20 PM and end at 12:19 PM, e.g. running for 23 hours and 59 minutes. However, this doesn't seem to work; Night shift simply remains off, and the scheduling option seems to do nothing.\nHow can I permanently enable Night shift without having to recheck the \"Turn on until Tomorrow\" box every single morning?\n\nA: I just use the schedule with the following custom schedule:\nFrom: 04 AM\nTo: 03:59 AM\nThis way it's always on (apart from that minute between).\nNote: I don't know if this will work with all external monitors; in which case as suggested you will have to adjust colour profile.\n", "Q: Custom shortcut for switching input sources in macOS High Sierra I need to remap \"Select the previous input source\" shortcut in macOS High Sierra 10.13.\nI recently installed fresh macOS High Sierra removing my previous OS and I found that there is no option to change default shortcut from Ctrl+Space to something else. \nI used to use macOS Sierra and I managed to set this shortcut to Cmd ⌘+Space.

This is a sequel question to a previous one.\nI would like to set up a home networking solution with Direct Attached Storage.\n\"Direct Attached Storage\" seems to suggest that I would run cables (Ethernet, presumably) from two Macs to some kind of medium.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is that medium? In particular, are we talking here specifically about SATA RAID rather than RAID? IIUC the former requires running not Ethernet cables but SATA cables (can these be 30-40 ft long?), where the latter requires attaching via USB to an Airport Extreme or similar.\n\n*Is a third Mac needed to act as a server?\n\n*Is macOS server needed?\n\n*What is the name of the software that you would run to actually \"serve\"?\n\n\nA: DAS means you connect one or multiple external hard discs locally (e.g. by USB or SATA)\n1) Then, you share them from this computer. What you need are standard external USB drives and a working home network. \n2) You can share them using any Mac that is \"always on\" when the others are on\n3) no, standard Mac OS will do\n4) OSX. System preferences->Share->File Sharing\nTo connect, in the Finder select \"Connect to Server...\" under the Go menu.\n\nA: \nI would like to set up a home networking solution with Direct Attached\n  Storage.\n\nGoing on the premise of your linked (previous) question, which is to log into either one of your Macs and have access to your files in their current state, you need a shared storage solution.\n\nYour network and the storage connections would be entirely separate entities.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Your medium could be SATA, SAS, SCSi, Fibre Channel, or 10GB copper.  \na.  RAID is just Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks and how you configure it is entirely up to you.  The end result it you will have multiple (physical) disks that comprise and show as a single logical volume.\nb. SATA cables are limited to 1M.  Ethernet is limited to 100M, Fibre Channel can go from 2M to 1.4KM depending on the speed and the fibre type.\nc. Anything over Ethernet is technically networking even if point-to-point (iSCSI is the most common, but not natively supported in macOS)\n\n*No.  In this configuration, a third Mac is not needed.\n\n*MacOS Server is not needed as a third Mac (or any computer for that matter) is not needed.  Adding a third Mac (presumably to attach to the storage device itself) turns this into a NAS configuration.\n\n*On a DAS setup, there's no need for software as the operating system will mount the shared volume in basically the same manner as you would a USB flash drive.  \nBottom Line\nWhile DAS will be super fast and convenient, it's really only good for servers and in some cases video editing where the user needs copious amounts of high performance, low latency storage.\nIf this is just for accessing a common set of files, there are much more efficient and cost effective solutions like a NAS or the cloud. \n", "Q: How would I architecture Network Attached Storage? This is a sequel (1, 2) question.\nI'm interested in setting up a home networking solution. One or more individuals would be able to access their accounts from any one of multiple Macs around the house.\nDirect Attached Storage is one solution.\nHere I'm pursuing the alternative, Network Attached Storage.\n\n\n*\n\n*What hardware do I need for a minimal installation. Say two Macs are the \"terminals\". Is a third Mac needed as a server?\n\n*Presumably I need some kind of RAID disk. Can you confirm?\n\n*is macOS server needed?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*You need a NAS server, not a third Mac\n\n*You need some standard SATA drives to mount into the NAS or buy one that ships with disks included\n\n*No\n\nA: A NAS or Network Attached storage is the most cost effective and simple way to set up your file sharing based on your linked previous question(s).\n\nNetwork-attached storage (NAS) is a file-level computer data storage\n  server connected to a computer network providing data access to a\n  heterogeneous group of clients. NAS is specialized for serving files\n  either by its hardware, software, or configuration. It is often\n  manufactured as a computer appliance – a purpose-built specialized\n  computer\n\nIn basic terms, it's a computer with storage attached that's shared over the network.\nTo get a NAS setup, you need a network attached computer that you share storage with.  It can be as complex as having a third computer (Mac Pro, Mac mini, or a PC with Windows, FreeBSD, Linux, etc).  No special software is needed as all modern OSes support sharing of folders/Volumes over the network.\n\nIdeally, you want something simple and cost effective; this is where a dedicated, purpose built appliance comes into play.\n\nBoth setups accomplish the exact same thing, except the second scenario with a purpose built NAS does it easier and more cost effectively.\nSo, as to your questions...\n\n\n*\n\n*A minimal installation is the second scenario as described.  I prefer Synology because their products have not only proven reliable but out-of-the-box compatible in heterogenous environments (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.)\n\n*You don't need RAID, but it's reccomended.  RAID gives you redundancy whereas a single disk doesn't.  In my setup, I have two disks mirrored and then backed up to an external USB drive.  If one drive fails, I can continue to function.  If both, or the device fails, I still have a backup.  Basically, I back up my backup.\n\n*macOS Server is not needed and is basically overkill.  In fact, it's more like hunting a mouse with an elephant gun. Everything you need is already built into your Macs and setting up the network share is just a matter of configuring it on the NAS. \nSetting up Network based Logins (aka Directory Server via LDAP)\nWith both scenarios, you have the ability to allow for network based logins/home directories so that you can log into any client (Mac machine) and gain access to all of your preferences and files beyond that of just simple folder mapping/file sharing.\nmacOS supports this out of the box and most NAS manufacturers make this feature freely available (you just need to enable it).  Synology has excellent documentation on how to setup both the NAS and the macOS client in their Directory Server Users Guide\nCan you do it with a \"third Mac\"?  Yes, but you will need to get macOS Server (for the Directory Services) and you would still need to get the storage (and the Mac if you don't already have one).  (IMO) it's much easier and more cost effective to get a dedicated NAS device.  \n\nA: Type of hardware is depend of \"kind of solution\", i.e.\n- in case of DAS solution, they need 1 MacServer (on which is be placed shared-RAID, and 1 or more \"Mac-workstations' **\n- if NAS (network-attached) solution is selected, then no need \"dedicated server\" and 2 of Mac-workstations is enough. And - external RAID with support of NFS file system. \n** there is lot of available software-solutions, which is realized useful functions for \"sharing RA1D\", but not required Mac Server OS\n\nA: To answer your question keeping in mind that you specifically want to be able to login to your account on another Mac (i.e. sharing your home directory as well as account, including preferences, etc.):\n1) You do not need a third Mac, one of the two Macs can pose as the server. However it needs to be turned on while the other Mac is using the file storage.\n2) RAID disk is not needed as such. You can use multiple ordinary hard drives or SSDs and form a RAID volume using macOS software in order to gain reliability and/or speed. It is not a requirement though.\n3) Yes, macOS Server is needed if you want to easily setup sharing of the home directory over NFS as well as the account using OpenDirectory. You can do without macOS Server and set it all up manually, however it is usually not worth it compared to the low cost of macOS Server (19.99$).\n", "Q: MacBook locked or with virus?

Usually, you will receive an email if an unknown device logs into your iCloud account, so I would check there to see if any suspicious login attempts were made. \nUnfortunately, the only way to unlock your Mac is to know the password that was used to lock it on Find My iPhone. For now, I suggest that you change your iCloud password. You can take your Mac to a local Apple store or Apple Authorized Service Provider, who may be able to unlock your Mac.\nMy guess is that Apple.pass@post.com is run by some sort of scam service.

Is there a way to trick iTunes into trying again properly?\nI have iTunes 12.7.0.166 on macOS Sierra 10.12.6\n\nA: For me the same track results in pure silence.\nPlease contact Apple's iTunes team regarding this issue (iTunes > Store > View my Account > purchases > 'Report a problem'). This is nothing you can solve on your own. Apple has to fix the issue with the track in order for you to download the correct song.\n\nA: What worked for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*right-click on the track, \"Remove Download\"\n\n*play the track anyway, i.e. so it plays 'from the cloud'... it played all the way through without a glitch\n\n*now download the track again\n\n\nVoilà, it's fixed.\nRe @atlex2's comment below. I checked the following:\nI'm on macOS and iTunes 12.9.5.5 ... for an album downloaded from iTunes store (not Apple Music) I can right-click on a single track and select \"Remove Download\" (Note: not \"Delete from Library\" and not the whole album). At this point the track shows this icon:\n\nClicking the cloud with arrow icon will download the track again from iTunes.\nBut see full method above for solving issue with glitchy track.\n", "Q: List of Metadata Attribute Aliases That I can Search for in Spotlight If I open up Spotlight, I can use metadata attributes such as kind:pdf and date:today to refine my search. \nI'm curious if there's a way to list all of these attributes that I can use with this syntax (attribute:value)\n\nA: Good question. There is a page on the Apple Developer site that goes into details of Spotlight metadata attributes. Though it's developer focussed I think you'd be able to draw inferences from the attribute keys listed there, e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*kMDItemKindDescription of the kind of item this file represents.\n\n*kMDItemAttributeChangeDateDate and time of the last change made to a metadata attribute\n\n*kMDItemContentCreationDateThe date and time that the content was created.\n\n*kMDItemContentModificationDateDate and time when the content of this item was modified.\n\n\nThe nice thing about this list is, that it's quite exhaustive, but it also means that developers would have needed to build this into their apps, so that Spotlight could accurately index the content.\nOn this list you also find more \"obscure\" (or lesser known) attributes, such as\n\n\n*\n\n*kMDItemCreatorName of the application used to create the document content. For example, \"Pages\" or \"Keynote\".\n\n*kMDItemKeywordsKeywords associated with this file. For example, \"Birthday\", \"Important\", etc.\n\n*kMDItemNumberOfPagesNumber of pages in the document.\n\n*kMDItemPageHeightHeight of the document page, in points (72 points per inch). For PDF files this indicates the height of the first page only.\n\n\nIf you're interested, there's also an oldish article over at the Superuser blog that gets into some of the details of using Spotlight including commands you can use from Terminal. There's a link in the article (about ⅔ down) pointing to a full list of attributes Spotlight keeps for you. That link is dead, but I've dug out a copy from the Wayback Machine for you. It's similar to the page on the Apple Developer site I provided before.\nI've tried some of these examples out and it turns out that the command line would allow you to use the listed attributes, such as kMDItemLastUsedDate. It also seems to allow for a much finer use, such as Boolean use and number ranges like \">=10\".\nI've subsequently successfully used TextContent:\"something\", Country:AU (for Australian content), date>20/1/2017 (that's 20 Jan 2017 in my lingo and filters everything after that date) and author:Alex (e.g. returns documents and emails created by me) in Spotlight's GUI. This article on Spotlight tips for El Capitan & Yosemite (slide 10) mainly mentions the kind: filter, though they also name the above date and author.\nWhat you can use very much depends on what developers of applications that save documents to disk have implemented using the metadata importer to provide Spotlight support.\n", "Q: Graphic corruption in Finder when opening specific directories Since yesterday, my MacBook started to have rendering issues in the Finder app when I open specific directories.\nI managed to fix some of them by removing the .DS_Store file in those directories.

I've had no issues installing other applications.\nHow can I install this application?\n\n\n\nA: Assuming that you are an admin on this Mac it may be that your app security settings need to be either relaxed or for you to give that app permission to install.\nGo to System Preferences > Security > General and click on the lock icon and authenticate. That app might be listed for you to explicitly give it permission to run. If not make sure that \"Allow Apps downloaded from: app store and identified developers\" is selected.\nYou might also want to ask the developer if they have seen this behavior and what their specific solution is.\n\nA: According to the wiki available on the official web-site, current user should be a member of the \"staff\" group to get rid of the \"Administrator of this Mac disabled your user account...\" message.\nCheck whether the user is a member of the \"staff\" group:\ndscl . -read /groups/staff | grep GroupMembership\n\nIf not, add the user to the \"staff\" group\":\nsudo dscl . -append /groups/staff GroupMembership <user>\n\nwhere <user> is the user's numeric ID or account name.\nHope this will be helpful as well.\n\nA: MacinCloud support provided a solution.

It’s a fraction of a second, but it’s enough that it can be as much as a word behind.\nThe lag occurs when I use Firefox, Notes or Atom, so it is clearly not related to a single application.\nI have recently upgraded to 10.13 High Sierra, as well as the supplementary update. I am running on a current model iMac.\nAs far as I am aware, I’m not running anything in the background which affects the keyboard. I even have background spelling turned off. And, of course, I have restarted.\nThis is not apparent on my MacBook which is similarly configured.\n\nA: The first thing I would try is starting your iMac in Safe Mode as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your iMac\n\n*Restart your iMac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. do you still notice the lag)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your iMac as normal\n\n*Test again to see if the lag still persists\n\n\nOnce you've tried the above let me know if the lag was still noticeable in Safe Mode and also when booted in normally again.\n\nA: This question is old, but still appears on the google search, so... I just had the same problem, in my case (the person asking the question doesn't specify) I have a magic keyboard connected wireless. Guess what's the problem?\n\nSimply switch the bluetooth off/on on the magic keyboard and the lag\nwill disappear.\n\nIt's a very annoying lag, I also thought it was a configuration issue or a program consuming too much memory.\n\nA: Try disabling Automatic graphics switching under battery settings. Seems to have fixed it for me.\n\nA: I'll put this as an separate answer, @Manngo comment was pointing me to solution.\nIn my case, in PhpStorm typing was horribly slow/laggy, after changed IDE font from Source Code Pro to other font, slowness disappeared.\n\nA: Check your Activity Monitor. Look for processes that have a high CPU usage.\nIn my case, the lag was caused by a VS Code process which used over 90% of the CPU. As soon as I quit VS Code, the lag stopped.\n", "Q: If I delete a voice memo from the Music app, will it also be deleted from the Voice Memo app? I want to remove the voice memos from my Music so it doesn't come up when playing songs, but I want to keep the voice memos.\nTo clarify, I did not purposely move my voice memos to the Music app.  When I synced my phone to iTunes, all of my voice memos were added to my music library, and when I synced again later on, those voice memos were added to my phone as songs.\nWill deleting voice memos from the Music.app also delete them in the Voice Memos.app?\nI use an iPhone 6s running iOS 11.\n\nA: I have tried it on iOS 11 with a new VoiceMemo. Here is what have I done:\nI have created a new voice memo, then I have synced the phone to the computer (running latest iTunes). The voice memo showed up in both my music collection in iTunes (even separate playlist) and within the songs on the phone. At least according to iTunes. But then I have tried to search for voice memos in the Music app, but it did not show up. Was this done with some old software?\nAnyhow deleting the voice memo on the computer - never mind what it says - will leave it on the phone. But of course, I suggest to back up. \n\nA: Save those memos to Dropbox. You will need the Dropbox app installed though. Once saved, then you can remove them without worrying about whether or not they are deleted. \nOnce you delete them, let us know if they are completely removed.\n", "Q: Accessing my contacts from broken iPhone? My iPhone 4 gave up its last hope and hasn't turned on in two weeks. I need to get my contacts, and it's not backed up. What do I do? Phone doesn't turn on, say it's charging but won't turn on. Left it plugged in for three days, still had red battery sign. I'm about to hook it up to a computer to find whether or not I can access its contents. \n\nA: Check your iCloud account to see if your contacts were backed up. You can go to www.icloud.com and then sign in with your Apple ID and password. Once you are in, you'll be able to view contacts and see if they are backed up.\nAs for the iPhone and its battery/power issues, you'll need to visit an Apple Store and get a new battery to replace the current one. Keep in mind you may have to pay for it since its likely that you no longer have a warranty on it. That should at least fix the issue. Also since support is no longer provided for the iPhone 4, they can choose to opt out of repairing it if they can't order the parts from the repair depot.\n***Make sure that when you charge your iPhone that you use the standard Apple charger that came with your iPhone. By using third-party chargers, they can create issues similiar to this one.\n", "Q: Can't boot from external APFS formatted SSD I have a Mac mini with macOS High Sierra and an external SSD drive connected via USB also with High Sierra on it.\nAfter converting the external SSD to APFS it doesn't boot anymore - my Mac can't see it as bootable and doesn't show it when booting with holding Option key.\nIf I go to System Preferences -> Startup Disk and choose the external drive I get an error:\nYou can’t change the startup disk to the selected disk.\n\nRunning bless to place boot files failed.\n\nIt seems that macOS can't install some boot files on that disk. Running First Aid on that disk in Disk Utility also produces an error:\nVerifying allocated space.\nerror: Underallocation Detected on Main device: (7219537+1) bitmap address (184373)\nSpace Verification failed.\nThe volume /dev/disk1s2 could not be verified completely.\n\nWhat can I do to restore those boot files and make the SSD finally work? I don't want to erase it and reinstall.\n\nA: Answering my own question... (happens a lot to me lately)\nI did manage to get it to boot from the broken SSD by first booting from a USB drive I prepared earlier with High Sierra install files on it and then installing to the SSD drive on top of the old system.\nThere was a weird thing happening during first reboot after the installation where my screen would flash and turn off. In fact I think I didn't really finish the installation, I think the installer didn't even copy all the files, but everything seems to work fine now so I'm pretty happy (and my old files and apps are in place).\n", "Q: FileVault Encryption Issues On High Sierra (APFS) I've recently updated to High Sierra and am now having issues with the encryption of my SSD.\nWhen upgrading I was prompted to create a new password for my user account, the dialog saying that I couldn't use the same password as my iCloud account anymore. This led to when I restarted my MacBook Pro, I had to log in twice. Once for the disk encryption, and one for the user account. This wasn't ideal for me, so I contacted Apple support to ask about the issue. They were only able to help me roll back to a previous Time Machine backup from before I updated, so now I'm running Sierra again. \nI suspect the option to use your iCloud password in conjunction with your user account (and other things...?? FileVault?) is what has caused the issue. Now that I'm up and running again on Sierra 10.12.6, I don't even see it as an option when I go to system preferences. \nMy question is, what is the best way for me to proceed to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have an encrypted SSD\n\n*Run the latest version of macOS (High Sierra)\n\n*Have as few passwords as possible (though I can use 1Password to store them if I need many separate passwords, it's just more messy.)\n\n\nA: If you have an encrypted drive before installing the OS you get that multiple login issue. If you do an install on a standard drive, then turn FileVault on, you won't have to double log in, as the user login will 'decrypt' the drive on its own.\nI believe that's what solved a similar issue for me. I did a second clean install, this time formatting APFS (without encryption).\n", "Q: After upgrading to High Sierra NTFS format mobile HDD fails to load I encountered a problem after upgrading to High Sierra. I have a mobile hard drive which is NTFS formatted (USB 3.0).\nWhen I connect my hard drive to the computer, it doesn't appear in Finder. It can be found in the Disk Utility but it is grayed out. Mobile hard disk is working properly because in other windows computer connection is fine, before the upgrade (macOS 10.12) can also be displayed in finder.\nHardware: MacBook Pro 13 2017 16 GB RAM & 256 GB SSD without Touch Bar.\n\nA: I also have similar problem, but luckily, it can read the drives. Perhaps your drive was not mounted. Now I temporarily use virtual Windows through VirtualBox to write to the drives while waiting for a complete solution.\nMy machine is iMac late 2015.\n", "Q: Can I buy one time membership of iCloud to backup my mac? I was going to buy an external hard drive to backup my mac to upgrade to macos sierra , but I was wondering if I could back it up with iCloud (200gb) account, then download it back to my mac paying just $3?

Taking a concrete example, say I run brew install git, I now have \n> /usr/local/bin/git --version\ngit version 2.14.2\n> git --version\ngit version 2.13.5 (Apple Git-94)\n\nTo use the more recent (git 2.14), it's tedious to use /usr/local/bin/git. Also, giving more priority to /usr/local/bin on my own may have undesirable side effects.\nWhat's the standard way to run updated Homebrew programs when they collide with ones already on macOS? For python I've seen that Homebrew avoids collisions by requiring users to type either python2 or python3. This is less clear for the case of git.\n\nA: General convention is in fact to put /usr/local/bin ahead of /usr/bin.  This is doable via editing the /etc/path file or sudo launchctl config user path \"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\".  This will cause executables in /usr/bin to be shadowed by the ones in /usr/local/bin.  The Homebrew FAQ suggests this. \nHomebrew recipes will deliberately not link any programs into /usr/local/bin that could potentially cause system-wide conflicts (homebrew executables are actually installed in /usr/local/Cellar and symlinked to /usr/local/bin).  When you install a potentially conflict-causing package, homebrew will warn you about it, and say something to the effect of \"We didn't automatically link this package.  If you really want to, you can run `brew link ...\" Homebrew is generally pretty good about being respectful of existing system packages.\nAs an empirical anecdote, I have always shadowed /usr/bin with /usr/local/bin and have never run into any issues.  YMMV, of course.\n", "Q: How to resize Safari address bar on macOS Sierra or newer?

Music playing will stop suddenly and Bluetooth connections such as AirPods will be lost. The phone is either entirely black or \"graphically black\" with a spinning wheel for about 20–30 seconds. It does not appear to be a full shutdown, because no reboot is required (i.e. the Apple logo isn't displayed). The phone returns to the Lock Screen after the black screen or spinning wheel.\n\n\nIt should be noted that my phone has battery problems described here and here, which is to say that in iOS 10 the Phone would suddenly completely die at 20%. While the issue could definitely be related to the faulty battery, it does not appear to be similar, and these new shutdowns occur also at near-fully loaded battery levels.\nAnecdotally, I don't have much to report other than that the Lock Button seems to trigger a freeze sometimes, but as stated above shutdowns can happen by themselves without any particular action by me (except streaming music).\nNote: This problem did not occur in iOS 10 or similar versions with the very same phone.\n\nEdit: I have not replaced any part of the iPhone, e.g. I don't use a third-party replacement screen. The iOS 11.0.3 update that was intended to address issues relating to replacement screens, did not help.\n\nA: There are lots of issues right now with iOS 11, especially with the iPhone 6S. A quick look at the iFixit Answers Forum will convince you of that. Of course, these are just a tiny percentage of all iPhone owners so it's not like there is a pandemic going on. If your screen has been replaced with an aftermarket screen in the past, this may be the source of the problem. \nThis blog post explains:\nThe problem appears to be caused by the software driver of the Touch Controller IC that is embedded into the display assembly. Aftermarket screens produced with Hancai or Tianma LCD's using the Aichungjia (a Flex/IC manufacturer) \"copy\" driver appear to be incompatible with iOS 11. This driver is said to be unable to handle the iOS configuration and therefore shutting down and causing the lack of Touch functionality. OEM or Original grade iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 series replacement screens are not affected by this problem.\nI don't believe it is battery related although you should check this Apple official website to see if you are elegible for a free battery replacement. Unfortunately, it is now too late to downgrade to iOS 10 as Apple have stopped signing those versions.\n\nA: Actually, it is not too late for you to downgrade to iOS 10. As of now, Apple still signs iOS 10.3.3 for the iPhone 6S and some older models. I did so last night on my 6S, because iOS 11 rendered my phone borderline unusable. \nAs Minho mentions, there are a lot of issues with iOS 11 right now, so I'm going to wait until Apple resolves at least some of them before updating again.\nNote: I wanted to make this a comment on Minho's answer, but don't have enough reputation yet.\n\nA: I recommend two options for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*To call AppleCare and have us check and see if your phone qualifies for a repair/replacement or a battery replacement since freezing is often signs of poor battery health.\n\n\nor \n\n\n*Backup then restore your iPhone.\n\n\nThe second option you can do yourself, make sure you have an iCloud backup of your iPhone and then use iTunes on a computer (Mac or PC/Windows) and restore your iPhone. This will erase the entire phone (hence why a backup is recommended 1st) then it will install iOS 11 with a fresh install. Not with layers of patches, which is what you currently have). After the restore is done, and the iPhone says hello, then you can set up the iPhone and then restore from iCloud backup. That should help with the software problems. Ultimately you'll want to do this before you contact Apple since they will recommend that you do that 1st.\nOnce you've done the restore if the issues persist, then call AppleCare and let them know everything you are experiencing and they will send the info to the technical team and have them investigate it further to see whats wrong with the iPhone.\n\nA: The issue appears to have disappeared with the update to iOS 11.1.\nPresumably this specific issue was a bug introduced with iOS 11 affecting certain iPhone devices.\nAs stated in other answers, there may be other problems with similar diagnosis that may be due to other issues e.g. third-party replacement screens.\n", "Q: Menu bar turns red on secondary screen I recently updated to macOS High Sierra recently and noticed that sometimes there is a red bar/background over the right side of the menu bar, near time and Siri icons.

I have a MacBook, with el Capitan.\nI am in Finder, looking at a folder which contains a lot of files. I have arranged by kind, which means that I have to scroll horizontally to see all my folders.

You have to scroll through using the arrow keys, by two-finger dragging, or using Shift-scrollwheel (I assume—I don't have a mouse to hand).

Does anybody know what the name of this technology is?\n\nA: I skimmed the patents linked above and here’s my naive interpretation of the technology. It’s essentially a finely detailed QR code, or similar, but rather than using coloured squares, the information is encoded by rapidly alternating complimentary colours such that the human eye doesn’t notice. This also allows higher information density by allowing the subtleties of the particular alternating colours chosen to encode additional degrees of freedom. Neither the rounded density distribution nor the wandering, orbiting movement of the particles is mentioned in the patent, it might be just for aesthetics which would be an Apple thing to do. What is mentioned is that this code can be embedded into a background image (and presumably an animation), without the image appearing different to the human eye. I wonder how much of the spherical orbiting “galaxy” shape is just smoke and mirrors to give you something to point your camera at while the real magic happens invisibly? We need someone to film the code up close, with a high speed camera - the patent mentions a flicker rate of 60hz so any footage above 120fps should do the trick. \n\nA: The technology can be thought of very much like an animated QR-code. The main principle of data encoding is very much like QR-codes, but obviously with the difference that as time goes forward, the displayed data changes as an animation.\nIn addition there seems to be the use of a neat trick with two different colors shown in quick alternation, which makes it possible for Apple to \"hide\" or make less obvious the clues that are used for the receiver of the data to synchronize with the signal (i.e. figure out where the boundaries of the encoded data is).\nWith a traditional QR code these sync markers are much more evident as they are big black square boxes with white borders that are set different places in the code to make it easy for the receiver to figure out what's encoded data, and what's not part of the code.\nMuch more details are available in these two patent applications by Apple:\nUS Patent 9,022,291\nUS Patent 9,022,292\n\nA: Apple's proximity-based process for transferring data\nAutomatic Setup is Apple's proximity-based process for transferring data, settings, and content from an old device to a new one. You can use Automatic Setup on your iPhone, Apple Watch, or Apple TV.\nApple's Automatic Setup feature began as an easier way for users to set up the Apple TV with \"tap-to-set-up,\" which let you use your iPhone's sensors to quickly connect to your Apple TV and automatically enter in data like an Apple ID and Wi-Fi network. Since then, the feature has evolved and expanded to cover not only the Apple TV, but new iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch models as well.\n\nAutomatic Setup is great because it lets users skip much of the\nform-filling present in older versions of setting up new devices — you\nshouldn't have to manually enter Wi-Fi network names and passwords,\nApple IDs, or settings from previous devices. It's also\nproximity-based, keeping that data secure by requiring you to\nphysically have both old and new devices in the same location.\nApple uses a slightly different method to automatically set up each\ndevice, depending on whether it's an iPhone or iPad, Apple Watch, or\nApple TV.\n\nVisit this site for how different devices are setup.\n", "Q: Can't download apps on iTunes So I went on the App section on my Mac's iTunes, and clicked download... asked for my AppleID, and I typed it in.

I'm at a total loss to explain this strange incident.  I have a dedicated Mac Mini as a media server to the house, and it has a 5TB external Seagate drive hanging off of it.  The drive is partitioned into two partitions, one called \"Media\" which is 3TB and contains our household movies, TV shows, etc.  The other is called \"TM iMac\" and is a network volume I use to backup my personal workstation (an iMac) via Time Machine.  It's been set up this way for years, never had a hitch until yesterday.\nYesterday I noticed that my iMac kept complaining about a problem connecting to a share on the media server.  I finally investigated further last night and found that my iMac was failing to connect to the TM iMac network volume.  The last successful TM backup was yesterday at 9am, and nothing unusual happened all day.  I checked the media server and sure enough, the TM iMac volume was missing.  But that's when things got really weird.  I ran Disk First Aid and found that, according to it, I don't have a 5TB drive with 2 partitions connected, I have a single 3TB drive with 1 partition - the Media partition.  All verify/repairs pass with flying colors.\nWhat the heck has happened here?  How has my 5TB drive suddenly turned itself into a 3TB drive?  How can DFA think it's anything other than what it is?  It would be strange but at least make some sense, if one partition was lost somehow and my 5TB drive reported only a single partition of 3TB in use.  But DFA actually says it's a 3TB Seagate drive, not the 5TB that it actually is!\nIs this some strange indication of the drive beginning to fail?  The drive was purchased new and put in service in March of 2016.  Should I nuke the drive, reformat, and restore from backup (I have backups of the Media partition)?

I was right that my TM drive was 5TB, but what I had forgotten was that my Media drive, was a completely separate, older 3TB drive that was just somewhat hidden in my media cabinet.  It looks like the TM drive had disappeared due to a cabling issue of some sort.  Unplugging and then plugging back in its USB, caused it to suddenly reappear as expected.  \nOh well, I'm now also the proud owner of a new 8TB drive (which was cheaper than the 5TB drive was 18 months ago!) so I guess I'll look at this as the universe's way of telling me once and for all that I need to stop running out of space on my Media drive.

Here's a 2014 review of it on Cult of Mac, so it's been around and working for some time.\n\nA: Apple maintains public-facing webpages for all apps in the App Store at itunes.apple.com. If you use Google or an equivalent search engine and limit the results to that domain, you can effectively search the App Store from any web browser.\nFor example, if you search the itunes.apple.com domain for \"to do\", you'll get results for Microsoft To-Do, Wunderlist, Do!, etc. Click any of those links and you'll get effectively the same listing page as what you would get in the App Store app on iOS devices.\n\nA: I found a link that seems to work.

When I installed MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra), the icon changed to the icon depicting my laptop model (MacBook Pro 13\" with Touch Bar). I changed the icon back to the Dock.

If you are already signed into the other device with the same account. Go to settings on the device, then your name (or iCloud then your name) and look for password and security. Once you find that, select change password. If you try to do it through the website it may have you go through account recovery, which takes some time before they let you reset your password.\n(If it doesnt ask for a verification code then you'll need to choose reset password and ask to either send to email or answer security questions to reset the password.)\nIf you cant get the password for that account via either method then you'll need to provide Apple with a proof of purchase.

Typically it goes quite well; I connect my phone to wifi, and the photos (all of them), automatically upload to Google Photos. \nRecently, I also purchased a Cannon t6 camera. After taking pictures with that camera, I transfer them to my phone. I do not resize them during the transfer. They are all shot in RAW but to my knowledge are changed to JPEG during the transfer. \nHere's the problem, all of my other pictures in my camera roll just show up in Google Photos as soon as I open the app. The pictures from the t6 that were not resized do not show up. A quick Google search of this revealed that it could be due to size or formatting, I checked this by emailing one of the images to myself, it was less than 1MB (367KB) and it was JPEG. \nI just updated the Google Photos app today and that did not fix the issue. I am in the process of doing an update to iOS 11.0.2. I also tried turning my phone off and back on, that did not fix the issue either. \nHas anyone had this happen before? If so, how did you fix it? \n\nA: The best way to fix that is to use the web for uploading to Google Photos and not the iPhone since the iPhone needs to compress it, then Google Photos compresses it even more.\nUse http://photos.google.com and make sure that you are signed in to your account. The quality of those images should also be much better as well.\n", "Q: iCloud Family Sharing: Notifications to others member if you leave?

I struggle with procrastination on sites like reddit, youtube, and netflix so I want to block them. I know I can do this by modifying /etc/hosts to redirect to 127.0.0.1, but I still can and do change the hosts file back. Is there some way I can set a password for /etc/hosts so that I can not sudo edit it? Alternatively can someone recommend a better solution to block these sites? I use High Sierra and Chrome.\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: What you wish to achieve sounds like a duplicate of this question. There are complications such as SIP to consider these days. More trouble than it's worth.\nIt would be more effective to 'firewall' those sites in some way that does not rely on a password that you may forget, or be tempted to revert when you should be concentrating your attentions elsewhere. Fortunately, as the other question stated, there's an app (or many) to do that.\nI personally used Self Control some years ago when trying to get coursework done. It's free. There are other similar apps out there, some paid-for for the sake of extra features, though I feel those extra features are just another avenue of procrastination.\n", "Q: Recovering Notes from Water Damaged iPhone I washed my iPhone SE with my clothes in the washing machine on warm for about an hour. It didn't go through the dryer, but sat in the wet clothes for an extra hour after the cycle was complete.\nI know there is a ton of information out there on the internet for recovering a water soaked phone, but many of the tips seem to be contradictory. (Use an oven on low temperature. No, an oven will damage it more, use a hair dryer! Wrong, a hairdryer will mess it up, use compressed air and rice. etc...) Its been sitting in a bowl of rice last night and today, but I'm concerned that it won't be enough. Any suggestions?\nIf not, I would desperately like to try to recover the notes from it. I keep a lot of very important notes on my iPhone, including all of my ideas and lots of information for business and school. The notes are not backed up on my computer or iCloud. The notes are equally(if not more) important than the phone itself.\nIs there any way to recover my notes from the phone?\n\nA: Have a technician (not an apple one) carefully open up the iPhone (hopefully you dont have a warranty). Remove the SIM card and battery. Then lay the halves flat and then use a vacuum cleaner with a long nozzle to dry out the moisture. Make sure its on low and that its not close to the phone. If too close it will short circuit the phone, making the motherboard useless. Make sure that there is no heat.\nI've heard silica gel works also if you find an iPhone water damage professional, they can fix the issue. Just make sure they offer you a warranty.\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Save-a-Wet-Cell-Phone\n\nA: Btw you could immediately have disconnect the battery from board if possible. That will prevent further short circuits.\nOne thing I can suggest is, replacing battery and try turning on if possible. In most water damage scenarios battery is the fault of not turning on.\nIf you don't have that option running into service center is the best option better than its late. \n\nA: Your best chance at recovering data is getting your phone to someone who knows how to properly decontaminate the logic board. Rice, silica gel and other desiccants don't work. All they do is allow the water to fester and corrode the solder balls under the IC's. No amount of heating, drying, bags of rice for days or even vacuuming will change this. If you fail to resist the temptation and actually power on your device, then you will blow components due to water or corrosion residue shorting the power rails. I have written extensively about this on iFixit.\nTo start, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your phone and remove the logic board (iFixit has repair guides)\n\n*Inspect the logic board, especially around the connectors and look for corrosion. \n\n*Inspect both sides of the board. Unfortunately, 80% of the board is covered in shields. That's usually where the damage is occurring. \n\n*Put your board in a container with >90% isopropyl alcohol and let it sit for 30-60 minutes. \n\n*Use a soft brush, like a toothbrush and lightly brush away any corrosion you see. \n\n*Rinse in alcohol and repeat. \n\n*Let it air dry for a day. Re-assemble and hope for the best.\n\n\nA professional repair shop that does water damage repair may be able to recover your phone or the data because they have access to pro-level ultrasonic baths and specialized cleaners as well as the skills to troubleshoot your board. Many shops have a no fix/no fee policy so you don't have to spend money to find out if the phone is fixable or not.\n", "Q: Unable to find an album in iTunes while I see it using web browser So I'm in Australia and I bought Apple Music, I wanted to pull a particular album I really enjoy. \n\nArtist - Recoil, title - 1+2\n\nWhile I can see it in browser by googling it.\n\nAbove screenshot is from iTunes via browser where I'm not logged in. \nI'm unable to see it in my iTunes app on iPhone and Mac when I search using phrases \"recoil\" and / or \"1+2.\n\nThe last one in search results is Hydrology, while (1+2 - the oldest LP) should appear on the very right but it does not. Is it because of some licensing issues in Australia Apple Store? What could be the issue. Could other people from different countries try to search it and check if it appears?\n\nA: Your link to the iTunes web preview points to the US store. Looks like that the album is not available in the Australian store. Some albums are region specific.

My boss is going to make a very long audio recording using the stock audio recording app on an iPhone. I am worried that she might run out of space on her phone, especially if the app records in HQ.\nMy boss is far away, and I do not have an iOS device myself to test this on.\nDoes the app have different settings for audio quality?\nHow much space does the audio created by the app usually take up per minute? The recording will be of spoken words.\n\nA: The amount of space any recording takes will depend on a number of factors. And, even the exact same recording can take up different amounts of space depending on the drive it's stored on and how it was formatted.\nIn my experience, a one minute audio voice recording using the Voice Memos app on an iPhone 6s with iOS 11 installed will typically take between 650KB and 700KB. That is based on one person speaking into the phone while they're in a quiet room. Note that the amount of background noise, distance from the microphone, etc can all affect the amount of space required.\nThe Voice Memos app saves audio as a MPEG 4 Audio file (i.e. a file with the .m4a extension).\n", "Q: Sierra: can't change Magic Mouse scrolling speed Since one of the recent updates I no longer see the option to change the scrolling speed of my Magic Mouse.

If you want the audio to come out of the monitor, adjust its volume directly (or connect speakers). Otherwise, use either the Volume item in the menu bar (the speaker icon) or the Sound system preference to change your audio output device to \"Internal Speakers\".\n\n\nA: Try running the following command:\nsudo killall coreaudiod\n\nand then restart coreaudiod like this:\nsudo -u _coreaudiod /usr/sbin/coreaudiod &\n\nThis will kill the Core Audio daemon (which is a system-level process, so escalating your privileges to super-user levels using sudo is necessary.)\n\nA: Try to open System Preferences -> Open Sound -> Click Output -> Switch devices to headphones or speaker.\n\nA: I fix from Sound setting from System Preference and it works:\n- Go to System Preference\n- Go to Sound\n- Select Internal Speaker Type Built In\nThanks\n\nA: I just fixed this by going into the audio midi setup. \n - Click the + symbol on the bottom of the window.\n - select create Multi-Output  Device.\n - highlight newly added device \n - click gears icon on bottom of window\n - select use this device for sound output.\nIt was absolute dumb luck messing with settings but it works!\n\nA: I've got a 2017 MacBook Pro and recently bought a Dell U2719DC. I bought it because of the single USB-C cable into my MBP idea. Looking into how to control sound from the monitor, I tried the SoundFlower/Bed and although it did work, I found it to be a really ugly solution.\nI was able to keep my 1-cable dream alive through buying an M-Audio Micro DAC for $60AUD (you can get much, much cheaper USB DAC's). It's just a USB based line out device that plugs into my monitors hub at the back, and gives me control over the output level without the need for any sketchy drivers or software - just plug it in and you're done.\nThis solution is probably not for everyone, and particularly limited to those with USB-C monitors, but I thought I'd share anyway.\n", "Q: Xcode organizer shows crash reports of unsupported device We launched our iOS camera app only for iPhones and we do not support any other apple devices. We have telephony in  UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities which iPads don't support.(Check here) \nBut in Xcode -> Organizer -> Crashes we are receiving crash logs from iPads.\nIn iTunes connect analytics, the number of app units vs device shows 100% iPhone. So where are we getting these iPad crash logs from? How can someone download the app on iPad if we are not supporting it?\nPS: The logs have correct info i.e., if we test our app on iPad the crash log we get matches the crash log in Xcode Organizer.\n\nA: iPhone-only apps can be downloaded from the App Store to an iPad regardless of whether or not you support using it the iPad.  This is different than iPad-only apps because those can't be installed on an iPhone (non-jailbreak).\nA user simply has to select to download the iPhone version to their iPad and they can download it.  The app will display on their iPad in 'compatibility mode', that's as a smaller (screen size) app or magnified to fit the iPad screen.\nJust because people are using iPads doesn't mean you have to provide them support.  You can always refuse support to someone if they've used your app on an 'unsupported device'.  Just be sure to clearly call out that it's not designed to run on iPads in your app description.\nIn iTunesConnect, you're only seeing users who have approved to share analytics and logs with both Apple and the app's developer.  That audience might only contain people with iPhones that agreed to share the logs so you're only going to see iPhones in the logs (this is why I use a 3rd-party analytics tool in addition to the regular ones from Apple).  \n", "Q: External monitor stays black after \"locking\" (or sleeping) I have a Mac Book Pro (latest 2017 touchbar model) which I am using in clamshell mode. Meaning: its lid is closed, and I work with two external monitors.\nBoth monitors are a bit older; they have DVI ports which connect via DVI/HDMI cable. Monitor 1 is then connected via a Kensington USB-C dock, Monitor 2 is connected via a StarTech HDMI<->USB-C adapter.\nMy problem: as soon as I lock my screen ... Monitor 2 will stay black. Meaning: I come back, I log into the system ... Monitor 1 works just as before. But Monitor 2 stays black. Although MacOs somehow still thinks the monitor is \"there\": when I turn to \"displays\" and look at \"arrangement\" - it shows all monitors. And windows that I \"left\" on the desktop space on monitor 2 won't show up on the other monitor. \nI guess this might be caused by the chain of hardware I am using - but still it is extremely annoying to come back and find that monitor to be useless (I have to restart MacOs in order to get it back working).\nAny ideas how to overcome / debug this issue are welcome.\n( edit: same thing happens when I \"sleep\" instead of lock )\n\nA: When I faced this issue, I pulled the StarTech Adaptors in and out multiple times and the issue would resolve itself. Now I found a better solution as described below.\nI  went to System Preferences -> Display -> Arrangement and toggled the Mirror Displays checkbox (ie check and then un-check it again).\n\n\nA: Latest workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wake your mac.

Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nIf you find the above makes no difference you could try booting into Safe Mode and testing to see if the behaviour is repeated while in that mode.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your MBP into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. use your computer as normal and then lock the screen, etc)\n\n*When you're finished exit Safe Mode by restarting your MBP as normal\n\n*Test again while booted normally\n\n\nLet me know how you go - in particular whether the issue still persists in Safe Mode.\n\nA: I know this question is almost a half year old. However I think it could be useful to someone to know, how I solved this problem (black screen on external monitor after locking).\nIn my opinion this problem is not exclusively related to Apple or MacOS. I had the same problems also with Windows 10 on a Dell XPS 13 9360 laptop. My docking station is a Plugable Thunderbolt 3 Docking Station with two external monitors connected: One via Thunderbolt 3 to HDMI cable and the other via Displayport to DVI cable.\nMy solution to fix the black screen problem (effected my second monitor connected via DVI) was to install the newest DisplayLink driver:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect the docking station\n\n*Execute the DisplayLink Installation Cleaner.\n\n*Install the latest driver from the official download site. Drivers for macOS, Windows, Android, Chrome OS and Ubuntu are available.\n\n*Connect your docking station again\n\n*Reboot the system\n\n", "Q: Just got a new SSD installed into my macbook pro, how to use?

I haven't found any solution (not online or in the keyboard settings), does anyone has any idea?\nThanks!\n\nA: If you are in High Sierra and using the Apple \"Hebrew\" or \"Hebrew qwerty\" input source, you should get ₪ via Shift-7.  For & you have to do caps lock shift 7.\nIf you are using the \"Hebrew PC\" layout, ₪ will be Option 4 (and Shift 7 will give you &).  \n\nA: System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources will let you add multiple international keyboard configurations, and both Hebrew and Hebrew (QWERTY) map the ₪ symbol to shift-7. In that preference pane, you can also add the Input menu to your menu bar, which will show you what keyboard input is active with a little flag icon, and it will let you switch between them easily.\nTo get the ₪ sign regardless of what keyboard input is selected, you could go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Text and add a text replacement shortcut like \";sheq\" or \";שקל\" and paste the ₪ character in.

It's not a function of the computer but a failure of the internal component(s) of the power supply itself.\nWhy does it fail?  IBM engineers addressed that very point in a presentation - Why do Power Supplies Fail, and What can be done about it?\nReasons range from environmental factors, quality/age of the components, and the spacing/location of components (design).\nYou've already done your diagnostics (trying a different one) and you have narrowed down the issue to the MagSafe adapter itself.  It's time to get a new one.\n", "Q: How to launch Twitter app from Tweet URL in Reminders in iOS 11 I am using 6th gen iPod touch.\nWhen I was using iOS 10.3, Tweet URLs in Reminders showed with Twitter icons, and I could open Twitter app from Reminders by tapping Tweet URLs.\nFrom when I updated to iOS 11, Tweet URLs in Reminders showed without icons, and I could not open neither Twitter app nor Safari from Reminders by tapping Tweet URLs.\nHow can I launch Twitter app with tap Tweet URL in Reminders in iOS 11 ?\n\nA: Universal link from Reminder app is now re-activated on iOS 11.2 and Twitter 7.12.1.\n", "Q: Stop the Outlook 2016 Reminders window from being \"always on top\" It looks like Outlook 2016's calendar Reminders window is set to \"always on top\" and there's nothing I can do about it. But that seems crazy. Googling isn't finding other people complaining of the same thing, and I can't find a setting for it, so I wonder if it's specific to my machine. Can anyone confirm?\nIs there a way to force it to stop being always on top? Maybe an app that can change window behaviors? Or an AppleScript option?\n\nA: If you switch to the Outlook app then Hide (⌘H) Outlook, the Reminders window will be hidden along with the rest of the app.\nIf you switch back to Outlook again the Reminders will return to being always on top, so it will occlude other apps again if you switch back away from Outlook other than by Hiding it.\n(I figured this out from one of the far more numerous complaints about Reminders NOT interrupting work, where KiltedTim recommended not hiding Outlook)\n", "Q: How does macOS select a name for a Time Machine backup? I see a folder\n/Volumes/WD MyPassport/Backups.backupdb/GregoryMBpro\n\nand /Volumes has\n~/ > ls -l /Volumes\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x+  3 root    wheel   94 21 Sep 09:08 Preboot\ndrwxrwxr-x  16 gregory staff  632  2 Nov  2014 WD MyPassport\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root    wheel    1  7 Oct 22:37 elcapitan -> /\n~/ > \n\nwhile the \"Computer Name\" I chose under Sharing in System Preferences is \"Gregory's MacBook Pro\".\n(Note to self: it's a bad idea to name a volume after an OS release that will be upgraded sooner or later.)\nWhat is the mapping between these names? In particular, if I change the name of either the volume or the computer name (under Sharing), would I inadvertently start a new Time Machine backup?\nRelevant\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine Backup Precautions\n\nA: The name of the Time Machine ’backup disk’ (‘WD MyPassport’ in your example) does not matter. You can rename this as you wish and Time Machine will continue to back up as usual. References to the backup disk name in places such as Time Machine preference pane will be updated accordingly automatically. Per tmutil man page:\n\nIn Mac OS X, HFS+ volumes have a persistent UUID that is assigned when the file system is created. Time Machine uses this identifier to make an association between a source volume and a snapshot volume.\n\nThe computer name (‘GregoryMBpro’) is used as the ‘machine directory’. Like the backup disk, you can rename your computer such as from the Sharing preference pane and Time Machine will continue to back up to the previous computer name. This is because…\n\nMachine directories and sparsebundles are owned by one computer at a time, and are tracked by unique identifiers rather than computer name, host name, or ethernet address.\n\nHowever, unlike renaming the backup disk, renaming your computer doesn't rename the actual directory path used for backups — rename your computer and it will continue to back up but to the old computer name.\n", "Q: I know my apple ID but don't know my iCloud id or password, is it the same? I am preparing to buy a new iPhone but the salesmen said I need the iCloud address and password.  I have no idea what that is.  Is it the same as my apple id?\n\nA: An Apple ID is used to log in to iCloud services if you choose to use them. You can have multiple Apple IDs, but one is signified as the ’primary’ account and used for iCloud. When one asks for an ‘iCloud ID’, they refer to the Apple ID used for iCloud.\nIn this case, it seems a device has activation lock. You'll need the owner's Apple ID used for iCloud to unlock the device before you can use it.\nNever give your Apple ID password to anyone.\n\nA: He is referencing your Apple ID, hopefully. It sounds like it may be activation locked, but that wouldn't require your information. \nYour iCloud email address IS NOT your Apple ID 100% of the time. For example, my Apple ID is @gmail.com, but I created a separate @icloud.com/@me.com email. So it's not always the same.\nGrab the IMEI, and run it through Apple's activation lock checker and the database for stolen devices. \n", "Q: Messages with three dashes get cut off My wife sent me a video of my son saying something, to which I responded:\nWhat's he saying? Mommy read --- book?\n\nA few seconds after I sent the message, the text \"book?\" (and possibly the last dash) disappeared from my sent message. My wife says that she originally saw the word \"book\", but when she went back and looked, it had been removed for her too.\nDoes this happen for anyone else? Is this intended, or a bug?\n\nA: This is a known bug with Apple's Smart Punctuation, as explained here. To avoid this issue in the future, go to Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> switch off Smart Punctuation. This will also remove the \"press space twice to make a period\" functionality, unfortunately.\nFrom using the iOS 11.1 beta, it appears that this issue will be fixed in the 11.1 update.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade my Mac but not to High Sierra? My late 2012 MacMini i7 is running Yosemite 10.10.5. I have some apps that need at least 10.11, but I've read reviews saying upgrading to High Sierra, the newly released OS, is not recommended.\nIs there a way I can install a newer version until such time as the newest one has been out a while?\n[EDIT]\nUnfortunately I have not previously downloaded any macOS installers for El Capitan or Sierra.\n\nA: Since you've clarified that you've never downloaded an installer for a later version of macOS, then you've only got three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download an installer from a 3rd party (not recommended)\n\n*Acquire an installer from a trusted friend or other trusted source\n\n*Try your luck at an Apple Store (or other authorised outlet) to see if you can find one willing to do the upgrade for you\n\n\nThere may be other workarounds open to you. For example, if you have access to another Mac (yours or a friend's) that is not capable of running macOS High Sierra, but is capable of running El Capitan or Sierra, then you could start your Mac mini in Target Disk Mode and set it as the default startup disk for the other Mac. Then you could use the optioncommandR startup keyboard combination to upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with that Mac. You'd have to make sure you select the Mac mini's hard drive as the install location.\nOf course, I can't stress enough how important it is you have a backup regime in place, be it via Time Machine or some other solution.\n\nA: If you have previously downloaded installers for newer but not current versions of MacOS (e.g. for other Macs), you can download and install those from the Purchased page.\n", "Q: Combine multiple txts into one I'm trying to combine multiple txts into a big file. I want them to be put in sequence but this seems not to work properly.\nAt this time I tried from the terminal:cat *.txt >merged.txt but this seems to concatenate the files randomly.\nIn my folder I have all the files named with sequential numbers (from 1.txt to 10000.txt). Am I missing anything?\n\nA: Use zsh with extended globs—and enable numeric sorting of the glob expansions with the (n) glob qualifier:\nzsh -c 'cat *.txt(n) > merged.txt'\n\nYou can get more specific with your globs, also:\nzsh -c 'cat <1-10000>.txt(n) > merged.txt'\n\nSee man zshexpn for full details.\n\nA: Another possible answer could be:\nls | sort -n | xargs cat > merged.txt\n\n\nOn a GNU/Linux system you can do ls -v | xargs cat > merged.txt, but this is specific to the GNU version of ls and does not work for BSD ls.\n\nA: Globbing isn't random, it's guaranteed to be alphabetical (a.k.a. lexicographic order according to your locale), which is different from numeric sorting order.\nYou can use brace expansion for this.  Replace '10' with the number of the last file.\ncat {1..10}.txt > merged.txt\n\nThis uses bash brace expansion, which you can read about at LESS='+/Brace Expansion' man bash.\nNote that unlike file globs, the brace expansion will generate arbitrary strings which need not be existing files; in this case that means you will get errors if there are files missing from the sequence (e.g. if 7.txt does not exist).  However, this won't affect the contents of merged.txt which will be produced as expected.\n\nA: Heads up. If the files are indeed numbered 1 - 10000 then the operating system is sorting your files in the order of the first number:\n1.txt\n11.txt\n12.txt\n...\n19.txt\n100.txt\n...\n2.txt\n20.txt\n21.txt\netc.\nYou would have to rename files as 00001, 00002 and so on.\n\nA: Normally, you don't parse the output of ls, but as your filenames contain no whitespace or \"unusual\" characters, we can do this:\nshopt -s extglob\nls +([0-9]).txt | sort -n | xargs cat > merged.txt\n\nThe +([0-9]) is a bash extended glob pattern to match only one or more numbers.\nWith GNU ls (available via homebrew in the coreutils package)\nls -v +([0-9]).txt | xargs cat > merged.txt\n\n\nA: In command promt:\n\ncd \"path to directory\" (Enter)\n\ncopy *.txt result.txt (Enter)\n", "Q: Apple ID won't show correctly in Keychain Access I was going through keychain access sorting through passwords and such and I came across a strange problem.

I know my Apple ID password, but for some reason I am very bugged by this and wanted answers :)! Haha Thanks to all who respond for my OCD's sake...\n\nA: Apple stores a hash or key so that people’s accounts won’t be compromised.\nYou’ll need to find another place it’s stored to look up that password.\n", "Q: macOS app for showing external HDD usage statistics? I'm planning on selling a used external HDD on eBay.  Are there any applications for Mac out there (preferably free) that can show me statistics about the usage history for the drive so that I can let potential buyers know the condition more precisely?\n\nA: By usage stats I'm assuming you mean SMART stats...\nDriveDx has a trial version that will show SMART stats. But you have to load a kext to see USB attached disks. That's a common issue with all the 3rd party programs. \nIt works well, and will allow you to do short & extended self-tests even in the trial version. It will save a report you could email to your potential buyer (Actions | Save Drive Health Report).\n\nA: In short...\nNo.\nIt's not so much a problem with an App that can get this information (SMART info), it is a problem with the USB to SATA controller itself providing the necessary interface to actually get the info.  See this relevant answer for reference.\nYour best bet is to get a Thunderbolt to eSATA adapter and just use the built in commands on your Mac:\ndiskutil info diskX | grep -i smart\nor an App like Disk Warrior or Disk Drill (any drive diagnostic app will work, technically).\nWhat I do is I have an old Dell PC for testing out different components.  I have FreeBSD installed on a small drive and use the second/third SATA ports for testing/cloning drives. \n", "Q: OSX Server File Sharing allowing more access than configured I am working on a computer used as a server running 10.10.5.\nI created a folder on the server as follows.\nFolder List \nShared-Folder1\nShared-Folder2\nShared-Folder3\nShared-Folder4\n\nUser List\nUserA\nUserB\nUserC\nPermissions List (Read/write) \nShared-Folder1: UserA, UserB \nShared-Folder2: UserB, UserC \nShared-Folder3: UserA, UserC\nWhen I login to the server using UserA's credentials using my Windows 10 computer over the network, I see Shared-Folder1, Shared-Folder2, Shared-Folder3.  \nI made sure that every folder's pre-defined groups in the permissions section is set to \"No Access\" and all permissions are assigned by username and not by groups.\nWhen I make changes to Shared-Folder2, UserA also sees the changes.  \nThe problem is that UserA should NOT be able to see Shared-Folder2 at all but they clearly have access to it.\nIs this a bug in OSX 10.10.5?\nDoes anybody know how to fix this?\nThanks in advance.\n\nls -lae \"Shared-Folder2\" output: \n\nMini-Server:Raid Storage Admin-User$ ls -lae \"Shared-Folder2\"       total 16\ndrwx------+  3 Admin-User         staff   102 Oct 10 16:03 .\n 0: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit\n 1: group:com.apple.sharepoint.group.3 allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\n 2: user:UserA allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\n 3: user:Shared-Folder2 allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\ndrwxrwxr-x  18 Admin-User         staff   680 Oct 10 16:04 ..\n-rw-r--r--@  1 Shared-Folder2  staff  6148 Oct 10 16:03 .DS_Store\n 0: user:_spotlight inherited allow read,execute,readextattr\n 1: group:com.apple.sharepoint.group.3 inherited allow read,write,execute,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity\n 2: user:UserA inherited allow read,write,execute,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity\n 3: user:Shared-Folder2 inherited allow read,write,execute,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity\nMini-Server:Raid Storage Admin-User$\n\n\nA: You probably made a mistake and got the permutations wrong.\nAfter creating a new share use the defaults and set the standard POSIX permissions for the group and everyone to \"No Access\".

You can also create a new file containing all the pdfs in the page by using \"Export as PDF\".\n\nA: If you have multiple PDF files that you want to open in ONE window as ONE file that you can scroll down you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open ONLY ONE pdf file in previev.\n\n*Use Alt+Cmd+2 (it will open miniatures on the left side).\n\n*Select all OTHER pdf files and drag them manually into miniatures sidebar. \nNow you have old view in which you can move pages up or down, delete them, add other files, save all as one pdf etc. \n\nA: You can open multiple PDFs in the same window, but the UI is different. Multiple PDFs will now open in separate tabs rather than the old way of segmenting them by scrolling.\nHere is a link to the Apple support site if the following steps are not clear: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206998\nTo ensure all documents open in tabs follow these steps:\nBig Sur\n(Open) System Preferences > (Select) General > (Go down to 5th option) Prefer tabs: > (Select from option menu^) Always\nOlder versions of macOS\n(Open) System Preferences > (Select) Dock > (Go down to 5th option) Prefer open tabs when opening documents: > (Select from option menu^) Always\nNow, when you open multiple PDFs they will open within the same window, segmented by different tabs.\n^From the option menu, you have the following options:\n\nAlways: When you open another window in your app, it automatically opens as a tab in your current window.\nIn Full Screen Only: When you open another window in your app, it opens as a tab only if you're using the app in full screen. Otherwise, it opens as a new window.\nManually: Manually choose when to use tabs, whether or not you're using the app in full screen.\n\n\nA: Not exactly a solution to the problem, but fwiw the work-around I am using is to open a document, show thumbnails, then drag other documents into the thumbnail area in the window. (From the last suggestion here: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22421?locale=en_US.)\nFrom reading around I gather this is a change for the Preview prefs in High Sierra (or earlier) and the \"multiple\" options are not accessible through the Preview UI in this release.\n\nA: You can combine pdf pages into one preview document by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open one of the docs.  \n\n*View the thumbnail sidebar. \n\n*Select where you wish to add additional pdf file. (in the thumbnail sidebar)\n\n*Select \"Edit\" from menu then \"Insert\" and \"Page from File\" \n\n*Click on the file you wish to add.\n\n*Save the resulting pdf file that you have added pages to.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: OP here, I found a more technical work around to this. I'm going to assume the user already knows a bit of how to extract files from packages and use the Terminal. \nIf you don't : @frhd's answer is probably easier than trying to learn the basics.\nHere it goes:\nThere is a py file included in mac OS that joins PDF files:\n/System/Library/Automator/Combine\\ PDF\\ Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py\n\nExtract the python file, so its more convenient:\n\"cd\" to the directory of ONLY THE PDF files you want to combine.\nrun the python file as so:\n./join.py -o OUTPUT.pdf *pdf\n\nAnd let it finish, then you will see an OUTPUT.pdf containing all the input PDFs, in the same directory.\n**Note, the ordering you get is probably going to be the same as the \"ls\" ordering, so if you care about order, you have to either modify join.py, or rename the input files.\nAnyways, the OUTPUT.pdf is essentially multiple pdfs in one.\n\nA: Another approach is to concatenate the files by dragging and dropping to PDF Toolkit + app.\nThere are of course other tools on the market like PDFSam and such...\n", "Q: How can I get the LED on an iPhone 6 to blink constantly?

I searched for apps to do this simple thing, but I came up empty. Surely there's a way to get the phone's LED to constantly blink, right?\n\nA: I'm not sure what search criteria you're using, but there are countless flashlight/torch apps that offer this function.

But inside the sudoers file, there is something called the wheel and it says:\n\nroot and user in group wheel can run anything on any machine as any user. \n\nAnd it has %admin ALL = (ALL) ALL below it. Does group wheel take the place of the sudo group? If not, where is the sudo group?\n\nA: The group admin is synonymous with the group sudo found on Linux boxes. Members of the group wheel have a special privilege where they can su (switch user) to root assuming that the member knows root's password. Since the root account is disabled, membership in the group wheel would be similar to membership in the group admin, if configured in /private/etc/sudoers. Since some Apple supplied command line tools require admin membership, the group wheel is a vestige from FreeBSD.\n", "Q: Import HEVC video from iPhone 7 to Final Cut Pro The video format in iPhone 7, new iOS 11, changed to HEVC and will not show up in Final Cut Pro browser.

You'll notice, for example, that under the heading USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter it states:\n\nThe USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter allows you to simultaneously:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Charge your Mac.\n  \n*Connect to other standard USB (USB-A) devices or hubs.\n  \n*Connect your Mac to external HDMI video devices such as a TV, projector, or display.\n  \n\nNOTE: Bold emphasis mine.\nNow, as I mentioned previously, a lot gets down to what is supported by the individual cable, adapter, etc. For example, even about its USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter, Apple says that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The USB-A port on the adapter supports data transfer at up to 5 Gbps (USB 3.1 Gen 1) and can be used to connect standard USB devices or hubs.\n\n*The USB-C port on the adapter charges your computer, but it doesn't transfer data.\n\n\nNote how the USB-A port on this adapter only supports speeds of up to 5 Gbps, while the MBP supports USB speeds up to 10 Gbps. Also note how USB-C port on this particular adapter is limited to only charging. However, the USB-C port on the MBP is not limited in this way, because the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter connects to it and then provides simultaneous functionality to all three of its ports for charging, USB-A devices and HDMI devices.\nNow, depending on your specific model of MacBook Pro (you don't specify), the data transfer speeds may vary depending on the port used. More specifically:\n\nThunderbolt 3 data speeds per MacBook Pro port\nMacBook Pro models introduced in 2016 vary slightly in the data speeds\n  they provide to each Thunderbolt 3 port:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) delivers full Thunderbolt 3 performance on all four ports.\n  \n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) supports Thunderbolt 3 at full performance using the two left-hand ports. The\n  two right-hand ports deliver Thunderbolt 3 functionality, but have\n  reduced PCI Express bandwidth.\n  Always plug higher-performance devices into the left-hand ports on MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) for maximum data\n  throughput.\n  \n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports) delivers full Thunderbolt 3 performance on both ports.\n  \n  \n  About USB speed\nFor USB devices, all 2016 MacBook Pro models deliver USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10\n  Gbps) performance on all Thunderbolt 3 ports.\nUse a USB-C to USB adapter to connect a USB-A device or cable to a\n  Thunderbolt 3 port on your MacBook Pro. Use a USB 3.1 (USB-C to USB-C)\n  cable to connect a USB-C device.\n\nSource: Connect with Thunderbolt 3 on your new MacBook Pro\n", "Q: How can I use software that is not \"safe\"?

If you select some text in an app (e.g. Safari, Chrome or any other app which allows dragging text), and drag the selection to a Finder panel, then a file will be created in the panel with an invisible .textClipping extension. The extension might or might not be visible in Finder depending on your settings.\nOriginally I assumed that the file is plain text, and tried renaming it to add a .txt extension, yet double-clicking still opens it with Finder.\nThen I checked the file type:\nfile 'some text.textClipping'\n>> some text.textClipping: Apple binary property list\n\ncat-ing it shows a header of bplist00?XUTI-Data? followed by readable text.\nI tried:\nmv 'some text.textClipping' 'some text.txt'\n\nbut even after this it still opens with Finder and not the associated app for the .txt files.\nAnother 'oddity' is that dragging a .textClipping file into the terminal — which I sometimes use as a way of inserting the full path — has the unexpected effect of inserting the contents of the file rather than its path.\nI wish I could use .textClipping files to quickly create snippets from web pages and other apps, but for obvious reasons, I want to avoid the snippets being stored in some Apple proprietary binary format.\nIs there a way to convert the snippets to a portable format, such as plain text? How come that this type of files behave differently from others? Is there is some extended file property? Then how to remove it so that the files stop being 'special'?\n\nA: Futher googling about Apple's binary property lists lead me to try plutil  -convert xml1 note.textClipping which produces an XML file with the readable text of the snippet as UTF-8 text, then base64-encoded versions of the same text in UTF-16, mac-plain, and HTML.\nEven after converting the binary to XML format, Finder still opens the file in its own viewer no matter what extension is set (e.g. .plist or .xml).\nRunning /bin/ls -al in the folder shows a @ next to the file name which indicates the file has extended attributes so it looks that they are causing the 'special' behavour in Finder.\nThis answer lead me to try \nxattr -l note.plist \n\nwhich reveals that some of the note's content is stored as an extended attribute key.\nAnd finally, clearing all extended attributes turned the file into a 'normal' file, so now it opens with the associated app:\nxattr -c note.plist \n\nThe command above is for a single file, to strip extended attributes for all files in the current folder run:\nxattr -rc .\n\n\nExtended attributes might be useful in some cases — for example, if you downloaded a file with safari or chrome the original URL will be stored as an extended attribute which you can see with xattr -l myfile.zip or right-clicking a file in Finder and selecting Get Info > The URL will be displayed under More Info > Where from. (Another reason not to use wget when you want to keep track of the file's origin.)\n\n\nA: A python3 snippet that can be added as a Quick Action in Finder with the help of the ootb Automator.app (New > Quick Action > find and drag Run Shell Script onto the right work panel).\nimport plistlib\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nclippath = Path(sys.argv[1])\n\nwith clippath.open('rb') as fi:\n    plist = plistlib.load(fi)\n    data = plist.get('UTI-Data')\n    utf8text = data.get('public.utf8-plain-text')\n    html = data.get('public.html')\n\n    utf8text and clippath.with_suffix(\".txt\").write_text(utf8text, encoding='utf-8')\n    html and clippath.with_suffix(\".html\").write_bytes(html)\n\nThis is how the snippet must look in automator (assuming you have python3 installed in /usr/local/bin/python3):\n\nClicking Save in automator will ask for a name (e.g. Convert Clipping). Once saved, right-click a .textClipping file in Finder, then in the dropdown menu select Quick Actions > Convert Clipping.

When I open it, this .dmg file looks like what I would call a \"virtual disk\" (hence its name I presume) and is listed in  Finder under devices. It is also listed in Disk Utility under Disk Images and it seems like it can be erased or unmounted just like any other disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the logic for which software needs to be installed with such a \"virtual disk\"?\n\n*Why doesn't it come as a simple binary file or I don't know what?\n\n\nA: DMGs have a few key features which make them superior to plain old zips\n\n\n*\n\n*They’re a full file system (meaning they can store file permissions, have custom folder backgrounds, etc)\n\n*They support “mandatory” EULAs before mounting which is nice for legal stuff\n\n*Provide a more reliable execution environment. If you have to do absolute path stuff for installation (which tbh you shouldn’t) you can prepare the DMG, mark it as read-only and use that to install\n\n\nReally the key feature is that they support the full HFS+ filesystem. Zip (commonly, Linux versions sometimes support permissions) is stupid and only supports bundling files and folders and nothing else. No metadata, just the files. \n\nA: Mac software can be delivered as as a .app application bundle (essentially a folder containing all the program resources) or as a .pkg installer which is a program that installs applications in a similar way to Windows.\nOnly command line tools are available as plain binaries which would then be copied to somewhere in the user's PATH such as /usr/local/bin.\nThese can be packaged in an OS X/macOS disk image (.dmg) or a traditional archive format such as .zip or .tar.\n\n\nWhat is the logic for which software needs to be installed with such a \"virtual disk\"?\n\nThis is largely up to the developer. A .dmg is just a virtual hard drive not an installer. The choice to utilise a .dmg is about packaging rather than installation.\nIf an application is a simple .app bundle it is self contained and can be run by double clicking it. It is commonly copied to /Applications for convenience.\nIn addition to encryption and EULAs on opening, the benefit of a .dmg over an archive type is branding. .dmgs can be given custom icons, custom background images and the layout of the contents can be fixed. .dmgs are commonly also read only so the contents will remain exactly as the developer intended it.\nThey also force the user to select where they would like an application; when you unzip an archive the contents will typically be extracted to wherever the archive was located. In contrast, .dmgs will mount in the filesystem and then the .app bundle must be explicitly copied.\n\n\nWhy doesn't it come as a simple binary file or I don't know what?\n\nA Mac application is more than just a binary. In addition to the the binary (located at <appname>.app/Contents/MacOS/) an .app includes a number of resources in <appname>.app/Contents/Resources/. These resources include icons, graphics and localisation files such as en.lproj.\n\nA: \nIs there any other usage for .dmg files other than Software\n  installation?\n\nAnother useful feature about DMGs (since you asked about other uses) is the ability to create an encrypted storage space and store files in that protected space. Useful if you want to protect some files, but not encrypt your entire main hard disk.\nSee Disk Utility for macOS Sierra: Create a disk image using Disk Utility for more info on creating encrypted .dmg files.\n", "Q: Can I use ssh in \"forwarding mode\" as a workaround missing Telnet in High Sierra? If you haven't noticed, telnet is gone from MacOS high Sierra. \nI'm experimenting with ways to use built in MacOS utilities to function as a basic TCP-based VT100 emulator... an ASCII console that's dumb as bricks.\nI have tried SSH in \"forwarding mode\", but unsure of the syntax of source and remote port/socket\n\nssh -L 192.168.1.162:30000\n\nSSH without encryption\n\nnothing yet, but experimenting with cipher=null and other settings...\n\nQuestion\nIs there any way to make SSH act like Telnet?  In port forwarding or other modes?  \n\nA: Well, using built in utilities the answer would be nc. nc is easy to use for this, a simple nc <hostname> 23 does the job. Obviously, if your telnet host is using a non-standard port then replace 23 with the port number. <hostname> can be either the name or IP address.\nnc is the BSD version of the Gnu/Linux netcat utility. If you want the Gnu version it is available via homebrew, brew install netcat. If you're going to that much trouble you may as well install telnet from Sierra on your High Sierra Mac via homebrew, brew install telnet. Note that you should never run brew via sudo.\n", "Q: Unable to install entrprise app through iTunes in windows machine As per apple new update in iTunes app install via iTunes option is removed and if you want to install app you need to use Apple Configurator 2 to install app through system. \nBut Above Tool is for MAC user only what about Windows user how can i distribute my app to windows users?\nAny Idea how to install iPA file through windows machine ?\n\nNote : Due to security reason my company not allowed to use any third\n  party site like Diawi.\n\nHelp me to find out way to install my app through windows machine.\nThanks in Advance!\n\nA: Apple have very quietly released iTunes 12.6.3 - compatible with iOS 11 & still containing the App Store.  \nApple KB: Deploy apps in a business environment with iTunes\nYou need the direct link, it apparently does not appear as an update.\nMac link.\nWindows 32 bit link.\nWindows 64-bit Link.\nIf you've already been using 12.7 you may have luck importing your 12.7 lib  to a clean 12.6.3 Library, as outlined on MacRumors, but I had no joy.  \nI ended up restoring a backup of my Library [just the catalog not all the tunes] from a time before i updated to 12.7.\n", "Q: Why the mail app takes a lot of space although there is no mails? \nSimply look at this. Mail consumes 2.5 GB. Why? I removed all messages, readded gmail account. Anything else?\niOS 10.3.3, iPhone 5, 16GB\n\nA: The Apple Mail app likes to keep cache and data from your emails available offline. That is very helpful for viewing emails and their digital content when you dont have a strong signal, or have access to wifi. \nThere are some solutions that can help you out though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the mail account off of the iPhone. Then restart the iPhone and then re-add that email back to the iPhone.\n\n*Use the Gmail app for iPhone. The gmail app will keep the email size much lower than whats on your iPhone. The most I've seen the gmail app do for me is 400MB. Thats definitely a huge saving in contrast to 2.5GB.\n\n*Limit the amount of email that Gmail can allow the Apple Mail app to have access to. You will have to use the desktop to access this setting in gmail. You can log onto gmail.com, open the Settings page, click “Forwarding and POP/IMAP,” and activate the “Limit IMAP folders to contain no more than this many messages” option. Set it to lets say “1000” and the Mail app won’t be able to download more than the 1000 emails from your account. If you use multiple folders, then that 1000 emails applies to each folder.\nThese three should give you some options to test out and free up some of your storage that the Mail app is eating up.\n", "Q: How do I give a CGI script permission to access Calendar? When I run my script from the command line I can use - am actually prompted to use -  System Preferences to add ssh-keygen-wrapper to be authorised to access the Calendar.\nBut when I run the script as a CGI program it is not authorised to access the Calendar - it is running as nobody and fails - and I don't know how to give the CGI-invoked script required permission.\nA related question is even whether I should as giving nobody access to Calendar ... but that's a separate issue. \n[FYI]\nmacOS High Sierra\nPython CGI script using an AppleScript to read Calendar events\n\nA: The nobody user is non-interactive and doesn’t have calendars anyways. You will need to have some component (maybe another custom app/process) running as you to deliver the calendar info. \nYou really have two options, one of which is very bad.\nFirstly, you could have your CGI scripts run as you. This isn’t hard but super dangerous and not recommended.\nSecondly, you can build what is essentially a calendar proxy. This could be another program (running as you) which ever five minutes reads the calendar data and writes it out to a file which nobody, the account, can read. You already seem to be familiar and working just fine with calendars so this shouldn’t be an issue, it’s just another script that you schedule with cron.\nAnother thing, though I’m really not sure if it will work for nobody, is that you can run sudo su nobody and then launch it. Since OSX knows that the PTTY is attached to your user session it will show the prompt there for you to accept. While you still won’t be able to access your users calendars, this trick is useful if you have to use these sorts of permissions as root whom also doesn’t a graphical session. \n\nA: Of course @Sirens points out the obvious flaw in my approach. I had used the AppleScript as an easy way to access the Calendars available at the command line of the user I was logged in as but, of course, were not available to nobody. \nI gratefully considered @Siren's answer and agreed with him that my approach was basically unsound and a workaround was either too dangerous or ungainly to consider pursuing further.\nI hope this constitutes an answer - useful to anyone who also took this wrong turning - since it seems obvious to pursue a better informed tack using available Python libraries to build a CGI script where I (and nobody) can explicitly provide the Calendar with client credentials independently of the user or machine running the script.\nI have used caldav as a proof of concept but found a few issues in doing so, so am now looking at Apple's CalDAVClientLibrary which looks to be a bit more comprehensive.\n", "Q: Replace USB port on logic board Mac mini late 2012 The USB ports stopped working.

I believe that the answer to this question is \"yes you can but you should not.\"  Explanation is below.  \n\nA: This is a repost of this article I wrote here:  https://discussions.apple.com/message/32385656#32385656\nWith High Sierra, there is a serious thing people should know about that Apple does not mention.  In my opinion, you should avoid APFS on external drives.\nYou cannot make a disk image of an external APFS drive.  Period.  No tool can.  This makes backups of such drives problematic.\nSolution:  use Mac OS Extended instead of APFS on external hard drives, until Apple fixes this limitation.\nAfter converting my external SSD drive to APFS I found that it was having errors and wished to reformat it and restore.  I've been using Time Machine regularly and my first hope was to somehow restore from there.  However, that was not possible because once you reformat a drive, you cannot restore to it from Time Machine.  Time Machine will see it as a new volume.  Time Machine is intended for restoring particular folders and files back to a functioning drive and does not help you if your drive completely fails!  I learned a lesson there.\nLuckily my drive was not in terrible shape, and I also have another drive so I decided to make a backup image and then just restore from that. That's when things got weird.\nI went to SuperDuper! which is my backup image creation tool of choice I've had for years.  It refused to list the APFS drive as a source for backup.  Huh.  You can see in this screen shot that although I have an APFS drive, SuperDuper! just doesn't list it as a source for backups.\n\nOK, so I then turned to Disk Utility.  It greys out the \"Image from...\"  for APFS disks as you can see here:\n\nCarbon Copy Cloner will let you make a backup from APFS to another drive, but will not create an image of it.  If you do, you will get an error when trying to mount the image during the backup process.  So you have to use the whole target drive as a backup.  I usually use disk images so I can have backups of both my internal and external on one external drive.\nSo there you go.  Personal opinion:  I believe the best plan is to not use APFS anywhere you don't have to.  I have not seen any improvement with APFS anyhow -- the \"fast copy\" feature of course only works if you are duplicating a large file on an APFS drive, which is something few people really do often.\nHope this information is helpful to someone.\n(note:  Some might notice and be confused that I'm using a drive called \"2 TB backup encrypted HD APFS\" as my backup source.  I'm writing this after converting my other drive to Mac OS Extended, so for screen shots, I used my backup drive as an example.  The point still holds.  If you don't understand this note, feel free to just ignore it.)\n\nA: Yes, you can. I just connected a 1 TB SSD to my older 2010 iMac running High Sierra. I cloned my internal drive using Carbon Copy Cloner onto my new external SSD. I now use my external drive as my startup disk.  So far everything has been fine. My internal drive was failing so I use the new external drive as my main drive.\nAccording to Rich's fine answer, there are some problems doing this if the drive is formatted as APFS. Well, my external drive is formatted as APFS so I'll see if I experience the same problems.\n", "Q: How to never \"allow this device to access photos and videos\"? I have an iPhone at work, and I charge it by connecting it to my work laptop (Windows 7) via USB.

See screenshot: \n\n\nA: You don't specify, but I'm guessing you're using a Windows laptop. It's actually an issue on the Windows side of things, because what you're getting the wrong message. That is, if you're supposed to get any message, it should be the Trust this computer message.\nThe way to fix this (assuming you are in fact on Windows), is to:\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Start menu and open Control Panel\n\n\n*Click on device manager\n\n\n*You should see a list of device types with arrows to the left of their names\n\n\n*Find the one with iPhone listed under it (usually it'll be under the Portable Devices category, but not always)\n\n\n*Right-click on iPhone and select Update Driver Software...\n\n\n*Click browse and navigate to the following location:\nC:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Apple\\Mobile Device Support\\Drivers\n\n\n*Select it and it should load the driver\nNOTES:\n\n*\n\n*I've tried giving you generic instructions as it's not clear what version of Windows you're using.\n\n*You should have your iPhone connected in order for Windows to see the device.\n\n*Note that you may get the Trust this computer message on your iPhone, but once you opt to trust it then you should be fine to go.\n\n", "Q: Best practice on creating a launcher/updater for a bigger app on MacOS? We have 2 applications: a small launcher/updater, somewhat like the Steam client, and a bigger app which is started from the launcher.\nRight now the launcher downloads the big app inside its own Contents and starts it from there.\nThe launcher/updater and bigger app cannot be merged into a single app as per design requirements.\nThe problem which we're facing is that in some cases we need to overwrite the launcher completely and when we do this the bigger app inside it gets removed. \nWe want to avoid removing the bigger app when we're overwriting.\nWe're considering a few solutions but are unsure which approach is the best:\n1) Create a directory in /Applications, so that we have /Applications/MyApp/Launcher.app and /Applications/MyApp/BiggerApp.app\n2) Install the big app in the Library dir so that we have /Applications/Launcher.app and /Library/MyApp/BiggerApp.app\nApproach 1 has the advantage that all the files are in a single location so if a user wants to remove the app he can just delete that directory.\nApproach 2 has the advantage of not creating a directory for our app inside /Applications but the downside is that if a user wants to uninstall he'll have to remove the dir from /Library as well.\nWhat is the recommended way of storing 2 interdependent but separate apps?\n\nA: *\n\n*Best practice is to include the app in the package contents of the launcher.\n\n*As you said this can't be done, the second best solution would be to create a folder in /Applications.

It may be worth resetting this.\nTo reset the NVRAM on all Late-2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your MBP reboot normally.\n\n\nNote 1: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nNote 2: If your Mac is using a firmware password, you will need to disable the firmware password before resetting NVRAM.\n", "Q: In which case I would lose my OS X license? I'm planning to install Arch linux on my Macbook Air (mid-2015), and installing means I'm going to mess with the partitions on the disk, and lots of stuff, and I'm not expert on these topics, so there is a chance that I might delete something important for OS X on the other partition, or about recovery partition etc.\nSo my question is in which cases I would lose my OS X license?

Once you know you have a backup, then the risk is limited to potentially wasting a lot of time reinstalling macOS if things go wrong and then migrating your data across from your backup.\nIf you do need to reinstall macOS, then you have three options you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*commandR to reinstall the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version \n\n*optioncommandR to upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac\n\n*shiftoptioncommandR to reinstall the macOS that came with your Mac, or the version closest to it that is still available\n\n\nBut remember - you must have a backup regime in place!\n", "Q: Does using a third party(non-Apple) MagSafe 45W power adaptor cause power problems with MacBookAir I had to replace my power adaptor of 2010 version MacBookAir with a third party power adaptor (because it was cheaper) a few months down the line I am having to force wake up my MacBookAir and worried that the third party adaptor may be slowly damaging internal power circuitary. Am I right to be worried?\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: Yes, you should be worried. Power adapters which have not been Apple certified can be shoddily constructed, have inferior components, and frequently lack safety mechanisms that prevent harm to your device and yourself. This article at Macworld about iPhone chargers shows some of the problems. This forum thread at MacRumors discusses MacBook chargers specifically.\nYou may save a few dollars getting a non-Apple branded charger, but if it damages your machine, you may just end up spending much more money in the end.\n", "Q: Bought an iPad but it's supervised.Is there a way to remove it? I bought an iPad Air 2 from a third party and I see it's supervised.It has many restrictions.There is no delete button in Settings.The iPad is iCloud free.I tried restoring it in recovery mode, restore and update in iTunes and then Set up as new, erase all data from the iPad but the configuration won't be removed.When it's being set up it says \"retrieving configuration\".I tried iActivate win but it says that it's not in their servers.\nFrom what I've read, if the configuration persists then it's in DEP.Can it be removed from DEP somehow?\nIs there a WAY to make this iPad  a normal one so I can use it? \n\nA: Supervised devices lock in management, so your only recourse is to wipe the device. At that point you may discover that it’s also an enrolled device (DEP) and wiping does not unenroll from DEP as that is different than a MDM profile. \nYou cannot, by yourself, remove the iPad from DEP. The iPad has all these restrictions because it was previously managed by a company or school. You’ll need to figure out which school or company it is and send their IT and email and hope that they will remove it from their program for you. Their and IT and only their IT can unenroll an iPad from DEP.\nYou likely have bought an iPad that a student/teacher/employee/malicious actor stole. I doubt that an IT department knowledgeable enough to use DEP wouldn’t know to disown the devices before resale.\nAlso, I know this question will likely attract a lot of attention by students wishing to remove their devices from DEP: short answer, you can’t. Long answer: if you jailbreak the device you can remove the profile. This change will persist while you are on that iOS version and maybe once you update however if you restore the device it’ll come back. I of course don’t recommend this and you’ll violate your school policy (and IT will know, it’s not hard to detect a jailbroken device). \n\nA: For the record, I just put my iPad in recovery mode and reloaded it without issue. We have several 12\" iPads Model a1670. We use them in a museum and tried using single-app mode to prevent patrons from messing with them. However the management macbook became corrupted and we could no longer make changes to them. We found that guided access offers more flexibility. \nBottom line, using iPad recovery mode with iTunes worked perfectly.\n", "Q: Save Bash shell history also when closing Terminal tab When a macOS High Sierra Terminal shell is ended using the exit command the Bash shell history is saved and can be recalled in subsequent shell sessions. However, if the shell is ended by closing the Terminal tab or window, the shell history will not be saved. How can the shell history also be saved when closing a Terminal tab?\nPresumably the problem relates to the fact that the trap set in /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal (trap shell_session_update EXIT) is not triggered when closing a tab.  Is there a signal that could be trapped when closing a Terminal tab?\n\nA: This drove me crazy for months until I read through /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal. trap shell_session_update HUP fixed it for me. Terminal appears to send SIGHUP to the shell whenever a tab is closed or the entire Terminal app is closed via Cmd-Q.\n", "Q: Is it possible to identify what the parent program/app is from a running process? I'm able to find processes using top or ps. That's no problem.\nSometimes I find that some processes are taking up a lot of memory or cpu and I'm trying to identify what the root program is.\nFor instance, the process sort sometimes just ends up taking 2-3 gigs of memory over like 4 hours. I'd like to know what program initiated the sort process so I can try and fix it.\n\nA: ps has an option to access the PPID/parent PID of a process:\n$ ps aux -o ppid\nUSER               PID  %CPU %MEM      VSZ    RSS   TT  STAT STARTED      TIME COMMAND           PPID\nadmin            65694  10.9  0.1  4385132  13340   ??

I have a pair of the same model and size monitors at home, as I have in the office. They're all named \"Company Model (1)\" and \"Company Model (2)\". \nIt seems like the setup I have at home has them physically arranged from L -> R: 1 -> 2, but in the office, however, it's 2 -> 1.\nThe result is when I work from home, or work from the office, I need to constantly set the Display Arrangement in Preferences. \nIs there a way to delete the displays, so I can reintroduce them to the computer in the right order, or just rename them so the one physically on the left is always 1, and the one on the right is always 2?\n\nA: It turns out it's the dongle with which the monitors are connected. I have two different brands (Satechi and Anker) at home, and (Apple and Anker) at work. When I plug the monitors into the different dongles, it changes orientation. The reason the physical swap didn't work, was because I also unplugged the cables from the monitors in the office, and reconnected them to the different dongles. I tried unplugging the monitors from the dongles at home and swapping them, and and they indeed switched.\nThis is probably the most trivial of information, but it's at least answered!\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra memory always at 75% Since my update to macOS High Sierra my memory is always at 75% even after a fresh startup.\nIs it just iStat Menus that shows it this way or is there really only 25% of memory free (out of 8GB) ?\nOr is it the memory that is saved for applications ?\nWhat is the difference between:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wired (???)\n\n*Active (currently in use?)\n\n*Compressed (not used since longe time?)\n\n*Free (free...)\n\n\nAfter closing every app I could, here is the result, approximately 50% of RAM. But WindowServer is huge... What is it?\n\n\nA: MacOS will try to use as much memory as it can. Having more RAM will improve performance, but using most of what you have is not in itself a bad thing. MacOS will make room, if it needs to.\nThis Apple support document tells you what the various attributes mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wired Memory: Memory that can’t be compressed or paged out to your\nstartup drive, so it must stay in RAM. The wired memory used by a\nprocess can’t be borrowed by other processes. \n\n*Compressed: The amount of memory in RAM that is compressed to make\nmore RAM memory available to other processes. Look in the Compressed \nMem column to see the amount of memory compressed for each process.\n\"Active\" is not a term that Apple uses anymore, but it's 'general' memory used by applications. Wired tends to be system memory, which can't be removed because it's critical; and compressed tends to be stuff that's not being used right now, and so can be compressed to save space.\nMemory management is: a) more complicated than \"water filling a bottle\"; b) something the OS is good at, c) something the OS is doing constantly. \n\nA: Use Activity Monitor instead of the silly tool iStatMenus.\nThe Ram handling is complxer than that.\n", "Q: Why DND automatically turns itself on and off in macOS High Sierra? I am noticing for quite a few days that after upgrading to high sierra though DND doesn't has any custom timeline for auto on and off in system preferences it automatically turns itself on every-day at 12:00 am and turns itself off at 12:00 pm, I don't know why is this happening\n\n\n\nA: DND acts buggy in High Sierra when you set the time to midnight. I'm not sure if this applies to you but DND does not like 12:00 AM. Use any time except 12:00 AM such as 12:01 AM or 11:59 PM if you are setting DND time values. \nIf you set DND to turn on at 12:00 AM and off at any other time, it will show as disabled the next time you look at it and the start/end times will have been changed to 10:00 PM/7:00 AM.\nI spoke with Apple and they confirmed this behavior in High Sierra.\n", "Q: How to completely block specific Wi-Fi SSID on macOS? I'm looking for a way to totally blacklist a Wi-Fi network (by SSID) in macOS. \nAnd no, I promise you that I really (truly!) do not need to just have the computer \"forget it\" by removing it from the network list. I need to completely and  totally prevent the computer from connecting to a certain network entirely. \nIt's super, crazy easy on Windows. Is there any way to do this on a Mac?\n\nA: There's no blacklist function (that I know of) but there are a couple of simple workarounds\nRestrict to Admins Only\nYour first option would be to set up networking and restrict it so only Admins can join networks (Network Settings >> WiFi Adapter >> Advanced)\n\nThe caveat here is that the user can no longer be an admin.\nProgmatically remove network\nYour second option is to have a terminal command run periodically:\nnetworksetup -removepreferredwirelessnetwork en1 SSID\n\nIf the SSID doesn't exist, it will just error out without any issues.  If it does exist, it will remove it from the preferred (saved) network.\nYou could put this is a simple bash script\n#!/bin/bash\n\nSSID=MyBannedSSID\n\nnet=$(networksetup -listpreferredwirelessnetworks en1 | grep ${SSID} | cut -f2)\nap=$(networksetup -getairportnetwork en1 | cut -d \":\" -f 2 | cut -c 2-)\n\n# Remove Network if exists in saved networks\nif [ \"$net\" = \"$SSID\" ]\n  then networksetup -removepreferredwirelessnetwork en1 ${SSID}\n  sleep 5\n\nelse echo \"No Network\"\nfi\n\n#Power cycle wireless adapter if connected to banned network\nif [ \"$ap\" = \"$SSID\" ]\n  then  networksetup -setairportpower en1 off\n        networksetup -setairportpower en1 on\nfi\n\nthen use cron or launchd (preferred) to run it periodically.  The caveat is that while they may join the network, it will eventually (per your schedule) delete it.\nYou have to run this as root (meaning put in /Library/LaunchDaemons if using launchd) otherwise it will ask you for a password every time.\nWhat the script is doing\n\n*\n\n*Checks to see if banned SSID is saved\n\n*Removes the saved network if it exists\n\n*Power cycles the airport card if it's attached to the banned SSID\n\n\nA: I've just tested this and it works! \nYou need the app Apple Congifurator 2, it's on the App Store, made by Apple.\nCreate a new profile, in the wifi section create a new payload. Fill out the information, including the correct security type. Set the password to something wrong. Uncheck the 'Auto Join' option. \nNow, why does this work? The profile sets settings which cannot be changed by the user and so if you configure it with a password the user will not be able to uninstall the profile. Since you have configured the wrong password for the profile, the computer won't be able to connect to the network and will show an incorrect password popup. That's where the \"auto join\" setting comes in. By configuring the device to not automatically join that network, the device will only attempt to connect to it when the user selects it out of the menu. Since the user can't change the stored password they won't be given the option to try a new password and so won't be able to connect. With auto join off, you also won't get tons of \"incorrect password\" errors on the device any time the network is in range since it won't bother to connect to it. \n\n\nA: I have no experience but what I would try:\nsetup a new acccount, give it administrator rights,\nlogin in this new account, go to SystemPreferences, ParentalControls:\nin there set parental controls for your main account, set the access to ...aruba... as forbidden.\n", "Q: Screen sharing turned off, but appears as \"enabled\" I used this command to disable screen sharing:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist\n\nBut when I try to confirm if it's disabled using the following, I get \"enabled\"\n[[ -f /etc/com.apple.screensharing.agent.launchd ]] && echo 'enabled' || echo 'disabled'\n\nAm I misunderstanding something? I would like to turn screen sharing off, and confirm that it is off. \n\nA: Your shell script code is simply a check for the presence of the file /etc/com.apple.screensharing.agent.launchd.  If the file is present, it prints enabled, else it prints disabled.\nHowever, this file is always present (in 10.13 and possibly under 10.12 as well) whether the screensharing agent is currently active or not.  Watchfiles in launchd are not necessarily checked for their presence or non-presence (unlike pidfiles in Linux, for example).  Changes and updates to the file can also trigger actions.\nIt's probably best to rely on launchctl's actual facilities for introspection, via sudo launchctl list or the newer launchctl print system commands, rather than checking for the presence of legacy files.\n", "Q: Activity Monitor show no processes With 10.13.

I know there is the sound effects list in Preferences->sound, but this will change only the alert sound - that I like. What is annoying to me is the notifications sound. I like to work with headphones and music, and I wish to be notified when a new message came in by freechat, for example. But the sound is loud and annoying, maybe another sound or just lower volume...\nI have looked and it seams there is no way by the easy way, the Preferences->notifications panel only allow me to decide if I wish the sound or not, there is no other option. But this sound must be in a file somewhere, maybe there is some definitions in other file...\nAny ideas?\n\nA: That would be a workaround, but it'll prevent from hearing notifications through your headphones. You'll hear them e.g. on your Mac speakers instead\n\n*\n\n*Connect your headphones to your Mac\n\n*Open Audio MIDI Setup app (you'll find it under Utilities folder)\n\n*Select any output audio device, apart from your headphones\n\n*Right click and select Play Alerts and Sound Effects Through This Device like in the image below:\n\n\nI hope this helps :)\n", "Q: Multitasking bar does not show up on my iPhone The following page indicates what the multitasking bar should look like after pressing home twice:\nhttps://gigaom.com/2011/02/21/ios-101-how-to-use-multitasking-on-your-iphone-or-ipad/\n\nHowever when I press home twice instead the running apps are shown in the deck of cards - and nothing is shown at the bottom of the screen.\nThis is on an iPhone 5c with iOS 10.3.3.

The cards are previews of the apps represented by the icons in the picture you provided. It is not possible to achieve the picture in modern iOS without jailbreaking.\n", "Q: Negative affects from leaving iPhone plugged in at 100%? I usually plug in my phone at night when I go to bed but it’s almost always at around 70-80% so am I damaging my phone (iPhone 6S) from having it plugged in at 100% for a few hours every night? \n\nA: Questions about batteries and charging often risk inviting a lot of opinion, so to try and keep this to the facts, you should read what Apple has to say about their batteries. \nHowever, leaving your iPhone plugged into an AC source overnight causes no problems whatsoever. In fact, this is what millions of users do each night. \nThe only time you need to be concerned about storing an iPhone at 100% is if you're going to be storing it long-term. On storing devices long-term Apple says:\n\nDo not fully charge or fully discharge your device’s battery — charge\n  it to around 50%. If you store a device when its battery is fully\n  discharged, the battery could fall into a deep discharge state, which\n  renders it incapable of holding a charge. Conversely, if you store it\n  fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may lose\n  some capacity, leading to shorter battery life.\n\nSome other key points from Apple are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple lithium-ion batteries use fast charging to reach 80% of their capacity and then switch to slower trickle charging to complete the charge.\n\n*Charge your iPhone whenever you want. Many people believe you need to let them discharge 100% before recharging. This is not true.\n\n*Ambient temperature is one of the biggest factors in battery health/life. iPhones are designed to work at their best when ambient temperatures are between 0° to 35° C (32° to 95° F).\n\n*Store your iPhone where the temperature is between -20º and 45º C (-4º to 113º F). Don’t leave it in your car, because temperatures in parked cars can exceed 45º C (113º F).\n\n", "Q: Getting strange characters in third party apps. How do I fix it?

The ⌘+; (command + semicolon) hides all guides in Adobe Illustrator. The problem is that I'm using a Swiss keyboard layout. The semicolon for me is located on the comma (,) key and I type a semicolon with Shift+, (shift + comma). However, neither ⌘+, (command + comma) nor ⌘+Shift\n+, (command + shift + comma) seems to trigger the actual keyboard shortcut. I am aware that I can change system specific keyboard shortcuts within the keyboard settings of Mac OS but this doesn't work in Illustrator and, unfortunately, there's no keyboard shortcut setting in Illustrator either.\nIs there any general way how I can access a keyboard shortcut if one of the keys is not accessible by a single key press?\n\nA: On an English keyboard, it's the key to the right of L. Sometimes the position is mapped, rather than the actual character. Maybe worth a shot, though I can't test here. \nBTW, Adobe uses its own key-mapper - towards the bottom of the Edit Menu on Photoshop [I don't use Illustrator] - so you could check &/or change it in there...\n\n", "Q: Use a Mac mini as a remote build server for an iOS game Five other people and I are developing an iOS game using ARKit. I have a MacBook that I use for myself, and a Mac mini sitting at home that could act as a remote build server.\nNow, it would be easy enough for them to edit the project's swift files, upload them to my machine, and have it build the project for them. Or even just push them to out git repository which runs all the tests with TravisCI.\nI feel that's a really subpar solution, as you'd miss all of the helpful features of a modern IDE. It's a lot easier when your tools immediately tell you you're doing something stupid, rather than writing a bunch of code just to have it not compile in the end.\nI started searching, and I found this: http://dringend.cc\nSomething like that would probably be ideal, but unfortunately it's only available for iOS, and they'd need a Windows or Linux application.\nThings I've thought about using:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Steam or something to stream the entire desktop (VNC is too slow) so they could use Xcode. Could work, but it could be flaky depending on the Internet connection. Plus, it doesn't support multiple users obviously, and even if it did, it would still be a pain to manage multiple git users.\n\n*Something like https://www.macincloud.com for each of them, but it could get expensive. Ideally we wouldn't have to spend any money.\n\n*Buying Macs - not an option.\n\n\nIs there any sort of IDE that would give you code analysis, and allow you to run code remotely and see the output locally? I know CLion supports Swift, but it wouldn't really work when you tried to import UIKit and etc.\n\nI know working around having to get Macs results in a crappy experience overall, but this is something we're doing as part of our university course. We do have some hope of putting it on the App Store (that's why we chose iOS), but it's not a commercial project by any means - and as such there are no funds available to buy Macs.\nI had some hope I could devise an elegant solution for this, but perhaps having them run a slow VM would be our only somewhat acceptable option.\n\nA: I haven't had a chance to test this well designed and documented system that Microsoft just announced, but you might be able to run the free tier or arrange an educational discount if they're looking for some partners as they launch.\n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft Visual Studio App Center for iOS: https://appcenter.ms/iOS\nIf that doesn't work, my recommendation is you’ll need to run Xcode 9 on your mini and then get one used Mac for every other contributor. They can connect to the build server on iOS 9 and either use Xcode themselves or Screen Share as the second account each Mac allows fully supported. \nYou will waste far more effort, suffer low quality code and delay working around tooling issues than you’ll gain by not funding your development team with tools that work. Buy broken Mac at scrap prices and fix them up or cook dinner and trade labor with someone that can repair Macs. Do anything you can think of to get your team Xcode running on macOS. \nIt’s like training dentists remotely with no tools but books and then hoping they perform as part of a team still without tools. Your customers will not be fooled when they see the results. Worse, if your iOS app is going to the App Store, you’re competing against every team that had funding for 4 years college, the best training and tools. \n\nNow, I hope to be proven wrong soon. I think we’re a year or so away from the Xcode server to be good enough to really run as the build server João hopes to find, but in October 2017 they aren’t ready. The iPad should be a $250 solo, design, test, build machine as swift playgrounds mature. Once that is hooked into Xcode in the cloud or running remotely, it should be game on for windows, Linux, iOS and Mac to be on somewhat more equal footing to program for iOS since someone might invest the effort to reverse engineer the remote Xcode programming functions.  Today, Mac is privileged to develop for iOS and to operate otherwise puts your team at a huge disadvantage. \nFor low cost programming options, you might need to scope to python or swift alone without the iOS framworks to keep the budget low for 1:1 hardware deployments that you could fund with a grant or course fees.\n\n\n*\n\n*$30 Raspberry Pi - http://blog.andrewmadsen.com/post/136137396480/swift-on-raspberry-pi\n\n*$9 Adafruit Trinket M0 - https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500\n", "Q: MacBook Pro dead screen with update to High Sierra My MacBook Pro 15” 2012 Retina screen is completely black.

I’m using TextEdit 1.1 on Mac OS El Capitan Version 10.11.6. \n\nA: Credit:https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2242153?tstart=0\nYou can achieve this by opening terminal and typing cd [path of the folder where your journals are located] you should replace [ ] with the the folder where your diary entries are written , just drag and drop the folder into the terminal window.(Remember to hit space after typing cd) Then you can merge all the text edit files into one by typing \ncat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > file4 The file1.txt, file 2.txt and so on will be your diary entries so if you have more just type the name of the file followed by a space and the > symbol will merge all the documents into one file4.txt you can change the name as per your concern.\n\nA: By default, TextEdit creates Rich Text formatted files, e.g. filename.rtf, not Plain Text formatted files, e.g. filename.txt and as such, if the default is in play, then you cannot use cat as suggested in the other answers. This is because cat doesn't understand Rich Text formatting in order to concatenate the files. \nIf the documents are default TextEdit Rich Text formatted, then you'll need to use the textutil command:\ntextutil -cat rtf file1.rtf file2.rtf -output newfile.rtf\n\n\nA: Not from the TextEdit app but you can from the terminal.

(And, to delete the duplicative *.app via Finder)? I use Gvim on Windows platforms on an hourly basis, and it really bothers me that I cannot make MacVim work properly when I need to move around with the MacBook Air. A bunch of things are going wrong on the OS X system:\n\n\n*\n\n*That there are a lot of MacVim.app left overs in my system, as follows. They are all accessible (I can open a file through any one of the following 5)\n\n\n*That the Vim opened through my Terminal is of a different version (Vim 8.0, 1-543).\n\n*Worst still, I got Python compatibility issue across all versions of the MacVim and Vim.

To note,\n\n\n*\n\n*I have solved the Python problem that has to do with R and Python script on my Windows machines. Detailed steps are in the link above.\n\n\n\nQuestions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Can I delete the outdated MacVim.app's from my OS X system?\n\n*How to let the Terminal use the correct version Vim? I may need to build the Vim + MacVim locally?\n\n*Fundamentally, how to address this incompatibility issue? Based on my fix on Windows platforms, the errors are thrown when the \"bit\" version of Vim is not the same as the Python. Moving everything to 64-bit solves the problem even on a Windows machine. However, I don't even see a \"bit\"-version from either Vim builds on my Mac system: be it MacVim or Vim through Terminal.\n\n\nA: First, you can certainly delete all the outdated version of MacVim leaving only the newest.\nTo run MacVim from the command line you need to call the mvim script which is in the app itself, somewhere like /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/bin/mvim. The best way to do this is to use a bash alias in your .bash_profile file, alias mvim='/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/bin/mvim \n", "Q: Photos.app Edit-mode UI broken after upgrading to High Sierra Since upgrading to macos High Sierra, my Photos.app's editing functions have been troublesome. Features such as Retouch simply do not work, and I'm unable to access advanced options, such as the Shadows slider commonly found under the \"Light\" adjustment.\nOSXDaily put out a troubleshooting guide for HS apps today which included a \"Create a new account to test app\" suggestion, which I did.  On the new test account, Photos.app's Edit features work as they're supposed to; Having not seen it work properly before, I did not know what to expect, nor what was missing prior.\nOn my original login, Photos.app's Edit screen doesn't show the pull-down arrows that should be to the left of Options.

I'm not sure what other configuration files could be interfering with the Photos.app editing UI.\nI'm not sure how to proceed without clobbering my current login account.\n\n\n\nA: Earlier today, I discovered that if I clicked where the pull-down arrow was supposed to be, the application behaved as expected, and the additional options dropped down. \nSome kind of bug, I thought.\nIt turns out, I had \"Increase Contrast\" turned on in Accessibility system preferences.  When I toggle this on, the triangle there, but only +2% lighter than the surrounding pixels:  #202020 on an #1C1C1C background, a +2% difference, as reported by Digital Color Meter.app.  When I uncheck that option, the triangles appear, as #3C3C3C  on an #1C1C1C background, a +9% difference.\n", "Q: High Sierra Freezes on Login I have a rMBP (late 2012 model) that I recently installed High Sierra on and enabled FileVault (this has apparently been known to cause some similar issues on older version of OSX, but I found no work around with High Sierra). \nCurrently when I try to log into my standard user on boot up, I get a progress bar that get to ~75% progress and then freezes (I have left it in this state overnight with the hopes that it was just slow - no luck). \nRestarting the computer in recovery mode (cmd+R) causes a similar issue, where the progress bar gets to about 50% and then freezes (again I've let it sit here overnight with no progress), meaning I cant use the disk utility to repair the disk. \nSafe mode (shift on startup) also doesn't do anything - progress bar freezes at ~75% on logging in.\nResetting the PRAM and SMC also don't appear to do anything. \nBooting in single user mode (cmd+S) lets me attempt to repair the disk manually using:\n/sbin/fsck -fy/\n\nBut it repeatedly returns the error: \nwarning: apfs_keylocker.pr_block_count is zero for encrypted fs (0x403)\n** The volume /dev/rdisk1s1 could not be verified completely.\napfs_vfstop_unmount:1405: fake mount <ptr> going away\n\nRunning verbose mode (cmd+V) on startup runs until it reaches: \nen3: promiscuous mode succeeded\nIOConsoleUsers: time(0) 0->0, lin 0,lik 1,\nIOConsoleUsers: gIOLockState 3, hs 0, bs 0, now 0, sm 0x0\nSetting BTCoex Config: enable_2G:1, profile_2g:0, enable_5g:1, profile_5g:0\n\nWhere it locks up and freezes.\nI have also tried reinstalling OSX from a bootable USB drive and via WiFi.

I can't recover it under Apps in iTunes because iTunes 12 got rid of the Apps section.\nI do have a lot of backups from various points over the past year, so the app has to be recoverable somehow.\nI've also got iExplorer, but it only shows me the .app file of the currently connected phone (6s running iOS 11 that doesn't read the app) and I can't find the app file under Browse iTunes Backups.\nAny advice?\n\nA: Downgrade iTunes to 12.6.3 (which will install over 12.7) and use it to download and install the app.\nIf you already had the app downloaded from iTunes or a backup, you can also reinstall apps that are no longer available for download. \n\nA: The .ipa app files are stored on the Mac at ~/iTunes/Music/Mobile Applications.

After making sure that all the photos are in iCloud Photo Library, you don’t delete them from the iPhone. Instead, you disable iCloud Photo Library and let the system remove them (it may take awhile depending on the number of photos and videos).\nNew photos can be added to iPL via your Mac either by manually syncing through Photos or Image Capture, (for photos) using PhotoStream or another 3rd party program like PhotoSync. Or you can re-enable iPL with “optimized” set. I’ve got 14K items (with s few weeks of full-size photos and videos) and I’m only using 1.78GB.\nThat said, I’ve seen some funky issues in the past where the system doesn’t remove some of the items when I disabled iPL. I tried manually deleting them but, when I re-enabled iPL, the deleted items were all deleted from iCL. I got them back from the Recently Deleted album but I had a few minutes of panic until I remembered they should be there.\nI was just trying to force the iPhone to replace the current copies with optimized items to save space. I think doing this is actually to backup and restore your iPhone using an iCloud Backup.\n\nA: Assuming the photos in question have been imported into your Photos library on the Mac, then those files are stored within that library. Removing them from your iPhone will have no impact whatsoever.\nHowever, if you're referring to photos that haven't actually been imported to your Photos library on the MBP, then you may run into problems (depending on how you've got things set up).\nIf you want to be 100% certain, open the Photos app on your MBP and then connect your iPhone to your MBP via USB. You should be prompted to import any photos you haven't already imported. Go through the process until it's finished importing everything.\nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*This may take some time if you haven't done it in a while and/or if you also have a lot of videos (as these are imported as well).\n\n*In case you don't already, you should have a backup regime in place (such as using Time Machine). This is the only way to protect yourself against unexpected data loss.\n\n", "Q: Why do Notes not sync? iCloud Notes not syncing says the solution is to update to El Capitan or log out of iCloud.  But I am now on 10.13 and have had to log in to iCloud many times due to updates and new devices.  All (Macbook Pro 2012 and iPad Pro) are on the latest updates.  (Which is why the other one saying to \"upgrade to El Capitan\" is not helpful.)\nMy iPad prefs said that four IMAP accounts, one Exchange account, and the iCloud should be syncing Notes.  The Macbook Pro prefs say the same.  But Notes I create on the iPad never appear on the Macbook Pro.  (And vice versa.)\nWondering whether having them on more than one account might be a problem, I tried to turn Notes off on the IMAP accounts.  Two accounts did it silently, but the third warned me that it would DELETE Notes from the device.  Since they aren't apparently anywhere else, I declined.\nHow can I get Notes to show up in the Notes app on both devices?  Preferably the most efficient way in terms of storage and bandwidth.\n\nA: Open Notes on your MacBook and in the top menu, select:\nNotes -> Preferences\nYou will see a drop-down selector labelled \"Default Account:\".\nMake sure to select the iCloud account.\nThen, while still on your MacBook, look at the left bar of your \"Notes\" app. You should see your IMAP and iCloud accounts there. If you do not see a left bar, then click the \"sidebar\" icon in the Notes toolbar.\nClick on each of those sections and drag the notes into the iCloud -> Notes section.\nNow, all of your notes should be on your iCloud account.\nThen, on your iPad, go to Settings -> Notes -> Default Account, and set \"iCloud\" as your default account.\nIf this fails, please post a comment with details, and I will try to assist further.\n", "Q: Can viruses travel through pictures I took with my smartphone? I plan on uploading my photos/videos from my iPhone to my computer using a usb cable. I suspect that my iPhone may have a virus because I've been to questionable site on accident. \nIf I upload photos/videos I taken from my iPhone to my computer via usb cable is there a chance a virus can come through the connection? \n\nA: Sure they could, but it's unlikely.\nSpeaking generally - it's statistically almost impossible your iOS device was compromised on the OS level. The most likely price for a vulnerability on iOS 10 or iOS 11 would be 5 to 15 million dollars. That means run of the mill viruses can't afford them and would profit far more selling to governments and spy agencies which generally design and deploy them to never spread so they don't get discovered. \nUnless you work for atomic power / weapons research or intelligence or some very powerful company / people, the odds you have a virus on iOS is low. \nThat being said, if you have sketchy apps, downloaded files or jailbroken devices it's quite possible your files could be compromised with run of the mill PC viruses and much less likely Mac malware and least likely Mac virus.\nThe steps you take to protect your computer could be as simple as enabling GateKeeper, only running signed apps, updating your Mac. If you want windows protection advice - you might ask that on https://superuser.com or from Microsoft.\n\nA: iPhones do not get viruses, and if a virus was written for an iPhone, it would not run on a Mac or PC or any computer.\n", "Q: Bought an iPhone 6 from a friend - iCloud question The phone was wiped but they left their AppleID logged in.

I have a 2015 MacBook Air 128GB with Sierra Recent purchase as new from Apple, still under warranty). A couple of months ago I was looking at the SSD using DiskUtility and saw that the SSD seemed to be a lot more than 128GB, it looked like it was 256GB. 128GB was available to me and the rest was a CoreStorage partition. (Give or take a few GB for the Recovery partition.) So I thought that if I could remove the CS partition, I would have 256GB available to me, not 128GB.\nA couple of manoths later, I finally got time to try it. Much to my surprise, there is no CS partition anymore. HD Utility doesn't show one, so I tried Terminal and still no CS partition, whereas previously there was a CoreStorage partition shown. And the SSD is only 128GB.\nSo where did the CS partition go? \n\nA: It is possible that you misinterpreted what you saw. The diskutil list command in Terminal, for example, would show you both the 128GB physical disk, as well as the 128GB CoreStorage logical volume. These are listed separately, but are in fact the same storage.\nRunning disktuil cs list in Terminal will confirm if you have a CoreStorage volume or not. To my knowledge, it's not likely that a CoreStorage volume would revert itself. One possible cause that I can think of would be a reinstall of macOS.\n", "Q: How to remap \"quit application\" to Command+ESC system wide? As of now it's set to ⌘Q everywhere which is very unintuitive and being next to ⌘W, which I use a lot, it's very annoying too.\n⌘Esc doesn't do anything (on my laptop at least) and I think it makes sense to remap the quit action to it. I think I can do it one by one - one app at a time. But is there a way I can change it for all the apps at once - from one setting, or using some tool?\nAnd I would like ⌘Q to do something else or nothing at all.\n\nA: Well this sure turned out to be a question that seemed simple, but snowballed into a hassle to solve. \nI'm going to kind of start from the beginning:\nTurns out disabling ⌘+Q natively is only possible if you are ok with actually just replacing it with another function. Just outright disabling it is a no go... But, some third party apps can overwrite it. I'll get to that later. Also, as simple of an idea as it seems, you can't set a new shortcut for \"Quit\" through the native keyboard shortcut editor thing, because that relies on the full menu item name and wouldn't you guess it, it's most often: \"Quit {application name}\" so it's impossible to target all apps with that single shortcut.\nThen I thought... Alright, how aboutAutomator Service. I could use an apple script to close applications with that... Well, you can't set the shortcut ⌘+Esc for Automator Services apparently, but you can set that shortcut globally in some third party apps, which is the way I ended up doing it all.\nSolution:\nSo I tried to find the cheapest third party app I have that can do all that we want to happen, enter BetterTouchTool. \nKarabiner should be able to do this for free, but a version that works in Sierra and later is under a rewrite,\n not sure if it currently has the power to do it... \n\n\n*\n\n*In BTT, I made a new global keyboard shortcut ⌘+Q and defined no action for it, essentially disabling it.\n\n*Then I made another shortcut: ⌘+Esc with the predefined action Run Apple Script in background:\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set frontmostApp to name of the first application process whose frontmost is true\nend tell\ntell application frontmostApp to quit\n\nYou should know that this applescript should work in most applications, but not all of them. I'm not aware of a bulletproof way to do it.\nThis shortcut could just be \"Trigger other keyboard shortcut: Cmd+Q\", but since we disabled that shortcut, that is no longer an option.\n\nThat's it. \n", "Q: APFS doesn’t fully support AFP After I upgraded to High Sierra's APFS, afp://ipadress no long show me files on the remote computer’s APFS drive (only spinning drive shows up, and if the remote computer doesn’t have a spinning drive I cannot visit the computer).

I want to be in version 37, which is supported in my operating system.\n\nA: Try the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely uninstall all the versions of Opera from your Mac.\n\n*Reinstall your preferred version of Opera.\n\n*Disconnect from Internet connection.\n\n*Launch and Quit Opera.\n\n*Launch Terminal.\n\n*Type this code and hit enter.\ndefaults write com.operasoftware.Opera OPDisableAutoUpdate true\n\n\n*Reconnect Internet, launch Opera, and select About Opera.\n\n*The screen will display if auto update has been disabled. It should look something like this:\nVersion information\n\nVersion:    49.0.2725.64 - Update checker is disabled\n\nUpdate stream:  Stable\n\nSystem: Mac OS X 10.9.5 64-bit\n\n\nA: Rename the autoupdate binary.\nYou should be able to find it in /Applications/Opera.app/Contents/MacOS\nRename it to anything else:\nmv /Applications/Opera.app/Contents/MacOS/opera_autoupdate /Applications/Opera.app/Contents/MacOS/opera_autoupdate.bak\n\nTechnically speaking, you could delete it, but in my experience, it's always safer to rename (move) it to something else.  This way, if something goes wrong, you can easily revert.\nDisclaimer:  I don't have the older version of Opera so I cannot personally test if it works on v37.x.xxxx.xx\n\nA: For other Opera version, please try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download version you want http://www.opera.com/download/index.dml/?os=mac&list=all \n\n*Turn off Wifi network\n\n*Delete current Opera App, delete 2 folders: ~/Library/Application Support/com.operasoftware.Opera; ~/Library/Caches/com.operasoftware.Opera\n\n*Re-install Opera and open it for the first time (keep Wifi off)\n\n*Delete auto_update in /Applications/Opera.app/Contents/Versions/49..../Opera Framework.framework/Helpers\n\n*Turn Wifi on and relaunch Opera, it will stuck when autoupdate \n", "Q: Has the WiFi KRACK vulnerability been patched for iOS? There is a new vulnerability in WPA2 called KRACK (short for Key Reinstallation Attack), as described in The Guardian article: \n 'All WiFi networks' are vulnerable to hacking, security expert discovers'\nAccording to the article:  \n\nThe vulnerability affects a number of operating systems and devices,\n  the report said, including Android, Linux, Apple, Windows, OpenBSD,\n  MediaTek, Linksys and others.\n\nHave there been any security releases for iOS fixing this?\n\nA: Updates released 31 October 2017\nApple has released updates that include a fix for the KRACK vulnerability for macOS, iOS, tvOS and watchOS. To get the updates:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 and security updates for Sierra & El Capitan -\nLaunch the App Store and select the Updates tab.\n\n*iOS 11.1 -\nGo to Settings > General > Software Update\n\n*watchOS 4.1 -\nLaunch the Watch app on your iPhone, then go to General > Software Update\n\n*tvOS 11.1 -\nFor Apple TV 4 (and 4K) go to Settings > System > Software Updates and Select Update Software.\nFor Apple TV (2nd/3rd generation) go to Settings > General > Update Software\n\n\nIt's Apple's policy to not comment on security vulnerabilities until they are patched, and even when they do, they are often quite vague about it.\n\nAbout Apple security updates\nFor our customers' protection, Apple doesn't disclose, discuss, or\n  confirm security issues until an investigation has occurred and\n  patches or releases are available. Recent releases are listed on the\n  Apple security updates page.\n\nHowever, with a little detective work, we can gain some insight. Looking at the CVEs assigned to this particular vulnerability,* we can get listing of the issues that should be addressed by Apple when they decide to issue a security patch:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*CVE-2017-13077: Reinstallation of the pairwise encryption key (PTK-TK) in the 4-way handshake. \n  \n*CVE-2017-13078: Reinstallation of the group key (GTK) in the 4-way handshake. \n  \n*CVE-2017-13079: Reinstallation of the integrity group key (IGTK) in the 4-way handshake. \n  \n*CVE-2017-13080: Reinstallation of the group key (GTK) in the group key handshake.\n  \n*CVE-2017-13081: Reinstallation of the integrity group key (IGTK) in the group key handshake. \n  \n*CVE-2017-13082: Accepting a retransmitted Fast BSS Transition (FT) Reassociation Request and reinstalling the\n  pairwise encryption key (PTK-TK) while processing it. \n  \n*CVE-2017-13084: Reinstallation of the STK key in the PeerKey handshake.\n  \n*CVE-2017-13086: reinstallation of the Tunneled Direct-Link Setup\n  (TDLS) PeerKey (TPK) key in the TDLS handshake. \n  \n*CVE-2017-13087: reinstallation of the group key (GTK) when processing a Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame. \n  \n*CVE-2017-13088: reinstallation of the integrity group key (IGTK) when processing a Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame.\n  \n\nAlso, this ZDNet Article - Here's every patch for KRACK Wi-Fi vulnerability available right now (Oct. 16, 2017) indicates that vendors are responding quickly and Apple has confirmed that patches are in beta.\n\nApple confirmed it has a fix in beta for iOS, MacOS, WatchOS and TVOS,\n  and will be rolling it out in a software update in a few weeks.\n\n\n*Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®) is a list of common identifiers for publicly known cyber security vulnerabilities. Use of \"CVE Identifiers (CVE IDs),\" which are assigned by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) from around the world, ensures confidence among parties when used to discuss or share information about a unique software vulnerability, provides a baseline for tool evaluation, and enables data exchange for cyber security automation.\n\n\n\nA: Rene Ritchie, the editor in chief of iMore, reports that this vulnerability is fixed in all current macOS, watchOS, tvOS and iOS betas.\nUntil the updates ship, many security blogs recommend to use VPN and sites protected with SSL to safeguard any information transmitted over Wi-Fi. \nWhile SSL does not guarantee data safety from a KRACK attack, it makes it significantly harder. However, KRACK gains access deep enough to possibly access data prior to encryption. \n\nA: Considering vulnerability has been just published (at the time of this question asked) and I doubt that it was sent to any manufacturers first (as that would be very difficult considering number of parties to inform about this) - it will take awhile for Apple to bundle new update for all existing devices and release it.\nAs it has always been before Apple does not do urgent patch of iOS/Mac OS for only a single vulnerability, it bundles a few of the fixes/changes together into an update.\nAlso making a fix, testing, verifying, releasing etc takes time. So it won't be addressed instantly.\n", "Q: XCode 8.3 - How many times can we deploy to an iOS Device with an expired Developer ID? Good day everyone, I'm developing an iOS application and I was wondering how many times I can deploy to my iPad Mini (the device I use to test) without signing up for the iOS Development Program again. I had signed up before, but I don't have the cash right now to sign up again. \nDoes anyone know if there's a limit to how many times I can deploy to a device? I'm a bit uneasy because I might hit a restriction later on and it would stall my development process.\nThank you. \n(If this belongs to StackOverflow instead, kindly let me know)\n\nA: Source:\nYou can deploy to your personal devices as many times as you want; there's no restriction on deploys of this type.\nYou only have to pay the membership fee if you want to use the more advanced features such as TestFlight and the App Store.\nUpdate: \n\n\n*\n\n*Here's a list of supported capabilities that require either a free account or paid one.\n\n*The provisioning profile is only good for 7 days.  After that you need to generate a new one and deploy it to the device.\n\n*Max number of connected devices is limited to 3.\n\n", "Q: SafariBookmarksSyncAgent makes new iMac freeze For the past few weeks my new iMac kept freezing. After many, many hours with Apple tech support, both in the store and on the phone, we narrowed it down to something called SafariBookmarksSyncAgent which is sucking up all my memory, putting the memory pressure into the red, then off the scale.\nTo use my computer, I have to keep the Activity Monitor up on the screen so I can force quit SafariBookmarksSyncAgent when it pops up every 3 to 5 seconds.\nNo one at tech support has been able to figure it out. We've tried safe mode, we've unchecked Safari (I use Firefox, not Safari as my browser) under iCloud in all devices in my house. The Apple tech people say they never even heard of SafariBookmarksSyncAgent. Right now, the engineering department is supposed to be looking into it.\nHow can I solve this issue?\n\nA: I found a solution that worked for me.  It involved updating the permissions for my home directory, as indicated in the following article:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203538\n\nA: Resetting user folder permissions didn't work for me.

It connects to all other Wi-Fi and hotspot devices but it does not connect to my university Wi-Fi.  \nI have also done diagnostics; still does not become connected.\n\nA: This isn't an Apple issue per se.  It's an issue with the organization's (in this case, the university's) security protocol not allowing you onto their network.\nYou indicate that your WiFi is functional\n\nit is getting connected to all other wifi and hotspot devices\n\nIt's not going to work everywhere and then suddenly stop working on one particular network.  A symptom like this points to an authentication issue.\nMore than likely, your Uni is using an accounting and authentication mechanism like RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service). True...nobody really uses \"dial in\" any more, but the acronym stuck.\nYou need to contact your organization's IT support department to assist you in getting your device(s) authorized on their network.  Once they do this, you will be able to access the resources you are authorized to utilize.\n\nA: IF you have the choice of registering a device with your university network access setting. You can find your MAC address for specific USB ethernet adapter through advanced --> hardware and then copy that MAC address to manually register with your university network access. This is happening because of your laptop and USB adapter has different MAC address. \n", "Q: How to use iPhone 6 back up on iPhone 4s? My iPhone 6 broke down and I've tried to use latest backup on my old 4s with no luck.\nIs there any way I can use it for my old 4s?\nThanks\n\nA: It may be that the 4s is an iOS version behind:\nIf the iPhone 6, was/is on iOS 10/11(how to check it https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201685), there’re no way to do this, if not, try update the iPhone 4s to iOS 9.3.5 (how to update https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204), and then retry restoring the iPhone 4s from your backup.\n", "Q: How to disable middle click?

I have various folders with custom icons (some added by Resilio Sync, and some by other things) which drive me crazy in the terminal.  Is there any way to hide them from the shell?\nI know how to hide them from the Finder, and that's not what I'm asking about.  Deleting them is also not what I'm asking about.\nIs there any way to make them invisible to the shell?\n\nA: Not really. What you seek isn't something shells try to support. Shells are really about open access to a system, not hidden access.\nSome shell commands and functions will ignore directories and files that are prefixed with a . by default. For example, ls does this:\nIanCsiMac:~/code/tmp\n> ls\n\nIanCsiMac:~/code/tmp\n> ls -lah\ntotal 16\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 ian  staff   102B Oct 15 15:06 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  44 ian  staff   1.5K Oct 10 11:03 ..\n-rw-r--r--@  1 ian  staff   6.0K Oct 15 15:06 .DS_Store\n\nBut the .-prefixed file in the above example isn't considered \"hidden\". Just \"not displayed in the default view\". Any sort of hiding like this would necessitate you rename your files and folders so they're prefixed with a . and then they'd also disappear by default from Finder.\nAs you can see from answers on other SE sub-sites (1, 2, 3), the prefix-with-a-dot is really the only consistent way to keep a file or folder out of the normal view of most shell functions and commands.\n", "Q: App Store still shows download option for Mac OS High Sierra?

This is what solved it for me. (I'm running macOS 10.13)\n\nA: You have a program that is/was using the hard drive. \nYou could try ejecting it using Disc Utility.\nLogging out should also always work, although the only programs that get terminated are the ones in the user account that is logged out.\nIf you don't want to log out, quit any apps you are no longer using.\nMac Mail is notorious for hanging onto files that have been attached to emails. If you attached a file from an external disk, Mail might not have let it go. Quitting Mail solves this problem.\nThe Finder sometimes doesn't let go of files either, like after you do a QuickLook on a file. Normally you can't quit the Finder except using Activity Monitor (Utilities folder) and also check and see what programs are open that may be using it.\n\nA: It might be that your Finder is still indexing those files that you have in your hardisk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try quit Photos application first\n\n*Switch off hardisk indexing for finder sudo mdutil -Ei off \"/Volumes/Name_of_Drive\"\n", "Q: Why Wi-Fi is getting turned-on automatically in iOS 11 I am using iOS 11 in iPhone 5S but its wi-fi is getting turned-on automatically, is there any way to stop it. \n\nA: Source:\nBeginning in iOS 11, the system will automatically try and reconnect to known devices using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi at 5am every morning (local time) if they have only been toggled off using the Control Center.\nYou 'fix' this behaviour by turning both radios off inside of `Settings' (depending on your device locale and language, \"Wi-Fi\" might also be named \"WLAN\" as in the pictures below):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings -> Wi-Fi.\n\n*Switch the Wi-Fi radio button to off.\n\n\n \n", "Q: I need to identify a name of an iPhone authentication function I saw today someone transferring data from two iPhones (not sure which models).\nI suspect that was for the sake of backup/restore data one phone from another, but I'm not entirely sure about that also.  \nWhen he needed to authenticate that the 2nd phone is really is the phone that needs that specific data, there was an animation of bunch of blue dots in shape of a circle on the 1st phone (the phone that should send the other one the data), and the 2nd one has needed to scan this animation (much like QR code) in order to get authenticated.  \nWhat I want to know if this function is integrated in the iOS, and if it is, what is it called?  \nUpdate: I've added a short GIF that demonstrate what I've saw.\n\nA: Yes, the function is included in iOS 11 and is called \"Automatic Setup\".\nIt is designed to get you up and running quickly when you replace your phone with a new one.

I would remove everything from the desktop of an 'about to be connected' mac - so you can manage any clashes. \nAdd your Desktop and Documents files to iCloud Drive says \n\nYou can organize and combine folders from multiple Macs when you turn on Desktop and Documents on those computers too. After you turn on Desktop and Documents on a second Mac, you'll find its files in folders with the same name as your second Mac inside your original Desktop and Documents folders. Then you can combine your files manually, but iCloud doesn’t automatically merge the files in case you want to keep them separate. Any edits you make are seamlessly updated in iCloud Drive.

I have confirmed that nightshift is off and that no screen accessibility settings are enabled.\nI tried to capture the difference in the image below with limited success. \n\nIn person, the one on the left is noticeable warmer looking, and the one on the right is redder than the one in the middle (or the middle one is greener than the one on the right).\nCould any other setting be effecting the display colors? Or is this color variation just expected for three different devices with different histories?\n\nA: Do you know the history of each of these iPhones?\nThis may not necessarily explain the difference in your case, but one factor that can result in this difference is the use of non-genuine parts. For example, I've seen this type of differentiation in iPhones that have had screens replaced with 3rd party screens.\nOtherwise you could check that the following settings found in Settings > General > Accessibility are the same in all iPhones:\n\n\n*\n\n*Display Accommodations > Colour Filters\n\n*Display Accommodations > Auto-Brightness\n\n*Display Accommodations > Reduce White Point\n\n*Increase Contrast > Reduce Transparency\n\n*Increase Contrast > Darken Colours\n\n", "Q: enable program for all users (root included) installed via Terminal from source (tarball) I can to enable some program installed from tarball...\nusing this command:\necho 'export PATH=/usr/local/SomeProgram/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile\necho 'export MANPATH=/usr/local/SomeProgram/man:$MANPATH' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nBut how to do it for all users (including root profile)?\n\nA: $ more /etc/paths\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n$\n\n$ more /etc/manpaths\n/usr/share/man\n/usr/local/share/man\n$ \n\nTry with this like Root:\n# echo '/usr/local/SomeProgram/bin' >> /etc/paths\n# echo '/usr/local/SomeProgram/man' >> /etc/manpaths\n\n", "Q: Is it normal for LaunchD to write over 600 megs of data to /private/var/db/dyld/dyld_shared_cache_x86_64?

As you'll learn, there's a quite big overlap conceptually between macOS and Linux. Most everything in macOS has a Linux counterpart and vice versa.\nIn this case the dyld_shared_cache is somewhat similar to the /etc/ld.so.cache file on Linux. On Linux this cache contains the most recent shared libraries, which are essentially the same as dynamic libraries on macOS.\n", "Q: Can macOS High Sierra write to NTFS external drives? I have updated my MacBook Pro to macOS High Sierra 10.13. I previously used Paragon NTFS but now it's not working so I uninstalled it. However I noticed I can still read and write to my external hard drive without any other app. \nDoes this mean macOS High Sierra natively supports writing to NTFS external drives?\n\nA: You actually can, and I just did it.\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*note the label of your NTFS volume.\n\n*edit /etc/fstab even if it doesn't exist, e.g. with sudo vi /etc/fstab\n\n*Add this line for every NTFS volume: LABEL=\"VOLUME_NAME_WITHOUT_QUOTES\" none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse\n\n*Re-plug your drive.\n\n\nYou will not see the drive in Finder's \"Devices\", because this option requires nobrowse to work, but it is mounted in /Volumes/<ntfs_label>\n\nA: By default, no, High Sierra only gives read support for NTFS. You can enable write support with popular free tools like FUSE + NTFS-3G.\nTested and working for free on High Sierra: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/213575/62697\nIf you have Paragon or Tuxera, then you paid for a support and they will certainly help you to install the latest compatible version of their respective softwares.\n\nA: It's impossible to write to a NTFS drive on High Sierra without a third-party solution. You might have FUSE installed. To check if you have it installed go to the System Preferences and check if you see the FUSE icon there.\n", "Q: OS X Execute a script while printing Is it possible to make OS X execute a script when document is printed ?\nMy printer is connected to a power switch which is controlled with a REST API and the idea is to switch the printer on only when it is needed (basically while printing).\nAny command (bash, AppleScript) can be used if it can make a call to a rest API (http://10.10.0.1/switchon).\n\nA: Common Unix Printing System\nmacOS uses the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) for printing.

Cryptocurrency wallet bter.com/mobileapp are asking me to install its app directly from corporate repository. It's firs time when I'm able to see such thing.\nIs it safe to work with this app? Or it can possibly steal some of my data because of ”mistrust“?\n\nP.S.: I know how to avoid this popup window and start working. The only thing that I want to specify is how safe to use it.\n\nA: Generally speaking, no, it is not safe as the pop-up states. As you don't know where the app comes from and it has not been checked by Apple's reviewers.\nYou'd need to install the app developers' certificate to install this app. That certificate could be misused to extract data/control phone/misuse information. Companies often use their own certificates via mobile device management to do such things. Like wiping a stolen phone or blocking the user after leaving the company.\nFurther Explained\nThe warning is generated to protect users to install apps from untrusted (not validated, unknown) developers. This mostly occurs on apps being downloaded outside of given app-stores.\nIn this case (I don't know the app) you really want to lookup the developers site and references.\nMaybe it's an open source project. Open Source projects produce this warning but in many cases this warning can be ignored as the project has been reviewed by a bunch of users stating it is safe to install. Still: Caution!.\nA search shows a company with the same name is already in the iOS App Store. Though, I don't know whether it's the same company. And there seems to be a reason why the app is not listed in the app store.\n", "Q: Show application switcher on all connected displays Is there a way to see the application switcher (the one pops up when hitting ⌘+⇥ / CMD+TAB) on all connected displays? \n\nA: Open a terminal and run these commands:\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock appswitcher-all-displays -bool true\nkillall Dock\n\nTry restarting if it doesn't work after killall Dock (it worked perfectly for me, and I'm running on Apple Silicon).\nRevert by running the same commands, but replace true with false.\nI wanted to share that as a summary of what I've found, and especially because there's no need to buy software to do what the OP asked. I give all credit for the solution to those who shared before me; I encourage you to upvote/thank Georgy Jose in Super user and Taylor Hodge - Gist\n\nA: To my knowledge, you can't make the default application switcher do that. 3rd party apps definitely can... but many don't seem to do it. \nThe only third party app I know that does this is: \nContexts (~$10), but it's also pretty different from the default app switcher. \nAnother one I wanted to mention is Witch (~$14), that is closer to looking like the native application switcher, but isn't able to show up in all of your screens. It can however be shown in the screen with the active window or in the same screen with your mouse pointer.\nBoth of these have trial versions available.\n\nThe big thing for me with these third party application switchers is that it is possible to hide applications from them. \nFor example... if you use Path Finder, you may want to hide Finder, so you don't accidentally open it. Or if an application just doesn't have the \"hide dock icon\" option, meaning that it will show up in the application switcher by default, you can hide it in the third party application switcher. Many reasons for why you'd want to hide an app from the application switcher.\nI personally use Witch and Ubar, which is a Dock replacement that also can hide applications... Contexts comes with its own dock replacement (sort of). As a heavy Spaces user, I really like how the \"Sidebar\", as it's called in Contexts, can divide the open apps into groups by spaces. Makes it pretty nice and organized. \nThe thing I could never get used to with Contexts was the actual application switcher and its vertical list style (with no option to make it horizontal). I spent way more time looking at the list trying to find the right app compared to the native horizontal style, which is not available in Contexts. \n\nAs a bonus I just wanted to mention HyperSwitch, which mainly brings really good previews to either its own custom app switcher or extends the native app switcher to show a preview, but as far as this question goes, it will not extend the application switcher to multiple screens.\n", "Q: How to install older Xcode version from the App Store I want to install Xcode 6 or 7 but I don't have a stable internet connection so installing the .dmg file with around 2-4GB file size will probably end badly.

This would be possible if I install it through the App Store but I can't seem to find how I can get specific versions.\nIs there a way to do this or another method that would suit my situation?\n\nA: if you have previously purchased the xcode version you are interested in, you can download it again from the purchased tab in the app store\nand\n\"There are older versions of Xcode available at the Apple Developer website, but as long as you just use the latest non-beta version of the SDK, you should be fine.

I want to transform my list of reminders in Reminders.app into a checklist inside a note in Notes.app. I tried dragging the list from the list of lists from Reminders to Notes and that didn't work. I tried dragging the contents of the Reminders list to a new Notes note and that imported the content with a [ ] before each item. Is there a way to convert theses into Notes' native checklist items?\n\nA: The following AppleScript script will take the selected Reminders in Reminders and make a new Note in Checklist format in Notes. This can be run in Script Editor or saved as an AppleScript application. \n\n\n*\n\n*Note: As this script uses UI Scripting, when run from Script Editor, it must be added to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility in order to run.

Digging into the folder structure, I found that all of the attachments I had 'removed' from the emails are still present in the filesystem, deeply nested in the ~/Library/Mail/ folder.\nI've tried quitting and restarting Mail, rebuilding the mailboxes, and restarting the computer, but the files remain.\nAre others experiencing this behaviour? Is it possible to have the attachments removed from the hard drive when 'removed' from the email?\nRunning macOS Sierra 10.12.6\n\nA: I stumbled onto a solution after several hours. Hopefully this can help others. \nBackground\nI wanted to remove attachments larger than 1MB from emails older than 5 years. I made a smart mailbox with criteria for \"has attachments\" and \"date recieved not in the past 5 years\". I did a \"select all\" on the ~25k results and chose \"Message > Remove Attachments\" from the menu bar. Mail chugged away for half an hour, and afterwards the attachments were removed from the email messages, but the \"Library/Mail\" folder hadn't changed in size. Drilling into the \"Library/Mail\" folder structure in the Finder, I confirmed that the files were still there.\nThe missing step\nI have my email sorted in folders in the Mail sidebar:\nOn my mac\n     Project 1\n     Project 2\n     Etc\n\nIn order for the removed attachments to actually be deleted from the file system, I had to click on each folder in Mail's sidebar. Something about opening the folder in Mail seemed to cause that folder's messages' removed attachments to be deleted from the file system.\n**Important to mention that this was using a POP email account, and the messages were long ago deleted from the server, so there wasn't an issue of Mail re-downoading the attachments from the server.\n", "Q: A book in iBooks won't finish deleting. When tidying my downloaded iBooks (not all from the Apple Store)my iPad got stuck trying to remove a download.

If so, turn it off.\n", "Q: Upgrade to High Sierra installed version of Fuse too old for OS I just updated to High Sierra, now I see this this message (as shown in the screen shot)\n\"Installed version of macOS unsupported.\nThe installed version of FUSE it too old for the operating system ...\"\n\n\nCould somebody help me -\na) Find out why / how and by whom fuse was installed (I have not done it specifically as far as I can recall)\nb) How to upgrade it to remove the error\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: If you are not aware of any app needing FUSE you can remove it. You should see an icon in System Preferences for FUSE. You can remove or update from there:\n \nSee also: FUSE for macOS website\n\nA: Going to the FUSE for macOS website, downloading and installing the latest version of FUSE from here solved he problem.  Less hassle than trying to find the App using the outdated version.

I would also check every week for updates and patch the OS in case it's something that gets remedied or tightened up.\nBasically, watchdog is designed to monitor for performance, it's clearly gotten a signal or guidance to collect some more details for slow wakes. Other than that - without Apple's source code and a session with their engineers publicly explaining why this specific event was triggered, you may have to monitor this and focus on other aspects like specific apps crashing / failure to wake entirely, etc...\n", "Q: Notification Center \"Show Message Preview\" doesn't work In Notifications Preferences, I have the \"Show Message Preview\" option disabled for Mail.app, but nonetheless, message previews still appear in Notification Center.\nHow can I fix this? \nmacOS Sierra, Mail.app 10.3\n\n\nA: The checkbox only affects the notifications when they display as a notification, not when they are subsequently shown in Notification Center.

Previously with El Capitan, an app such as smcFanControl (2.6) could furrow in an obscure way into the OS.\nHas something changed in either Sierra or High Sierra? After sleeping and waking up, the same app (in the same version) now requires re-entering the sudo password, or otherwise it fails to run in the menu bar.\n\nA: It has nothing to do with a (perceived) \"higher standard\" for menu bar icons, it has to do with the privilege level of the process you are attempting to run (or restart from sleep).\nIn this case, to access the process that controls the fans, you need to have root level privileges.  Until you grant those privileges to that process, it won't run and thusly won't show up in your menu.\n\nA: Not to my knowledge, while it is true that security improvements were made with the new (High Sierra) release, the issue you are describing seems to be unrelated to it. I tried to replicate your scenario but it works fine for me.  \nThings to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall the application. \n\n\n*\n\n*Maybe best done with AppCleaner to remove all associated files first.\n\n\n*Be sure it is installed to the Applications folder on your Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*This I believe sets certain privileges to the app which it may not get if inside other, more obscure directories.  \n\n\n*Look at your Keychain and try re-authenticating the app. This is best done after you reinstall it and ripping out any related entries\n\n\nI hope I have given you a couple more things to try, let me know if you were successful using one or more of these methods.\n", "Q: Performance issues with Dynadock after upgrading to OS X Sierra 10.12.6 I just took an update today of OS Sierra 10.12.6 on my work laptop (MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)).  Which I had been putting it off until now.\nAfter the upgrade, I noticed that the frame rate on the monitors hanging off my Dynadock are terribly slugish. Full disclosure, I am running 4 monitors AND my laptop screen is open as well.\nIn terms of delay, it takes about one second after a mouse click to start to see the screen update and another second for it to finish. If I click around a bit, I often get a cascading like delay.\nThe rate at which the docking bar appeared on monitors that are attached via the dynadock was always very slow, but now everything is just as bad as the docking bar performance on those particular screens.\nA quick perusal of Ask Different seems to indicate that no one has ever asked a question about dynadock's with the MacBookPro, so this may be new territory.\nDoes anyone know who is responsible for the Dynadock drivers? Toshiba doesn't seem to provide a MacOSX driver on their website, yet the Dynadock seems to work perfectly (slugish-ness aside).\nI thought it was an Apple thing then, but can find no record of it.\nAny ideas of who to reach out to would be appreciated.\n\nA: The issue is mostly resolved and performance is better.  I went to displaylink.org and downloaded the latest display driver for OSX.  This appears to be the source for OSX compatible Toshiba Displaylink drivers, as Toshiba only seems to publish Windows version on their support site.  After installing the new driver a colleague  mentioned that I should make sure that mission control has screens as \"Separate workspaces\".   \nI confirmed that I already had this setting checked, but did a test with it un-checked, and I can confirm that this made update performance worse.\nSo in general, having the new latest driver did seem to restore performance, however, I am still seeing per application issues.  For instance, I can drag the Safari and Chrome browsers across the Displaylink screens as smooth as butter, but dragging Firefox is choppy and typing into the browser is very difficult to do with any kind of fluidity.    \n", "Q: Iphone 6s, question about recovering photos from iCloud on to the new phone. Please help. I got a new phone and I have everything backed up on iCloud. Everything restored (apps, phone contacts, etc.) exceptfor the photos. How do I get them from iCloud on to my new phone? Thanks\n\nA: If you did a restore from iCloud backup, your photos should appear.\nIf not, go to settings -> Your name -> iCloud -> Photos and turn on the following:\niCloud Photo Library & Keep and Download Originals\nIf the photos dont show, check your iCloud storage for photo backup size and iCloud backups. If you have an iCloud backup that has a favorable date, then restoring that could be in your favor.\n", "Q: Trouble with importing photos from iPhone to Mac when I have enabled iCloud Photo Library and selected \"Optimize iPhone Storage\" I have enabled iCloud Photo Library and selected \"Optimize iPhone Storage\" on my iPhone. There are 20000+ photos and videos in the \"All Photos\" album on my iPhone, but since the storage of my iPhone is only 16GB so most of the photos and videos on my iPhone are not full-resolution copies. Now when I connect my iPhone to my Mac and try to import all the photos and videos to a blank library in the Photos app, it says there are only 200+ photos available for importing. Is there a way I can import all the photos and videos on my iPhone to my Mac?\nNote that I don't want to turn on iCloud Photo Library on my Mac Photos app, because at some point I will reach the storage limit of iCloud Photo Library and I will have to start deleting photos from it, and I don't want to lose the local copies of them on my Mac. \nMy situation\n\n\n*\n\n*My iPhone has only 16GB of storage and it fills up quickly because I take tons of photos and videos. I don't want to import them every week, and I also want to look at photos or videos from one or two years ago, so I purchased 200GB of iCloud storage and enabled \"Optimize iPhone Storage\". This works great.\n\n*I want to incrementally back up the photos and videos to an external hard drive which hosts my Photos library. \n\n\nA: I’m not sure I can address everything in your post, but here are some things that might help narrow down some options.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have “optimize photos” on your iOS device/iPhone - then it is designed to upload the full, original images to iCloud. Full stop.\n\n*Then you are expected to download those photos to all other devices from the ful version in iCloud. \n\n*At best - you always get the perfect version and the downsampling only happens to the local / non-permanent copy that’s on a device with low storage space internally.\n\n*At worst - you fill up the iCloud space and have to buy more to store all the originals - and you still retain the full size versions online, but at a cost.\n\n\nDepending on where you split from this general idea - you may or may not have some issues that I didn’t anticipate, but I would probably reach out to Apple Support to verify your iCloud is correct and full and see options to get everything from the phone to iCloud, everything from the Mac to iCloud and then sort out the options.\nGetting the local cached copy from the iPhone is very against the design so I would think you’d need specialized skills or software much more involved and time consuming than just fitting into the intended use pattern.\n\nA: After some days of researching, here is the solution that works for myself the best. \nRecap of the my situation (the applicable situation) : I use iCloud Photos Library. The iCloud storage is 200GB and becomes full after 1~2 years of usage. I have a 4-bay Synology NAS with RAID 0 enabled, and several large portable hard drives, and I also use Google Photos (unlimited space) and Amazon Cloud drive (Prime Photos, also unlimited), so I trust my ability of safekeeping the photos and don't want to spend extra money on iCloud storage. \nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*I created a new Photos library on my Mac and enabled iCloud in preference. So it downloaded all the photos from iCloud to my Mac. \n\n*On Mac, add all photos to a new album called \"backed up on \". This new album will get sync'd to my iCloud and my iPhone. After that I will disable iCloud for this library on Mac. \n\n*On my iPhone, use an app called \"Mass Delete\" (free) to delete all the photos older than 6 months. \n\n*(Optional) for photos older than 6 months and I want to keep a copy on my iPhone, use AirDrop to copy them from Mac back to my iPhone. \n\n*Several months later, when my iCloud storage is full again, I delete all the photos in the \"backed up on \" album on my iPhone. \n\n*Another several months later, when my iCloud storage is full once again, I will start over from step #1. \nThe pros of this solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*I always have photos at least up to 6 months old on my iPhone/iCloud all the time. I never have to empty it.\n\n*Imported photos don't overlap, or in other words, there are no duplicates on my Mac. \n\n*I can still take full advantage of iCloud Photos Library and the \"Optimize iPhone Storage\" feature. \n\n*I don't need to use Photo Stream.\n\n*I don't need any other 3rd party software to do the import. Most of the photos imported to my Mac has the latest organization and edition as they are before they get deleted. \n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Overtime my photos will be scattered in multiple Photos libraries. But I am fine with that. \n\n*For the 6 months of photos in the \"backed up on \" album, they may get out of sync between the iPhone/iCloud version and the Mac version if I edit them. But I don't edit photos often so I can live with that. \n\n*Step #3 requires a 3rd party app. There are possibly other ways to do this time-filtered delete using the built-in software. \n\n", "Q: Triangle on my pictures I have taken pictures on my iPhone 8 Plus but when I try to look at them on my MacBook running Sierra 10.12, they all have a triangle on them with an exclamation point. \nI am not able to edit the photos. What can I do to fix this?\n\nA: I’m guessing your MacBook isn’t on High Sierra and you’re viewing the new photo formats. \nHave you looked at the settings app, camera, formats and checked JPEG instead of high efficiency? If you want to maintain high efficiency formats, upgrading now or eventually would be the plan. \n", "Q: Speaker and camera of my MacBook Air aren't working after installing windows Yesterday I installed Windows 8.1 on my MacBook Air on the partition that contained macOS, so the only OS that exists on my laptop is windows.

Is Apple store capable of upgrading the app even if one implementation is written in Xamarin.iOS and the other one in Swift? \n\nA: Sure - the store delivers binary content that it code signs as complete so it doesn’t matter how you got the submission to Apple. \nNow, the end user experience could still be a mess if you don’t have a smooth migration plan for app data, settings and what happens when someone restores a backup from 6 months ago onto the new version of the app. Those things are hard to test, possibly difficult to program and not something that was designed into your data model currently. \n", "Q: Hangouts messages on High Sierra It seems like I cannot send messages on Google Hangouts via Messages after upgrading to High Sierra.\n\nI still receive the messages because I'm authenticated.\nIs there any hope to keep writing in Hangouts via Messages?\n\nA: This is the original fix I saw on the MacRumors forum:\nhttps://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gtalk-messages-solution-found-high-sierra.2073393/\n\nGo to system settings and go to Internet Accounts and delete your google account.\nOpen Terminal\nfind ~/Library/Preferences -name \"*iChat*\" -delete\n\nthen\nrm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Messages\n\nthen\nrm -rf ~/Library/Messages\n\nand reboot\nNow open Messages and add your google account via Jabber.

Once you are certain that you can boot from it and operate properly, you can then do a clean installation on your internal drive.\nTo make a clone of your drive, you can use a commercial application like Carbon Copy Cloner or use dd in Terminal to make the copy:\ndd if=/dev/diskX of=/dev/diskY bs=1M\n\nWhere X is your source (internal) disk identifier and Y is your target (USB) disk identifier. \nWhether you use a commercial piece of software or the terminal command you need to make sure your target disk is the same size or larger than the source.\n", "Q: What are specs of this MagSafe wire, and what is its purpose? I need to repair a MagSafe power adapter, which has a damaged cable. \nAs you can see in the photos, there is damage to what appears to be shielding.\n\nUpdate: This frayed wire is not “shielding.” See the accepted answer and its comments for details.\n\n\n\nI’m leery of simply applying (more ugly, ineffective) tape as a long term option. I’m considering using some higher quality shrink-wrap or the like, but I‘d also like to account for the fraying. \nThe problem is, I cannot find any information online about the frayed part, such as the material and the function(s) it provides. \nCan you provide detailed specifications of the frayed part of the cable, including how it works / what it does?\nPresumably, I can use the answer to inform my repair decisions. \nOf course, I also welcome comments you might have about how to or whether to repair this damage. \n\nA: There are two cables that come out of the adapter (white brick) - a white cable and a bare cable (it's actually black on the very end of the cable at the adapter end).  The bare cable wraps around the white cable.  White being positive 18V and and black being ground.\nCan you repair this?  \nYes.  However it will involve destroying the case of the adapter because it's held together with adhesive.  I did this once and had to reassemble it with duct tape.  However, instead of fixing the cable, replacements can be had relatively inexpensively on eBay.  \nHowever, I highly suggest getting a new adapter because the case will never quite close properly and you run the risk of breaking the plastic because the adhesive is so strong.  If you do get a new adapter, get a genuine Apple and not a knock-off.  \n\nA: I believe the guide that you're after to repair your magsafe should be this:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Power+Cord+5-Pin+MagSafe+Connector+and+Cable+Replacement/21842\nAs to the detail spec of the shielding am not entirely sure.\nAlso, from the link I gave you, it seems like Amazon does not sell the replacement part any longer :( Might have to source somewhere else(At your own risk).\nAlternative repair without replacing the cable would be this:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Restoring+Apple+AC+Adapter+Broken+Cable/24487\nPersonally I would advise with all the hassle might as well head down to your official Apple store and get a new one.

I have a folder full of white SVG icons, but preview shows them over a white background, and I can't find a way to easily preview them all.

I have noticed that an app I use has been requiring me to download tons of data whilst in the app despite there not being any new (internal, I.e. non-AppStore based) updates. As far as I can tell at some point in time, perhaps near the release of iOS 11, Apple added a new feature which causes iPhones to delete app data (documents etc.) partially or completely. I’ve seen a few people mention this online but I haven’t heard of any solution besides ”delete some data yourself” which doesn’t seem to always work either. Is there any way to disable this? Thanks in advance...\n\nA: In iOS 11 you can have the system 'offload' rarely-used apps and their associated data.  In prior iOS versions, once an app is deleted all its data is deleted, too.  Now you can change that.\nBy default, this selection is turned on.  It's very simple to turn it off (and back on, if you want).  You can do this by individual app for the the entire device.  \nSource:\nIndividual App\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> General -> iPhone Storage\n\n*Tap the app you want to offload\n\n\n\n\n\n*Tap Offload App and then confirm\n\n\n\nIts documents and data will be stored on your device. And, when you reinstall the app, all of the data is automatically restored.\nAutomatically for the device\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> General -> iPhone Storage\n\n*Tap on Enable next to Offload Unused Apps\n\nThat's all you need to do.  If you don't want this to be done automatically any more, simple disable the selection.\n\nA: Strange as it is, turning offloading on actually fixed the problem. \nAs far as I can tell somehow when updating on low (which can be up to 5 GB's, I really don't know the specifics) storage, some app data is deleted to make room. I guess somehow it's assumed to be residual data and deleted when the update completes.\nHowever, when I did turn offloading on I always had just enough space to update without mysteriously triggering this behavior. \nBut as of late 2018, I think they changed how this works since I was down to very low storage (in the MB's) even with offloading, but my frequently used apps would be protected. Though not all, as I had Telegram of all things get offloaded while I was messaging someone with it.\nI guess the moral story is to never run low on storage because with or without offloading there are some pretty bizarre kinks that haven't been worked out just yet.\n", "Q: Can I be on bluetooth tethering + wifi, and select which traffic goes through each? I have found some wifi networks have 'overly-aggressive' firewalls.  E.G. many will block SSH traffic.  The wifi signal is otherwise strong and good, and I'd like to use it for most of my internet work. \nI would like to direct all SSH connections to go through the bluetooth tethering.

I.e. you route the network packets not based on the IP address of the destination, but on different criteria.\nOn macOS this is done using pf (see the man pages for pf.conf and pfctl).\nIn your case you need to create a policy rule that specifies that packets with destination port 22 will be routed over the tethering interface.\n", "Q: Double dot on spotlight calculator So I'm playing around with the Spotlight calculator, and came across a weird thing:\nIf I type\n1..1, I receive 0.1\n5..6, I receive 3\n523..6.1, I receive 31.38\nDoes anybody know what mathematical function this is?\nEdit: This works on macOS Sierra 10.12.2, as for people in the comments, it looks like three dots are required on macOS High Sierra.\n\nA: What is happening, is the calculator splits the numbers and dots into the following:\n5..6=3 turns into 5 * .6 = 3\nAs we know that . is another way of saying 'multiply' its simply, 5 multiplied by .6\nAs for 523..6.1=31.38, it turns into 523 * (.6 * .1) = 31.38\n", "Q: Can I upgrade MacBookPro13\"(Early 2011-1333 MHZ DDR3-2.3 GHZ i5) to 16GB 1600 MHZ RAM?

I have already associated the files with Firefox — it opens them by default — but the files continue to show the exec icon. What I am looking for is a way to make macOS recognize the mht file extension: for eg, when a PDF file is renamed in macOS, only the name of the file is highlighted but not the extension, however when a mht file is renamed, both the name of the file and the file extension (mht) are hightlighed.\nI tried browsing to Firefox -> Show Package Contents -> Contents and, since it was missing, I added mht to the Info.plist using TextEdit:\n<dict>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeExtensions</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>html</string>\n        <string>htm</string>\n        <string>shtml</string>\n        <string>xht</string>\n        <string>xhtml</string>\n        <string>mht</string> <!-- added -->\n    </array>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeIconFile</key>\n    <string>document.icns</string>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeName</key>\n    <string>HTML Document</string>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeOSTypes</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>HTML</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n    <string>Viewer</string>\n</dict>\n\nThis did not work. Is there any way to make macOS recognize the mht extension and associate it to the Firefox icon? Alternatively, how can I make macOS associate an icon to these files (other than manually changing the icon on each file in the Get Info window)?\n\nA: In the comments, you indicated that the problem files were on an external drive. Is it formatted as FAT (or NTFS)?\nThese filesystems have no concept of executable files, so the system seems to assume that everything is an executable program. Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with the file.\n\nWhy does it do this? Well, it's a permissions problem.\nTo see the permissions on a file, you can open a terminal, type ls -ld with a space after it, drag in your file, and press Return. The first part of the output will look like this:\n-rw-r--r--\nSo what does all this mean?\nr: read  w: write  x: execute\n\n    -        rwx     rwx     rwx\n    |       └─┬─┘   └─┬─┘   └─┬─┘\nadditional  user    group   world\n  info     perm.s   perm.s  perm.s\n\nTry this on some file in your home folder. You should get something like rw-r--r--. Now try something on your external drive—it's probably rwxrwxrwx.\n(External drives usually don't have a concept of ownership, so even on an HFS+-formatted drive you'll get the same set in each field. Edit: I tested this on a random file and it came back with rw-r--r--. Oops.)\n\nFixing the problem\nThe proper way\nIf the partition the file is on is formatted HFS+ (like your system disk) or any Unix filesystem (e.g. ext4, XFS), then you can use chmod. To do this, type chmod -x into a terminal, add a space, and drag in your file, just as with ls above. Hit Return, and you should be golden.\nIn fact, this is always worth a shot—it's safe to try on any type of filesystem. If it doesn't work, see below.\nThe improper way—just hiding it\nOn filesystems with no concept of executable files, chmod will silently fail and nothing will happen. You can still hide this by setting an icon. To do this, Get Info on a file (⌘I) and drag a .icns file onto the icon in the top left corner. (You can also just copy and paste the icon from something else—that's probably the way to go here. If you want a custom icon, read on.)\nSo, how do you get this mysterious .icns file?\nThe easiest way is simply to open an image in Preview, select everything (⌘A), and copy it (⌘C). Then you can just paste it into the corner icon (click to select it first).\nBut .icns images have a hidden benefit—they can display differently at different sizes. This is great for app icons, which is their main reason for existence. If you want to make your own image do this, you can do the following:\n\nSlightly off-topic: making your own icon images behave differently at different sizes\n\n\n*\n\n*Collect a set of images, with sizes of 64x64 up to 1024x1024. These are for Retina displays, you'll downsize them later. Put them in a folder named whatever.iconset.\n\n*Rename each of them to icon_<halfwidth>x<halfheight>@2x.png (for example, the 64px icon would be icon_32x32@2x.png).\n\n*Duplicate each icon, halve its size, and rename it icon_<newwidth>x<newheight>.png (for example, icon_32x32.png). This can be automated with a shell script, using the sips command (run man sips for more info on using it).\n\n\nYou'll see that if you Quick Look preview the folder, you'll see your icon, and see how it behaves at different sizes.\n\n\n*Convert it to a .icns with this command: iconutil --convert icns and drag in your iconset, as with the other commands.\n\n\n\nAssociating the file type with Firefox\nI don't know whether your process would have worked, but you'll need to make sure the system can see the change. You do this with lsregister:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister .../Firefox.app\n\nReplace .../Firefox.app with the path to Firefox, or drag it into the terminal.\n", "Q: How to use movement for classical music with Apple Music?

After I rebooted the system, it booted directly into the Recovery partition.  \nThe Macintosh HD volume shows up greyed out when I start the disk utility, but I'm able to mount it (after putting in my encryption password).  However, when I set the Startup Disk to the Macintosh HD and reboot, it still boots into the Recovery partition.

I was able to recover my system by reverting the \"Macintosh HD\" CoreStorage logical volume back into a normal physical volume (which decrypts the volume as part of the \"revert\" process).\nRecovery steps:\n1) Boot into the recovery mode and open the Utilities -> Terminal\n2) Run \"diskutil cs list\" and find the line that shows the logical volume UUID.  For example:\nLogical Volume 5ACC8C0D-005C-4693-9EC6-9F6725A42D66\n\nThe logical volume UUID in this example is 5ACC8C0D-005C-4693-9EC6-9F6725A42D66\n3) Run diskutil corestorage unlockVolume <UUID> -stdinpassphrase to unlock the volume.  When prompted for the passphrase, you need to input the disk encryption passphrase.\n4) Run diskutil corestorage revert <UUID> -stdinpassphrase to revert the CoreStorage logical volume back into a normal physical volume. \nYou can see in the photo below, that the conversion process is \"Paused\":\n\nSince we're running these commands from the recovery partition, I guess the CoreStorage volume manager isn't running by default, so this will just sit here forever in the \"Paused\" state without actually doing anything...\n5) Open a new Terminal tab and run /usr/libexec/corestoraged in this second terminal window.  The corestoraged volume manager will stay running in this second window until the volume has been completely reverted.  Just leave it for now.\n\n6) While corestoraged is running in the second window, switch back to the first terminal window and run diskutil cs list.  You should see that the conversion process has started now!  You can keep running the diskutil cs list command repeatedly to check the status.  This will probably take an hour or two to complete.\n\n7) Eventually, the conversion process will complete and the corestoraged process in the second tab will return to the terminal prompt.  If everything worked correctly, when you run diskutil cs list, you should NOT see any volumes listed.\n8) Quit Terminal\n9) Go to the Apple icon, choose \"Startup Disk\" and pick Macintosh HD.  Reboot the computer.\n10) When the mac restarts, it should boot from the Mackintosh HD instead of the recovery partition.  You should now be able to login as normal to the decrypted disk.\n", "Q: Can't copy to FAT32 MBR file size more than 2 GB For some reason I can't copy file more than 2 GB size on a FAT32 MBR USB.\nI thought the maximum file size limit is 4 GiB (exactly 4 GiB-1 Byte)  on a FAT32.\nI've reformatted the USB again with Disk Utility, FAT32 MBR.\nSame result.\ncan’t be copied because it is too large for the volume’s format.\nPlease help.

So, think of sudo as su- get another identity and then do something.  \nWithout specifying a user, it defaults to root:\nsudo foo = sudo -u root foo.  \nThis is not limited to the root user either.  User1 can issue a command as User2:  \n$ sudo -u User2 foo\nNow, Finder doesn't mount anything, Finder will call a function that mounts your device (technically, there's a \"listener\" function - automount - that waits for a device to be inserted to automatically mount it).  Finder just \"displays\" it.\nThis automounter is running with root level privileges which is required to mount anything in the /Volumes folder which is where automount will put the folder to the newly mounted device.  Users aren't allowed to modify this folder which is why you need root privileges; thus sudo\nIf you want to mount something without using sudo, mount it anywhere you have full ownership, like in your home directory (/Users/username/foo/bar).  Since you have full ownership in that directory, you won't need root privileges to mount it. \n\nA: Rather than going through the low-level process (creating the directory and then using mount), just let the OS handle the details for you:\nopen afp://pepito:thepassword@MacBook-Air.local/HD710A\n\n\nA: $ sudo mkdir /Volumes/HD710A\nPassword:\n$ ls -al /Volumes/\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x@  4 root  wheel   136 Oct 19 18:06 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  28 root  wheel  1020 Oct 15 23:51 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 root  wheel    68 Oct 19 18:06 HD710A\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel     1 Oct 19 18:03 HDD -> /\n$\n\nHERE THE CLUE!!!\n$ sudo chown pepito:staff /Volumes/HD710A\n$\n\nNow the results and mount!!!\n$ ls -al /Volumes/\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x@  4 root        wheel   136 Oct 19 18:06 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  28 root        wheel  1020 Oct 15 23:51 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x+  2 pepito      staff    68 Oct 19 18:06 HD710A\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root        wheel     1 Oct 19 18:03 HDD -> /\n$ mount -t afp afp://pepito:thepassword@MacBook-Air.local/HD710A /Volumes/HD710A\n$\n\n", "Q: Set default pdf icon with Foxit Reader On macOs High Sierra I am trying to set a default icon for .pdf files: when I used Adobe Reader all the pdf files showed its icon, then I uninstalled it and replaced it with Foxit Reader as default app to open the same file.

After the restore is done, and the iPhone says hello, then you can set up the iPhone and then restore from iCloud backup. That should help with the software problems. \nAs for the calling aspect, if it pops up again, remove and re-insert your SIM card tray into the iPhone (right hand side of the phone).

But, now with this MacBook pro I do not know what to do!\nI keep reading that in USB-C hubs/dongles, just ONE port charges the Macbook and sends video signal, the other one is just a USB-C port.\nSo, if I purchase a USB-C to Displayport cable to connect to my monitor, I won't be able to charge the MacBook at the same time, right?\nWhat can I do? \nIn summary: I need a way to connect my MacBook to my ASUS PB278Q (HDMI is ok also) and at the same time charge the MacBook and be able to have a good USB C hub (in the worst of cases.. one with a cable will do)\n\nA: From Apples's specification page, the 2017  MacBook Pro 13\" has two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports:\n\nThunderbolt 3 has several different signals embedded within it:\n\n\n*\n\n*PCIe\n\n*USB 3.1\n\n*Power\n\n*DisplayPort\n\n\nUSB-C is just the connector type not the USB specification.  In this case, the USB specification is 3.1.\nWhat you need is a USB-C Displayport cable - it's basically a DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable because the DisplayPort signals are already present (it's Thunderbolt).  You would only need an adapter if it was just a simple USB port.\nIf you get one of those hubs/dongles, it must support DisplayPort and/or power passthrough.  If you get a USB hub, then you lose the Thunderbolt functionality.  \nIf you want something that you can have a single cable setup that preserves your charging, display and USB connectivity, I suggest getting a Thunderbolt dock.  They're not cheap, but they do offer the functionality you're looking for.\n", "Q: How do I switch off/shutdown an iPhone with a broken power button? The title says it all.

Swipe up until you see the Shut Down option at bottom.Tapping on Shut Down will mimic using the power button.\nIf you're not on iOS 11: then you can use Assistive Touch: go to Settings > General > Accessibility and switch on Assistive Touch. Now you'll see a bubble appear on the screen. You can move this around, but most importantly you can tap on it and select Device and then select Lock Screen. Doing this will give you the option to switch off your iPhone. (Note: You can do this with iOS 11 as well).\nSwitching it back on\nTo switch it back on you will have to connect your iPhone to your Mac/PC or to a charger with the Lightning cable.

Apparently df is putting \"i\" after capital letters for each size. This makes sense for Kilobytes/Kibibytes, Gigabytes/Gibibytes, and Mebibytes (if that's what \"Mi\" stands for).  But why would it use \"Bi\" for bytes?\nFor example, part of my result of df -h is:\nmap auto_home           0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%       0          0  100%   /home\n\n\nA: It's the difference between the decimal value and the binary prefix.\nIn this case, it's saying you are using 0 binary bytes.\nWhat's the difference?\nUsing \"Giga\" as our example, it means 10003 of something (i.e. Gigahertz).  \nIn computers it poses an interesting problem:\nA Gigabyte is 10003 bytes.  However a byte is 8 (binary) bits.  Which means it's technically 10243 bytes.   To account for this, we use different notation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Giga is decimal (base 10)\n\n*Gibi is binary (base 2)\n\n\nThe output is telling you that it's using binary units.\nIf you want to get the output in \"human readable decimal notation\", use a capital \"H\":\n$ df -H\n/dev/disk2      1.1T   413G   706G    37% 100935848 172431606   37%   \nmap auto_home     0B     0B     0B   100%         0         0  100%   /home\n\nFinally, it's actually not an Apple convention, but one from BSD (it's a BSD command). You can find more info on the man page (man df).\n\nA: Bi means you're in units of 10240 bytes, instead of 10000 bytes.\ni.e. they're the same unit, but wouldn't be with larger prefixes that mean non-zero exponents.  It looks like df is just being pedantic, as a way to be consistent when in power-of-2 units mode.\nThis is a made-up convention: there is no metric or IEC \"Bi\" unit, only 2-letter IEC prefixes that end with \"i\", for use with quantities of bits or bytes.  (e.g. Mi for mebibytes or mebibits.)  And no, you're not expected to ever say that out loud un-ironically with a straight face.\n\"iB\" might make more sense (binary bytes with no prefix), but it's not a thing either.\n", "Q: Stop spacebar triggering quicklook when using Quicksilver If I invoke Quicksilver and type \"activity\", and then press spacebar in order to finish typing \"activity monitor\", instead of a space being included in my search string, it invokes quicklook on whatever the current target is.

I don't seen anything in the preferences. \n\nA: The default spacebar behavior was changed from “Normal” to “Smart” a couple of years ago. Users that had chosen a setting explicitly were unaffected, but if you had never picked anything, the new default took over.\nYou can change it back by going to Preferences → General → Command and looking at the Spacebar behavior setting.\nHaving said that… You should never need to type a space when searching and you should never need to type that many characters. The main feature of Quicksilver is that it lets you find things with an abbreviation that makes sense to you, and doesn’t require typing full names of things.\nTo find Activity Monitor, a m should be enough.\nI encourage you to try the Smart behavior. It’s quite a time saver. This is what it will do:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the object has children, show them (unless it's a text file)\n\n*Jump to the third pane if the current action requires it\n\n*Quick Look if the object supports it\n\n*If user is holding Shift, go to the parent (same as left arrow)\n\n*Switch to text mode\n\n*If in the second pane, select the first action that takes an argument in the third pane\n\n", "Q: How to open all Safari history at once?

I just happily discovered that .obj files are viewable in Quick Look and Preview!\n\nI'm assuming this is now standard functionality, rather than the result of some third-party software on my Mac having been bundled with a Quick Look plug-in for OBJ... since Preview appears to have added support at the same time. \nSurprisingly, web searches have not revealed much about this feature. All I've found is this GitHub page, but it's for a separate plug-in. Maybe it was released under a license that allowed Apple to make it part of macOS? Curious...\nIf it is standard, since which version of macOS has this been available? I'd like to know what to tell others when sharing .obj files with them regarding if they can expect to be able to view the data on their Macs without needing to install 3D software.\n\nA: Quicklook 3d file preview was available since Mac OS 10.5 Leopard as far as I can remember. Common 3D files like OBJ and Collada DAE works out of box for quicklook and preview, Finder too will generate a nice icon for them. Pretty neat!\n\nA: I presume it was introduced with the availability of the new Metal framework and MetalKit, ModelIO, in macOS El Capitan 10.11. It also added support for other 3D file formats like .stl or .ply. In macOS Sierra 10.12 they added .usd file support. The current formats supported are listed here:\nMDLAsset class description\n\nA: …there was a hack time ago on early os x, where simply adding a text line in a preference file (in my case .lwo) give quicklook the ability to preview 3d objects (in my case lightwave .lwo). im unable to find this hack again…\n", "Q: FaceTime calls keep disconnecting the moment I answer I've recently upgraded my MacBook Pro to macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.

Is there anything I can do to fix this issue?\n\nA: Here's a link that might shed some light on that issue. http://support.apple.com/kb/TS5419\nD.\n\nA: Turn Facetime off and then back on. Make sure it activates and then restart your device.\nAlso make sure that both of you check your Wi-Fi quality.

An Apple official article for iPhone says:\n\nWhen you use the Apple USB Power Adapter to charge iPhone, make sure the USB cable is fully inserted into the power adapter before you plug the adapter into a power outlet.\n\n(from iPhone User Guide at https://help.apple.com/)\nThis seems to hint that plugging the cable and iPhone before plugging both to the charger has some potential risk?  How so?\n\nA: Looks like basic guidelines when handling electric devices: The moment with the highest risk of anything going wrong is the moment you plug something into the power outlet (or remove it from there). So it makes a lot of sense of not having your expensive device (the iPhone) already attached to the other end. \n\nA: This seems to just indicate that there's a shock hazard if you plug the USB plug into a charger that is already connected to the wall socket, as you may touch the bare metal on the USB-A plug.\n", "Q: What does the Key icon mean when I type in a password in terminal? When I type in a password in Terminal, it sometimes displays a key icon on top of the cursor.

Is it just an indication that something is a password? I see the icon when I type read -s ASDF as well, leading me to think it just indicates a \"hidden\" input.\n\nA: It means that what you're about to type won't be printed out to the terminal — it's hidden input.

Given a file path, I need to rotate all the pages in a PDF at that file path using nothing that isn't included with macOS. The wrapper for this will be AppleScript, so I also have access to the command line and therefore all of the scripting languages installed by default with macOS, but nothing that would require brew or, for example, Python's pip.\n\nA: To my knowledge macOS does not have any one native command line Unix executable that can rotate all pages in a PDF (while keeping text based ones text based). sip can rotate a single page PDF however the resulting PDF is an encapsulated image, not text if it was text base to begin with. Also, not sure if there is a way with just plain AppleScript, other then via UI Scripting the default Preview application, without going to AppleScriptObjC (Cocoa-AppleScript) and or Python, etc.\nUsing third-party command line utilities is probably the easiest, but you said it has to be done only using what's a default part of macOS. So, I'll offer an AppleScript solution that uses UI Scripting the default Preview application, that can be used in the event there isn't another way with AppleScriptObjC or without third-party utilities, etc.\nThis solution, as offered (and coded), assumes that Preview is the default application for PDF documents and uses it to rotate all the pages in the PDF document. It is also setup as an Automator workflow. (Although there are other ways to incorporate the AppleScript code shown below.)\nFirst, in Finder, make a copy of the target PDF documents and work with those.\nIn Automator, create a new workflow document, adding the following actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Specified Finder Items\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the copied target PDF document to this action.\n\n\n*Run AppleScript Script\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the default code with the code below:\n\n\n\nAppleScript code:\non run {input}\n    set thisLong to 0.25 -- # The value of 'thisLong' is decimal seconds delay between keystrokes, adjust as necessary.\n    set theRotation to \"r\" -- # Valid values are 'l' or 'r' for Rotate Left or Rotate Right.\n    set theViewMenuCheckedList to {}\n    set theMenuItemChecked to missing value\n    repeat with thisItem in input\n        tell application \"Finder\" to open file thisItem -- # By default, in this use case, the PDF file will open in Preview.\n        delay 1 --  # Adjust as necessary. This is the only 'delay' not defined by the value of 'thisLong'.\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            perform action \"AXRaise\" of window 1 of application process \"Preview\" -- # Just to make sure 'window 1' is front-most.\n            delay thisLong\n            --  # Ascertain which of the first six 'View' menu items is checked.\n            set theViewMenuCheckedList to (value of attribute \"AXMenuItemMarkChar\" of menu items 1 thru 6 of menu 1 of menu bar item 5 of menu bar 1 of application process \"Preview\")\n            repeat with i from 1 to 6\n                if item i in theViewMenuCheckedList is not missing value then\n                    set theMenuItemChecked to i as integer\n                    exit repeat\n                end if\n            end repeat\n            --  # Process keystrokes based on which 'View' menu item is checked.\n            --  # This is being done so the subsequent keystroke ⌘A 'Select All' \n            --  # occurs on the 'Thumbnails', not the body of the document.\n            if theMenuItemChecked is not 2 then\n                repeat with thisKey in {\"2\", \"1\", \"2\"}\n                    keystroke thisKey using {option down, command down}\n                    delay thisLong\n                end repeat\n            else\n                repeat with thisKey in {\"1\", \"2\"}\n                    keystroke thisKey using {option down, command down}\n                    delay thisLong\n                end repeat\n            end if\n            repeat with thisKey in {\"a\", theRotation as text, \"s\"} -- # {Select All, Rotate Direction, Save}\n                keystroke thisKey using {command down}\n                delay thisLong\n            end repeat\n            keystroke theMenuItemChecked as text using {option down, command down} -- # Resets the 'View' menu to the original view.\n            delay thisLong\n            keystroke \"w\" using {command down} -- # Close Window.\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend run\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*As this script uses UI Scripting, when run from Automator (or Script Editor), the running app must be added to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility in order to run properly. Saved as an application, the saved application would need to be added.\n\n*Also with UI Scripting, the value of the delay commands may need to be changed for use on your system (and or additional delay commands added as appropriate, although in the case additional delay commands should not be needed). It should go without saying however test this on a set of a few document first to make sure the value set for thisLong works on your system. On my system this worked as coded.\n\n*When using UI Scripting in this manner, once the task has started, one must leave the system alone and let it finish processing the files.

Currently, I'm using the Anker Powerport+ 5 ports usb-c to charge my Macbook pro 2017 15 inches. The power delivery in the system report is 45W . Is it safe for the long run if I continue using this, the apple charger is quite big for travel.\nThanks\n\nA: Yes, it will be safe.\nWhen using lower capacity chargers the risk is primarily to the charger, not to your MacBook Pro. However, it's mainly only quite low capacity chargers (e.g. those used for some smartphones, etc) that are going to be at risk.\nIn the case of the Anker PowerPort+ 5 Ports USB-C, it's actually a 60W USB wall charger and is specifically designed to charge devices such as your MacBook. According to their product description page, it is designed to charge the MacBook at a full 29W speed-almost twice as fast as a standard USB-C charge (note that by standard they're not referring to Apple's MBP chargers).\nWhat you will find in comparison to your Apple charger is that it will charge the battery slower. How much slower will depend on a number of variables, such as whether your computer is sleeping/shutdown or whether it's actively being used. And, if it is being used, it will depend on what you're doing. If you're doing CPU intensive tasks (e.g. video editing, playing graphics intensive games, etc) then it will charge slower again.\nHowever, in a nutshell, your MBP battery will be totally fine.\nFinally, you may be interested in reading up on what Apple says about it's batteries.

I'm currently editing a font frequently and restarting apps every time is a pain. \nOne thing I noticed is that when I edit a font, and type the updated glyphs first time in hours, apps do reflect the change and display the glyphs in a new design instead of an old one without restarting. So I suspected that commands like purge, killall -KILL SystemUIServer, and killall -KILL Dock might be relevant (I run those commands a couple times a day) so I tested but they didn't work. \nI also tried \nsudo atsutil databases -remove\natsutil server -shutdown\natsutil server -ping\n\nbut it didn't have any effect either.\nOS: Mountain Lion 10.8.3\n\nA: Someone may have a better solution, but here's an explanation and potential workaround.\nThe problem you're having is that you're editing a font already loaded by your applications. In other words, while macOS has been able to dynamically add fonts to application menus since the onset of Font Book (although it often didn't work well until Mac OS X Leopard was released in 2007), it's not able to trigger the fact that the font itself has changed.\nMy best guess at a workaround is to just use Font Book to Disable the font and then to Enable it again. This should force all your open applications to register the change because the font has been enabled again.\nAs an aside, you may find this page of interest to you: Font Management in macOS and OS X.\n", "Q: I updated Sophos now I am getting these errors popping up repeatedly How can  I get rd of these pop up error messages, I have deleted the Sophos Antivirus but still I am getting these popups, where is it coming from ?\nI am using sierra OS on mac book pro 2013 edition.\n\n\n\nA: Golden Rule - don't try to just \"delete\" an antivirus, they don't like it.\nUse the Uninstaller - there is [was] one in the Applications folder.

It can divert calls from a list of numbers to voicemail.  The list it uses comes from outside the phone.\nSo it IS technically possible now, but there don't seem to be any applications that do it.

No success with both.\n\n\nExpanding the partition from the Terminal:\nI expanded the partition from the terminal, inspiring myself from this tutorial and its comments \nhttp://blog.kyodium.net/2010/11/increase-disk-and-partition-size-in.html:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switched to root user with the su command\n\n*Listed the drives with diskutil list\n\n*Unmounted the \"Macintosh HD\" partition of the original drive: diskutil unmount /dev/disk1 and cloned drive diskutil unmount /dev/disk2\n\n*Showed the partition scheme of the original drive: gpt show /dev/disk1\n\n*Deleted the partition scheme on the cloned drive: gpt destroy /dev/disk2\n\n*Created a new partition scheme on the cloned drive: gpt create -f /dev/disk2\n\n*Created again the same partitions, but with increased size for the \"Macintosh HD\" one and the Recovery partition moved 800 MB before the end of the hard drive: gpt add -b <start> -s <size> -t <GUID_from_disk1> /dev/disk2\n\n*Checked everything by repeating step 3 and using gpt show ... on both drives.\n\n*Cloned the recovery partition dd if=/dev/disk1s3 of=/dev/disk2s3\n\n*Repeated step 8.\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"Macintosh HD\" partition from the cloned drive shows with the correct size around 800 GB when externally attached to the MacBook running Lion 10.7.5.\n\n*When the hard drive is inserted into the original MacBook, the OS starts correctly and allows to login. (I had to perform some verification and minor repair of the \"Macintosh HD\" volume on the MacBook running Lion for the OS to completely load.)\n\n*The disk utily for Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitain still sees the wrong size of 160 GB for the \"Macintosh HD\" Volume and when clicking on the \"Partition\" button, the disk utility crashes. The MacBook still displays the message that the start disk is full.\n\n\nWhen creating the partitions at step 6, was it an error keeping the GUID of the original drive with the -t option?\nHere are the hard drives and partitions as seen from the terminal:\n   sh-3.2# diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *160.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Senza titolo            159.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *160.0 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            159.2 GB   disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            815.8 GB   disk2s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk2s3\n\nsh-3.2# diskutil cs list\nNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found\nsh-3.2# diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s2\nVolume Macintosh HD on disk1s2 unmounted\nsh-3.2# diskutil unmount /dev/disk2s2\nVolume Macintosh HD on disk2s2 unmounted\nsh-3.2# gpt show /dev/disk1\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  310902592      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  311312232    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  312581768          7         \n  312581775         32         Sec GPT table\n  312581807          1         Sec GPT header\nsh-3.2# gpt show /dev/disk2\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         PMBR\n           1           1         Pri GPT header\n           2          32         Pri GPT table\n          34           6         \n          40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n      409640  1593425880      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  1593835520     1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  1595105056   358420079         \n  1953525135          32         Sec GPT table\n  1953525167           1         Sec GPT header\nsh-3.2#\n\n\nA: The HFS+ volume data structures \"know\" how big the volume is; this means that if you take a 159.2 GB HFS+ volume and edit the partition table to make it 815.8 GB, you now have an inconsistent state: the partition table says its 815.8 GB, the volume data structures say it's 159.2 GB, and any tool that looks at both is going to be confused.\nTo avoid this problem, do not use gpt to change the size of partitions that contain HFS+ volumes, and don't use dd to clone between partitions or disks that aren't exactly the same size. Instead, change partition sizes with with either diskutil resizeVolume or Disk Utility (these edit both the partition table and volume data structures to keep them in sync). Also, you can clone HFS+ volumes with either something like asr --source /dev/disk1s2 --target /dev/disk2s2 --erase (note: verify /dev entry names are correct before entering this command!) or with Disk Utility's \"Restore\" tool (these both correctly handle expanding/contracting HFS+ volume data structures to match the target partition).\nAt this point, I'd erase the new drive and start over -- it's easier to use the right tools from the beginning than it is to clean up after using the wrong ones.\n", "Q: Karaoke-style lyrics in iTunes I would like to have iTunes display the lyrics while playing and auto-scroll to synchronize with the audio.  I am willing to add ID3 tags or XML or some other such thing to lyrics to support the sync, but I am not aware of a format/syntax to do so.\n“Cover Version” will display the lyrics (and any embedded codes) but no auto-scroll (and it is unsupported since Yosemite and iTunes 12.6.1)\nGet Lyrical and LessLyrics sound useful, but I would really like to do it in a visualizer in iTunes on both iPad and MacOS.  And neither (nor \"Get Lyrica\") is in the app store.\nAs I was typing this, a couple of possible duplicates appeared in the \"similar questions\" list, but just as I was about to click one, both links disappeared!\n\nA: Looks like LrcShow may do the trick. There are full usage requirements and instructions on that page, but it seems that it supports live lyric display for lyrics with bracketed timecodes before each word (.kra), before each line (.lrc), or a static display for lyrics with no timecodes (.txt).\n\nA: Accepted Tuesday’s answer before even trying it, but wanted to point out for others that if you have an Apple Music subscription, recent versions of the app formerly known as part of iTunes, lyrics from those songs can auto-scroll.

An AppleCare man told me last month that they were concerned to \"capture\" adapters that were getting too hot, and promptly sent me a new one in a box in which I was to put the problem adapter and return to them (all paid by Apple of course.)\n  My concern then was mostly with the strange sounds it was making, seeming to exactly mirror the CPU whine and activity sounds from my Macbook. Since the new one also did this, when I mentioned this at an Apple Store I was visiting the Genius offered to give me another new replacement. This one seemed silent at first, though on closer inspection in the quiet of home I found the mirroring effect was still present in the third adaptor, though a bit softer. As it happened I've ended up with a replacement Macbook because of another issue, making it four adaptors in my experience. All of them have gotten warm, and a bit hot sometimes, and all have produced the same subtle sounds of the CPU activity. I believe these sound effects result somehow as a result of the magnetic power cord connection, which sits very near the CPU. Unfortunately both my Macbooks have had the CPU whine (a high-pitched buzz) and this then gets reproduced by the adaptors.\n  So, I'd also recommend you call Apple or take it to an Apple Store for a replacement adaptor, which should not get as hot as you describe, but may indeed make some strange-seeming sounds.\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How do in-app purchases work for child accounts with Family Sharing? Our daughter has her own iPad that she uses with an Apple ID configured as a child account. Her app store purchases require authorisation from either myself or my wife. All three of us are in the same Family Sharing group.\nOur daughter has recently started playing a new game, and wanted to purchase virtual \"coins\" from within the app. As this was an in-app purchase, it required authorisation. Things went something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Daughter chose to purchase 1000 coins from within the app (cost: £0.99)\n\n*App asked for authentication via Touch ID\n\n*Daughter authenticated with Touch ID\n\n*App displayed dialog saying that the purchase needed authorisation\n\n*Dialog button was tapped to request authorisation\n\n*My wife and I both received a request to authorise the purchase\n\n*I provided my Apple ID credentials to authorise the purchase\n\n*Back on my daughter's iPad, a message indicated that the purchase had been approved\n\n*Another message then appeared indicating that something had gone wrong (I can't remember the exact wording, but it was pretty terse, something along the lines of \"An error occurred\"!)\n\n\nStupidly, figuring it was some kind of transient error, I tried a couple more times, the last time even trying to authorise the purchase directly on the iPad rather than via my phone. None of these attempts worked.\nI've since found out that there are different types of in-app purchases, and that these coins are classed as \"consumables\" and cannot be transferred to other Apple accounts in the Family Sharing group. I suspect that if I installed the game on my phone I would now have 3000 coins waiting for me, but that doesn't help my daughter.\nI have the following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should Apple allow people to authorise (ie. pay for) in-app purchases for child accounts, if those in-app purchases cannot be used by the intended recipient (the child)? At no point in the process was I warned that this would be the outcome.\n\n*Is there any possibility of a refund? Although only £2.97 out of pocket, I've still purchased something I have no intention of using on my own device. I don't even have the game installed on my own device.\n\n*If a refund is possible, who would I contact to obtain one: Apple or the app publisher?\n\n*Is there any way I can purchase the coins for my daughter's installation of the game?\nIn general I feel Family Sharing works well, but this seems like an edge case that isn't handled at all well by iOS.\n\nA: Although they're related, you've actually asked a number of questions there. I'll deal with each of these briefly:\nQuestion 1: This question is specifically off-topic. We don't answer questions like Why does Apple... or Should Apple... etc.\nQuestion 2: Yes, it is possible you could get a refund. This will usually be in the form of a credit on your account.\nQuestion 3: You need to contact Apple, not the App publisher.\nQuestion 4: I suspect you have a few options. Since you have to contact Apple, I would just ask them what the best option would be. However, one option is to change the account details on the iPad temporarily so that it's your account that's logged into the App Store. Then try to make the purchase using your account. (You may need to delete the app and redownload it using your account). Once you've got the coins, log out of the App Store with your account and log back in with your daughter's. (NOTE: If you had to delete and reinstall the app for it to be associated with your account, this does mean you'd have to log back into your account again if/when she makes future purchases). \n", "Q: Can you explain this Wi-Fi Calling dialogue? When you try to turn on Wi-Fi Calling on iPhone (Settings->Cellular->Wi-Fi Calling->Wi-Fi Calling on This iPhone, using iOS 11.0.3) you get an interesting pop-up message:\n\nEnable Wi-Fi Calling?\nWhen you join a network, the country where the network connection is made may be sent to your carrier and your cellular identity may be sent to the Wi-Fi network operator. The city may be sent to the carrier for routing short code calls. This can be changed in Settings.\n\nWhat does this mean? I was just going to turn it on to help make better calls in my house, though I guess people might use Wi-Fi calling to save on charges when traveling abroad. But why would the carrier and \"Wi-Fi network operators\" need to know each other's information? And what is this other setting they are referring to?\nFinally, another question related to this same page: The second option is \"Prefer Wi-Fi While Roaming.\" What if you want to prefer Wi-Fi even when you aren't roaming?\n\nA: You ask a number of questions which I'll try to cover. Most of these questions are answered officially in Settings, Cellular, Wi-Fi Calling, About Wi-Fi Calling & Privacy. Note that arrangements vary by country and carrier so you'll have to check there for the exact details (for example, some countries have emergency call location requirements). However, here's a brief summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your current country is sent to the carrier. This is because some carriers do not allow out-of-country Wi-Fi calling due to regulatory reasons, and because they want to charge you roaming fees. It is also necessary in routing emergency calls.\n\n*Your cellular identity is sent to the Wi-Fi network operator. This is because some Wi-Fi network operators allow you to authenticate to hotspots via your cellular subscription (EAP-SIM is the protocol name), and will charge differently/free for Wi-Fi calls or cellular subscribers.\n\n*The \"other setting\" is in Settings, Privacy, Location Services, System Services, Wi-Fi Calling.\n\n*The last question about preferring Wi-Fi is carrier dependent. The carrier sets the threshold of signal where it wants to use Wi-Fi or cellular. When my carrier initially introduced the feature, it only used Wi-Fi when the cellular signal was weak, whereas another carrier had Wi-Fi calling for years set theirs to always prefer. At some point my carrier changed it so it always prefers Wi-Fi over cellular, likely as they became sure they had adequate capacity.\n", "Q: Can't remove warning about removing files from iCloud desktop The option, \"show warning before removing from iCloud Drive\" option is missing from the Finder preferences menu.

If I'm not mistaken, the feature was added in Sierra. \n", "Q: Keychain Access error when creating new system certificate I am following the instructions to codesign gdb on my MBP however when I get to the end of the System certificate creation process, keychain says \"Unknown Error = -2,147,414,007\" and the certificate has not been created.\nIt creates a certificate fine for login location, but system fails.\nWhat is the problem and how can I fix this?\n\nA: I got the same error, so I went through the process but created the certificate in the login keychain. Once this is done you can drag the certificate into the System keychain through the UI.\nYou will need to unlock your System keychain first if it is showing as a locked padlock: just right-click and select 'Unlock keychain \"System\"'.\nYou have to enter your password several times but eventually it works, and the corresponding codesign command works:\ncodesign -fs your-cert-name $(which gdb)\n\n\nA: Some of the tutorials I've been walking through outlining this process (& for me, uploading to TestFlight ex: Ray Wenderlich) specify to leave the CA email blank. The hint text states it's required, but I was ignoring this as the tutorials stated. By just adding the email address of the certificate authority (my admin account registered to itunes connect), I was able to download the certificate. \n", "Q: Route FaceTime notification sounds through internal/non-hdmi speaker I'm setting up an old Mac Mini as a home theater machine. We'll use it for, among other things, letting the kids FaceTime with Grandma on the big screen. \nHere's my question. I want most audio played through the TV via the hdmi connection. But... can I set things up so FaceTime notification (when Grandma calls) and only the FaceTime notifications will play through the a different speaker, so we can hear when Grandma calls even if the TV is off? Or, failing that, notification sounds in general will play through the alternate speaker but application sounds play through the TV as expected?\n\nA: Sure! Although only for all sound effects, as far as I know. Just go to the Sound pane in System Preferences, and switch \"Play sound effects through\" to your other output device.\n\n", "Q: How to fix git path after MacOS Sierra update?

Try xcode-select -p to print where the system thinks it is, and xcode-select -s /path/to/Xcode.app to tell the system where it is. (Git is stored inside Xcode.)\n\nA: In recent MacOS updates the git path is : \n/usr/local/Cellar/git/2.16.2/bin/git\n\nInstead of 2.16.2 Choose your version\n", "Q: Tracking Sleep with the new watch Is there built in functionality for the Watch 3 to track my sleep patterns?  Is there anything that figures out sleep cycles and duration, and tracks heart rate at the same time for a prelimnary analysis?\n\nA: The Apple Watch doesn't currently have built-in sleep tracking functionality. However, there are some excellent third-party apps that can track your sleep. Sleep++ is one of the more popular options, and it's free. However, Sleep++ doesn't track heart rate itself, instead leaving you to use the Apple Health app's built-in heart rate tracker. Another great choice is Sleep Diary, which does track heart rate, and seems to have a wealth of features.\nThis is just from some quick research - I don't personally do any sleep tracking with my Apple Watch, as I charge it overnight.\n", "Q: How to disable WIFI extender in Airport Express but leave ethernet working? I am using an Airport Express as an extender for the purposes of using its ethernet cable for a network device. In this setup, The Airport Express also the behavior of extending my network from my Airport Extreme. However this is causing me problems with our Apple TV since the Airport Express WIFI spec is much slower than the Airport Extreme. \nWe don't need to extend the wireless network. Is there a way to turn off wireless extension and leave the ethernet connected?\n\nA: Yes you can do this in Airport Utility. Unfortunately I don’t have it open in front of me so I can’t show you a screenshot of where in the settings to do it but if you were able to configure it  in the first place then just go back to the same place and there should be an option to disable wireless entirely. \nIf you have an older Airport Express then you’ll need Airport Utility 5.6 running on an older version of OS X. If you don’t have that handy, you’ll have to make it happen by installing an older version of OS X in a virtual machine.\nHope this helps. \n\nA: Possibly.\nYou can always run a wire from one AP to another and turn off WiFi entirely on Airport (express or extreme or time capsule). They then work as switches and AirPlay and backup devices. Just set them in \"Bridge Mode\" and connect the wires.\nThere's no provision for multiple WiFi networks to have wireless backhaul and bridging, though. You'd need other access points for that. Even those newer mesh AP work best when you wire the backhaul using copper / ethernet / power line carrier / whatever.\n\nA: I encountered bugs while doing this, but I did eventually arrive at a solution.\n\n*\n\n*Ensure bridging mode is enabled under the network tab.\n\n*Under the wireless tab, set it to off.\n\nYou may encounter an error doing this, if the settings don't apply correctly, this gets a bit weird:\n\n*\n\n*Configure it to \"join a wireless network\".  Once the settings are applied, this may cause some issues with your network if the cable is in, so after this point disconnect the cable.\n\n*in the settings again, ensure bridging is enabled, and then set the wireless network mode to off.\n\n*Plug the ethernet back in to the input port.\n\nWhen I did this the wifi from the airport was disabled and it correctly picked up an ip address from the attached network cable only.  The airport device was available for use.\n\nA: Yes this can be done, but the tools necessary to do this are buggy.\nI am using the Windows Version of Airport Utility, and perhaps the Mac version is not the same, but these steps likely work for both.\nOnce you turn off the Wi-Fi in the airport express, you can no longer discover or reprogram the AirPort Express on the network with the AirPort utility, even if it is working perfectly.\nSo the methodology is to set the AirPort Express up like you are creating a new wireless network connected to the network. I used a different name for that new AirPort Express wireless network than my main wireless network for testing purposes. As you create this network, make sure that ultimately the connection sharing (found under the internet tab is off (bridge mode))\nYou can test this network by joining it wirelessly and making sure that it is seen by airplay and is working well. Once you have done all the testing you want, you are ready to turn off the wireless transmitter.\nYou do this by going to the internet tab in the airport utility, and you change the wireless mode to off.\nWhen you update in the AirPort utility, you will no longer be able to scan and find that base station using the AirPort Utility, but it will actually have programmed the WiFi off and the Ethernet will still transmit the signal to the AirPort Express.  The ITunes speaker name that you set up earlier when it was wireless will be displayed in the Airplay device, and can be accessed like all other airplay devices.\nOddly, the iOS Airport utility will tell you that all is working, and the green light will be solid, but the Windows AirPort utility will no longer find that base station to reprogram.\nAs an aside the iOS AirPort Utility seems to communicate with the base station, but when I turned back on the wireless signal, I could not communicate with the base station.  At that point I had to do a hard reset and start over.\n", "Q: Azuon with Wineskin on MacOS 10.13? This question concerns a travel tool, but it may find some knowledge here.\ntl;dr - Anyone using Azuon on the latest MacOS?\nFor more than a year, I have been using the Windows app Azuon on MacOS using Wineskin.  They have complicated porting instructions in a video, but when I first got it, they had an already wrapped executable.  This executable successfully updated itself several times, and when it failed (once), the MSI was successful in installing the new one.\nBut I updated MacOS to 10.13, and the wrapped app will not launch.  Wineskin/Winery still run, but will not run the Azuon MSI to install.\nI suspect that the much older video instructions will not work, but if I can't find someone who has succeeded, I guess I'll have to try them.\nUPDATE: In response to comments, I disabled Gatekeeper.

But I recently discovered that the DMG files from Paragon are provided for free on Seagate site here as well:\nhttps://www.seagate.com/in/en/support/software/paragon/\nHas anyone used Paragon Driver from Seagate's site and can I use it safely? I'd like to make sure that this Driver works properly before actually using it. On one hand Paragon charges almost 20 USD for it and on the other hand, Seagate offers it for free.\n\nA: The NTFS drivers provided by Seagate are OEM versions of Paragon's NTFS for Mac 14/15.\nThey share the same code base but work with Seagate's external (and probably internal, if you replaced the original Apple HDD - not tested) drives only.\nBy buying an external Seagate drive you already paid for it in the price category of dimes.\n", "Q: How can I backup/restore an app (not just it's data) in iOS 10? One of my apps got a big update with some mixed reviews, I'm interested in trying the new version, but won't do it if I can't roll back. For pre-iOS 9 systems, I heard you can backup ipa file from iTunes on PC, update the app on iPhone, and then if needed, overvrite back from iTunes and sync. But it doesn't work now - there's no ipa file for that app after iTunes sync.\nWhat are my options? I've heard about programs like iMazing, but have a feeling that for iOS 10 it will just restore the app data and not the whole app version.\n\nA: Do an iCloud backup. iCloud backups are snapshots of the phone as it is. So you'll keep the old update and its data with an iCloud backup.\nDo 1 right now and the other after the update.\nAfter your testing, then you can over write that latest backup if need be based on your choice.\n\nA: We periodically switch between Xcode versions. What we do for Xcode is drop to the command line and tar up /Applications/Xcode.app\nSometimes, we'll rename Xcode.app to be a different name (e.g. Xcode_8.3.3.app) and have multiple versions installed at once.\nThis has worked for us for Xcode.

How do I make it so that squirrel is always selected? Ideally, I could even remove Australian, but for some reason, I am prevented from removing all the inbuilt English input methods.\n\n\nA: I don't use Squirrel, so this answer may not necessarily apply.\nOnce you've added Squirrel as an Input Source in your Keyboard System Preferences (as you've already done), you should be able to make this the default in your Language and Region System Preferences.\nMore specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Select Language & Region\n\n*Click + button at bottom left\n\n*Choose the appropriate language\n\n*When prompted set this to be your primary language\n\n*You may still be prompted to add an input source in your Keyboard preferences, if so just redo that as well (i.e. add Squirrel)\n\n*You may also need to restart your Mac\n\n", "Q: Does uninstalling and installing a MacOS App Store App do anything? I have some issue with a Mac OS application that I got from the App Store. The support suggested to uninstall the app and install it again.  My question is: Is there any way this can help? \nThere is a separation of programs and user data in MacOS, so uninstalling the program and reinstalling it should be no-op in total. Is it?\n\nA: It should be. It won't delete any of your documents, but you might want to back up these locations, if they exist:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.whatever.appname.plist\n\n*~/Library/Application Support/AppName\nYou almost certainly don't need to do this--I don't know what exactly the App Store uninstall process does--but it doesn't hurt to be safe.\nUpdate: Due to sandboxing, you won't find anything in either of these locations. (All apps from the App Store are sandboxed, but apps you get somewhere else probably aren't.) You should look here instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Containers/com.whatever.appname\n", "Q: Count number of text occurrences in column using Numbers I am using Numbers to track data.

I'm trying to use Gboard dictation on my iPhone 6s+ running iOS 9.3.3.\nDictation pops up when I long-press on the spacebar and it takes dictation BUT - once it decides to switch back to the requesting app - either by timing out or my pressing on the color bars - the colored dots spin forever. \nIf I switch manually to the other app the text is there.\nAnyone know what's going on here? Can anyone else repro it? Is it unique to iOS 9.3.3?\nI'm dev-knowledgable but not for iOS. Any tips on debugging this? Wish I could get a stack trace and know what system call Gboard is hanging on.\n\nA: Xcode has a visual profiler and debugger called instruments. Once you r device with your Mac, you might be able to snoop on the error logs, system calls and such. You will be at the mercy of however much symbols and logging google enables. \nBetter might be to seek support from the vendor of the app if Xcode is either not an option or not helpful once you try it. \nN-2 iOS version support might be scant from google, but it’s only your time to try and get support from them. \n", "Q: Turn on iCloud Photo Library without creating duplicates or zombies I turned on Photo Library on my iPhone and uploaded everything, now I want to enable on my Mac. Is it going to duplicate all the photos that I've already uploaded from my iPhone to the Mac?\nWhat about photos that I deleted on my iPhone because I don't want them anymore, but they were already saved on my Mac? Is there any way to make sure those are not uploaded to iCloud from my Mac?\n\nMore details: I have been using Photos on iOS and Mac for years, and now I want to use iCloud Photo Library to reduce iPhone storage space and still have access to my entire library\nI had Photo Stream enabled, but since that doesn't support Live Photos or Videos I would periodically manually upload by plugging my iPhone in to my Mac.\nSo I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Photos on my Mac only, not taken on an iPhone\n\n*Photos and videos on both Mac and iPhone\n\n*Photos uploaded from iPhone to Mac that have since been deleted only from iPhone (don't want these)\n\n\nAny ideas? Thanks.\n\nA: In theory, it will detect all the duplicates on your Mac and not upload them. I suspect, but don’t actually know, that a photo on your Mac that you’ve previously deleted from iCloud Photo Library by deleting from your iPhone is going to get uploaded again. One thing you might want to do is create some albums on your iPhone and your Mac that you can use to look at what happened. For example, if one album has all your Mac photos in it while another has all your iPhone photos in it, after the upload completes, you can create an intelligent album of all the photos that were on the Mac but not on the iPhone during the time period that you took your iPhone photos. Those are likely to be the ones you deleted. Photos in Recently Deleted might get picked up as already deleted. Or maybe the engineers were super clever and have a checksum log of every deletion ever made. \nAlso, when you enable iPL on the Mac, iCloud is going to want you to have sufficienct space available to add every photo on the Mac (since it doesn’t know about dups yet) so you may need to increase the amount of space you are buying. You can reduce your plan after it’s completed if you don’t actually need the space.\nThe reconciliation can be a long process (days or even weeks) depending on the size of your library, the speed of your Mac, and the speed of your connection. It doesn’t actually upload duplicates, it just does some kind of a checksum comparison to detect them.\n", "Q: APFS Errors: fsck can't repair TL;DR\nAsked the same question on Apple communities, nothing useful.\nFind the post here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8123614\nbash-3.2# fsck_apfs -d -l /dev/disk5\nfletcher64_init:58: Selecting AVX2 implementation of fletcher64\n** Checking volume.\n** Checking the container superblock.\n** Checking the EFI jumpstart record.\n** Checking the space manager.\n** Checking the object map.\n** Checking the APFS volume superblock.\nwarning: apfs_sb at apfs_fs_index (0): apfs_features has unrecognized features (2)\n** Checking the object map.\n** Checking the fsroot tree.\nerror: btn: key (2) compare error: 22\n   fsroot tree is invalid.\n** The volume /dev/disk5 could not be verified completely.\n\nHardware iMac (27-inch, Late 2013), 256GB stock SSD, nothing special, nothing fancy. \nStandard issue hardware and I am certain that this hardware is flawless- since I run Linux/Freebsd on it. \nDrive is a default single partitioned GPT for fresh install of High Sierra. I simply erased the whole drive, set a new GPT scheme, formatted it as HFS+ and started the installer from USB. This went ok, but after a few days I checked the Volume after power outage and found that I can't repair it anymore... \nDisk Utility.app says the same what fsck does. Disk Utility is basically executing fsck in the background anyways, if you think it's not then start Disk Utility directly through Terminal and you will see it in stdout.\nI couldn't find any useful documentation, just some marketing flavoured mambo-jumbo without any technical depth.\nI installed the 10.13.1 Public Beta release with hopes that maybe it will recognize the unrecognized features, now it says more or less the same and still can't repair the volume - although it does not complain about unrecognized features.\nI read somewhere that APFS is close related to ZFS, so maybe one can work with ZFS tools or other software that explicitly is designed to repair APFS similar to a back story here: http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/2016/06/15/apple_and_zfs/\nSub-topics\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to opt-out of APFS on SSD? \n\n*Is there a way to convert back to HFS+\n\n\nDuring installation the installer didn't asked about conversion (or maybe I missed it) and now im stuck with a drive I can't use.\n\nUpdate II:\nAfter reading a bit about ZFS and then references from Wikipedia entry about APFS (correct me if I am wrong) APFS implementation should take care off any faults on it's own, and, theoretically there is no need for a fsck command. Well, thinking of it, I never had to fsck a BTRFS volume either, if there were some issues there were scrubbed at boot time, guess this is how APFS is supposed to work as well - since fault tolerance is one of it's core features.\nMore technical details by reverse engineering APFS are here \nUpdate III (07.01.2018)\nAfter some weeks of APFs testing on native Apple and non-Apple hardware by doing a lot of common and some not so-common testing - I recommend to stay away from it until the Linux kernel is able to mount an APFS volume in R/W mode. From my experience one can expect to have a really bad day if your APFS based storage crashes for some reason and won't be able to self-heal. In most cases it does the job and can repair itself - however in 8 weeks I landed in more then 5 cases where it couldn't- despite no hardware failure. I was not able to repair/reuse the volume without reformatting therefore I'm not using APFS until it's well documented and mountable in Linux in R/W mode for anything else then system files.\nSSD vs. non-SSD\nIf you are running APFS on non-SSD: it will be slower then HFS. Period.\nAPFS is (currently) only reasonable on internal SSD drives and on can be on  hybrid drives (although Apple installer won't agree). Magnetic hard drives don't benefit from APFS in any way. External SSD drive performance is not really comparable since the amount data you can squeeze through USB-C is limited and HFS+ wont't be a bottleneck.\n\nA: Same advice as the Apple forums. Backup and reformat your system.\nApple has not released an APFS specification or code yet. As you have found, only very rough reverse engineering has been done. Trying to interpret what key 2 miscompare in the fsroot tree is pure speculation at this point.\nThere is no way to convert back to HFS+. There is an unofficial way to opt out though.\nThere is no need for a fsck command means that the FS will try to fix anything wrong on-the-fly, online. No filesystem can be immune from all potential damage or implementation bugs. If something can't be fixed by fsck offline, then there really is no chance to have it fixed online.\nHowever, one potential scenario is a bug with fsck and not the system code, but again that's pure speculation without being able to understand what's wrong. It's your choice, but a reformat is the safest point.\n\nA: Try checking your RAM.\nI had a similar issue with 10.13 (High Sierra) on a 2017 iMac (18,3) with a factory SSD and 3rd party RAM. I got repeated freezes, and Disk Utility First Aid reported errors like \"Object map is invalid\" and concludes \"File system verify or repair failed\". Each time, I would reformat the SSD and reinstall macOS and software, but the problem would return after a few days. It passed Apple Diagnostics, and my local Apple Store was unable to detect any hardware problems (after I removed the 3rd party RAM).  I have had no problems on multiple other computers, including 2 other iMacs, a MacBook and several macOS virtual machines.\nWhat fixed it for me was to match RAM by bank, i.e. Bank 0 (DIMM 0/1) contains a matched pair of Apple RAM, and Bank 1 (DIMM 0/1) contains a matched pair of 3rd party RAM.\nUpdate 2018-01-06: Just got another failure after 1 week. (This is the trouble with random failures).  I have temporarily removed the 3rd party RAM while I do more testing.\nUpdate 2018-01-22: After 10 days with new RAM, the problem has not occurred. I believe my problem was caused by bad RAM. (Maybe APFS uses RAM as a cache?).\n\nA: I was able to recover files after I created a disk image from the corrupted APFS partition and it can be mounted.\n", "Q: Time Machine backup constantly transferring 30gb+ I have mac book pro mid 2015 with high sierra.  I backup to time capsule network drive.  Initial backs ups transferred like this.\nday 1 250gb\nday 2 80gb\nday 3 60gb\nIt would then do small backups regularly with no issues, which corelates with my daily usage but on day 15, it started transferring 30gb+ again.  So whenever I do have laptop open, it never completes transfer or backup. Latest complete backup is maybe a week ago.  \nI use the laptop every day, but apart from a few music album downloads, I'm not a heavy downloader.\nMy total space used is currently 257gb (500gb total).  Only thing I can think might cause it to act up, is I have some VMs on my machine that might cause it to think it needs to transfer those images constantly.  I have google drive, and icloud for offline backups. \nEdit: How can I stop this from happening, and create a backup.\n\nA: I  use the application BackupLoupe to examine my Time Machine Backups. This enables me to see what is in each backup and then set exclusions as appropriate to meet my needs.\nThe biggest exclusion is the folder my virtual machines are stored in. I never allow Time Machine to backup my VM's.\nSystem Preferences > Time Machine > Options... > Exclude these items from backups:\nNote: I have no affiliation with soma-zone the developer of BackupLoupe.\n\nA: Virtual Machines are a special kind.  If you are not careful, they are put in a single file on the file system so any single bit written inside it will cause the whole file to have to be backed up again.  I would guess this is what you see.\nYou can either tell Time Machine not to back up your virtual machines at all, or create a sparse disk image (which consists of a large number of individual parts) where you can move your virtual machine files to.  Then MacOS only needs to back up the parts that changed which I used for a while giving a reasonable compromise.\nSee https://blog.fosketts.net/2015/07/22/how-to-use-mac-os-x-sparse-bundle-disk-images/ for instructions.\n", "Q: 15 Pin Joystick (old style PC) to USB solution for OS X I have a set of old Thrustmaster TCS joysticks.

I have seen some DB-15 pin to USB Joystick Adapters, but I have not seen a single one that indicate OS X compatibility.  Has anyone found anything like this that works with OS X?\n\nA: As long as it is the standard USB joystick interface, those adapters should work with macOS just fine.\nYou can use programs such as USB Overdrive, Joystick Mapper or GamePad Companion to map the buttons and axes to match your game and joystick.\n", "Q: How fix fonts on external tv look good view? i have a little problem with my mac and external tv (LG 4K). \nMacbook air 2012 (intel HD 4000)\nLG 43UJ6307\ni connect macbook with MiniDisplayPort -> DVI -> HDMI (1.4). by default i cannot set resolution to 2560x1440 (max resolut. is fullHD) but i fix it by switchResX app (but this only app can change this resolution more than fHD). when i set resolution to 2k fonts are vert uggly and readble. when i connect my Desktop pc and resolution to same size fonts are pretty and more understandable.

This should give you the least amount of problems connecting to the TV. Ensure that the cable specifically supports 4k.\nI have seen multiple times that even cables sold as HDMI 1.4 cables do not really support 4k with the Mac (I guess some companies deliberately re-label old cables). Specifically I have seen this also with expensive cables, where as a cheap HDMI cable from IKEA works without any problems.\n", "Q: Best way to sync file between iphone and mac I have recently moved from Android to iPhone 7 plus 128 GB and I thought to use this space by transferring files from my Mac to iPhone.\nHowever, I don't know how I dod it. It was easier for Android, just plug the phone and drag-drop.\nThis may seem like a stupid question but any help is appreciated. I just want to transfer my music files and PDFs (ebooks, other documents).\n\nA: I would encourage you to adopt iCloud sync unless you can’t allow these files to have their “truth” copy be stored online.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/icloud/\nIn the past - the cloud sync had some cases where it wouldn’t work for very common situations, but now those reservations are all edge cases in my eyes.\nYou can use your documents folder / desktop folder and expect everything to sync up to the cloud. This includes finder color metadata, smart tags, as well as content and normal metadata (last opened, created, size, etc...)\nOn iOS - the files app is somewhat basic, but I expect it to iterate rapidly as people decide how to use it and Apple adapts the layout and training so people can use the tools.\nThe underlying sync seems quite solid in my experience the last 2 years with improvements made each month along the way. I have about 120 GB of files stored and am delighted with the performance now that I have an always-on Mac Mini running iCloud content caching on my home and work networks. Restores of 128 GB to a full iPhone that used to take day(s) now takes hour(s) with most of the restore functional after 60 minutes. You don’t need caching, but it’s there for power users or people with slower network access speeds or worried about restores pushing them over a data usage limit.\n\nA: The traditional way of transferring those files is to use iTunes on your Mac.\nAdd the music and ebooks to your iTunes library and then select them to be synced to your iPhone. Apple's support article on the topic has the details: Sync your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iTunes on your computer using USB.\nYou can also use other transports such as for example storing your ebooks and PDFs on iCloud Drive, DropBox or similar - and then accessing them from the iPhone via the cloud.\nOr you could use AirDrop to transfer PDFs to your iPhone and open them in iBooks.\n\nA: using an original apple cable when iphone is plugged in your mac on itune appear an iphone icon, selecting it by accessing your iphone management\n", "Q: I downloaded macOS 10.13.1 Beta 2 two times but it isn't installing Last night, I wanted to upgrade my system, so I downloaded macOS 10.13.1 Beta 2, but after downloading 2 GB files, it didn't do anything. I waited 10 mins but it was still the same, on App Store it just says \"Update\". \nSo I downloaded it again with press Update button, and it downloaded 2 GB again. But still it is just saying \"Update\". It didn't restart, didn't open the installer or anything. \nWhat should I do?\n\nA: In this case, the updater downloads to your Applications folder.  There you will see an icon there that you can click on to update.\nYou can use Launchpad to see the icon, or go directly to your Applications folder.\n\n\nA: This happens even releases for general use due to corrupt downloads, bad file on the server, date/time/signing errors. Especially when the Mac App Store does the download instead of a web browser or other more explicit file download tool. \nSince this is a beta update, I'd check within your beta channel support community to see if others are having this issue.  Not only is the code being tested, the software infrastructure to deliver the update could be beta / testing, too. This redo / uncertainty / breakage is big part (perhaps the overriding reason for existence) of participating in beta software evaluation.\n", "Q: Permanently enable to show hidden/system files when searching in Finder I've been searching for a lot of hidden/system files through the Finder recently and it's really annoying to activate the display of those system files manually each time (Tutorial for this here).

I agree with the others that a folder action is the best way to handle it, but if you really want to do it without, you can create a stay open application that queries the contents of the folder and compares it to the last time it ran, and displays the different files. Change the runInterval property to run at your preferred frequency.\nNote: For simplicity, I only wrote it to check for files added to the spool folder. You can tweak it to also check for removed files by duplicating the second section in the code below, and looping through spoolFiles and seeing if they are in currentFiles.\nAppleScript Code, as a stay-open application, below:\nproperty spoolFiles : {}\nproperty currentFiles : {}\nproperty runInterval : 5 -- interval is in seconds\nglobal folderSpool\n\non idle\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set folderSpool to folder \"Spool\" of desktop\n        if (count of spoolFiles) is 0 then set spoolFiles to name of every file of folderSpool\n        set currentFiles to name of every file of folderSpool\n    end tell\n\n    set changedFiles to {}--Reverse and repeat this section to check for missing files\n    repeat with i from 1 to count of currentFiles\n        if currentFiles's item i is not in spoolFiles then\n            set changedFiles's end to currentFiles's item i\n        end if\n    end repeat\n\n    repeat with each_file in changedFiles\n        set theDialogText to \"File is: \" & (each_file) & \".\"\n        display dialog theDialogText\n    end repeat\n    set spoolFiles to currentFiles --important to update the spoolFiles so only new files will get displayed going forward.\n    return runInterval\nend idle\n\n", "Q: Why does Users & Groups System Preference not display a user? There's a user from whom I inherited my work Mac who is listed under the /Users directory, however, this user doesn't appear in the Users & Groups system preference. I am an admin on the Mac so I don't think that it's a permissions issue. Does anybody know why this may be happening?\nFYI: My ultimate goal is to delete this user to free up disk space.\n\nA: Most likely, the user was deleted, but the user's home folder was retained (See the option Don't change the home folder below).\nIt can be deleted if you don't need it.

For example, am I guaranteed once 100APPLE is full, it will never change?\nI am manually backing up the folders and this would make my life easier. Also when moving to a new iPhone, it means I can continue to only back up the new folders.\n\nA: No, I don’t think you can count on that being guaranteed. \nYes, chronological filling first is typical and unless someone messes with the storage or counters / settings you’re pretty save with that assumption/generalization. \nFor my sanity, I grab all the images and process later if I feel I can’t just store all the images from each device.

It happens during the stage where iTunes displays Extracting software...\nAfter it's very quick reboot (It only flashes the white screen, and darkened Apple logo for a split second), it returns to the iTunes logo with and arrow and lightning charger below it. The problem is that iTunes then looses connection with the device and when it comes to actually restoring it - It fails.\nIt would be fantastic if anyone could help me with this.\nAs a note, I am using MacOS Sierra on a MacBook Pro (13 inch, Mid-2010) and iTunes is the latest version currently available to my device.\n\nA: Please try by another USB connector.\n", "Q: Is it OK to use an HFS+ start disk with High Sierra? I have a clone of my internal SSD on an HFS+ partition of an external drive. I was wondering if there are issues with using such a disk as a startup disk with High Sierra.\n\nA: Yes - High Sierra fully supports running / booting from HFS+ since it doesn’t even change any system over to APFS except for Apple SSD based systems. Fusion drives and spinning HDD hard drives all remain on HFS+ as do all external drives connected to your High Sierra system.\n", "Q: continuity not working except for receiving calls, iMessages and AirDrop for some reason the universal clipboard and handoff between apps stopped working but AirDrops, receiving and making calls on my Mac and iMessages continue to work perfectly.\nI contacted Apple Support and we went through resetting the bluetooth adapter but it didn't work.

The OS versions are the latest. It might have stopped working after upgrading to High Sierra but I'm not sure about it.\nThanks.\n\nA: This is so hard to troubleshoot - I wish I had some good tips.

But, you might lose any apps that aren’t available for re-download or downloaded on iTunes (if you have older apps that aren’t for sale anymore). Also, that three step process takes a lot of time for devices with 60 GB of iCloud content or more.\nSorry for the “non-answer” answer but I wanted to explain there is no good consumer level debugging or logs that are publicly documented to get at the root of what’s happening with continuity.\n", "Q: Prepare MacBook for sale when OS X Lion reinstall requires Apple ID I'm going to sell my Macbook Pro.\nWhen I reinstall OS X Lion, I have to enter my own Apple ID.

The battery level indicator at that point said the remaining charge was 21%. Restarting the phone in the morning, the battery level indicator said 11%. Does turning off and starting it several hours later normally require 10% of battery?\nEDIT: the phone was completely powered off. Hold down the right-side button and slide to power off. It was in that state for at 10 hours. I wouldn't expect any power usage in such a state.\n\nA: One user's experience can differ from another for a range of factors (e.g. the age of your iPhone 6s battery, the number of charge cycles it's had, etc), so what is normal for you may not be normal for someone else.\nAn iPhone will typically use some percentage of battery over night, but how much will depend on whether it's fully shut down or just in Airplane Mode (your question doesn't really specify). If it's only in Airplane Mode, then the iPhone is not actually switched off and a number of sensors etc are still fully operational and therefore require some power.\nAlso, it's not clear from your question what you mean by several hours, but I think a 10% discharge over 6-8hrs is not uncommon.\nYou can find a lot more info by reading what Apple has to say about it's batteries.\n", "Q: How to fix \"macOS needs to repair your library to run applications\" after High Sierra upgrade?

However, when using an HDMI cable, there is a connection problem and both the Mac and the monitor flash black repeatedly trying and failing to connect. Eventually the monitor will connect but this could take 5 minutes one day and 20 minutes the next. A Dell laptop connects instantly though, so I suspect it's a problem with my MacBook.\nI talked with HP and they said it might be a resolution issue. Has anyone had this problem and were able to fix it by changing some resolution settings? Or anyone have an idea of what I can try to fix the connection issue? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: I agree with HP - an incompatible resolution could certainly cause this problem, although it could be something else.\nThe recommended resolution for the HP Pavilion 22cwa 21.5-inch IPS LED Backlit Monitor you purchased is 1920 x 1080 pixels, so you could certainly play around with your settings in Apple > System Preferences > Displays to see what impact they have.\nThe other thing you can check are the various settings on the monitor itself by pressing the Menu button to access the On-Screen Display (OSD).

Unless you are ready to pay for it, it might be better to stick on your current configuration.\n\nA: This product worked well for me:\nhttps://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt-3-dock\nIt is the OWC Thunderbolt 3 dock. It connects via 1 Thunderbolt 3 cable to your MacBook Pro while allowing you to conncect your mini-display port, ethernet and USB cables. It even charges the MacBook Pro (though only at 60W).\nYou can buy longer Thunderbolt 3 cables for it which will allow you to hide it underneath the desk.\n\nA: You can't daisy-chain USB-C, so your best bet is get a USB-C extension cable. Also, you'll need 2 of them since 1 does not provide enough bandwidth for your 2 displays.\n", "Q: Non-native full screen in Terminal.app If you press Cmd+Enter on iTerm while having the preference \"Use native fullscreen windows\" turned off, it goes into fullscreen but not the standard MacOS-way.\nIs there a way of doing the same in Terminal.app? I know I can use Ctrl+Cmd+F to enter a native full screen. And I know I can maximize the window manually to eventually consume all of the screen, but in this case the title is still visible.\n\nA: No, there's no support for this in Terminal.app.\n\nA: Option 1\nThere is an incredibly simply answer to your problem:\nDouble-click the title bar of the window.\nDouble-clicking the window again will return it to the previous size and position.  \nNote: Make sure that \"Double-click a window's title bar to zoom\" is set under System Preferences -> Dock. \n\nOption 2\nAdd a system-wide keyboard shortcut. for the Zoom action.\n", "Q: Publishing app under a different name from that of credit card I've recently completed a simple game, then I found out I need to be at least 18... No worries, you can let someone older publish it for you! Then how would anyone know it was ME who created it? Can my publisher register an apple ID with MY legal name but using their credit card / bank account and birthdate? Or can I use a different name (my name) when publishing it? Or can I at the very least write my name inside the game? \n\nA: Create a business entity, say \"T.Miller Apps LLC\" and publish under that. It will require legwork with forms and such.\nThere is no charge to transfer your membership but you will need to work with Developer support once you have established your LLC and gotten a D&B number.\nI would expect 3 months of paperwork / emails and about $150 of legal filing fees to establish a US LLC properly with the correct registrations for Apple to accept it as a company. If you're handy with paperwork or can do all of it yourself, you might cut half the time and cost off.\nChoosing which location to register will affect your costs and taxes so you might want to research that before transferring your program to an LLC.\n\nA: The publisher name needs to be correct in order to protect consumers. If Apple requires the publisher to be at least 18 years old, then you cannot write your name here, if you're not 18 yet.\nYou can however write your own name inside the game in a credits section or similar.\n", "Q: How can I change the URL of a networked Time Machine backup The network configuration in my house has changed (new router), so my Linux server (where my networked Time Machine folder is housed) has changed.\ntmutil destinationinfo yields:\n> ==================================================\nName          : 500GB External\nKind          : Local\nID            : DF1F27B7-137D-4AE1-9BAE-CD4B603B74FC\n====================================================\nName          : TimeMachine\nKind          : Network\nURL           : afp://tmuser@192.168.0.12/TimeMachine\nMount Point   : /Volumes/TimeMachine-1\nID            : 2F2F2AC7-C4E5-4F2A-9E7F-8642D6BB441B\n\nHow can I change the 192.168.0.12 to something else without Time Machine thinking that it's a completely new backup target (and not realizing that the existing backup is ours)?\n\nA: Just add the destination as a new disk in the Time Machine System Preferences GUI. It is smart enough to figure it out since there are identity tokens stored on the Mac and on the Time Machine destination.\nIt might warn you that the \"identity\" of the new location has changes and you have to approve before continuing to back up.\nTime Machine can handle many destinations from one Mac and just picks up from where it left off for the last backup at that specific destination.\nWorst case, you have to manually inherit the backup after associating with the new share. See the tmutil manual page for details if needed.\n", "Q: How do I use AppleScript or Automator to turn Time Announce on or off at specified times? I like Time Announce during the day while I am working. But I want it off when I am sleeping. \nApple's Do Not Disturb function will mute notifications and sounds associated with them, but it has no effect on Time Announce.\nElsewhere on this site there is an old answer from a number of years ago that offered this script:\ndo shell script \"defaults write ./com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs TimeAnnouncementPrefs -dict TimeAnnouncementsEnabled -bool YES\"\nSimilar script to turn it off.\nAnother answer can be found here, but goes back to the days of Mountain Lion:\nHow do I enable \"Announce the time\" programmatically?\nI am new here and a rank beginner to Aapplescript.

While the first script will compile, when run nothing happens. The script from the page referenced won't even compile. Syntax error about an unknown token after an identifer.\nIn addition, making a change manually to this preference in settings requires my password to unlock. Can AppleScript or Automator deal with that too?\n\nA: UPDATE: This works for me using the latest version of High Sierra. \nThis version will \"turn on\" \"Announce the time:\" if not already enabled\nproperty thePassword : \"yourpassword\"\n\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"ClockPref\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.datetime\"\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        delay 0.5\n        my enterPassword()\n        set theValue to get value of checkbox \"Announce the time:\" of tab group 1 of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\n        if theValue is 0 then\n            click checkbox \"Announce the time:\" of tab group 1 of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\n        end if\n    end tell\n    delay 1\n    quit\nend tell\n\n\non enterPassword()\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        try\n            click button \"Click the lock to make changes.\" of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\n        end try\n        delay 1\n        --activate\n        set value of text field \"Enter password\" of sheet 1 of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\" to thePassword\n        delay 1\n        click UI element \"Unlock\" of sheet 1 of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\n    end tell\nend enterPassword\n\n\nThis version will \"turn off\" \"Announce the time:\" if already enabled\nproperty thePassword : \"yourpassword\"\n\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"ClockPref\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.datetime\"\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        delay 0.5\n        my enterPassword()\n        set theValue to get value of checkbox \"Announce the time:\" of tab group 1 of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\n        if theValue is 1 then\n            click checkbox \"Announce the time:\" of tab group 1 of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\n        end if\n    end tell\n    delay 1\n    quit\nend tell\n\n\non enterPassword()\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        try\n            click button \"Click the lock to make changes.\" of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\n        end try\n        delay 1\n        --activate\n        set value of text field \"Enter password\" of sheet 1 of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\" to thePassword\n        delay 1\n        click UI element \"Unlock\" of sheet 1 of window \"Date & Time\" of application process \"System Preferences\"\n    end tell\nend enterPassword\n\n\n\n\nI could have set the script to perform the action of clicking checkbox \"Announce the time:\" if it was not enabled already… with conditional statements of setting enabled or disabled of that checkbox during certain times.  I figured, for now, it would just be easier to save two different versions of the script.  One version for turning on checkbox \"Announce the time:\"  and one version for turning off checkbox \"Announce the time:”.  In ScriptEditor, just saved each version of the script as applications.  From there just simply open Calendar.app and create two new calender events. one event for enabling checkbox \"Announce the time:\" at whatever time you choose.  And another for disabling..  Once you create the event, just create a custom alert and select the option of open file then choose your script which you saved as an app.\n\n\nA: Easy Fix Via Terminal, If That's Cool\nIf you're still having this issue, it's annoying, but here's a simple way as of Big Sur, in the terminal:\nTurn \"Announce the Time\" On\nplutil -replace TimeAnnouncementPrefs.TimeAnnouncementsEnabled -bool YES /Users/macbook/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist; defaults read com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist;\n\nTurn \"Announce the Time\" Off\nplutil -replace TimeAnnouncementPrefs.TimeAnnouncementsEnabled -bool NO ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist; defaults read com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist;\n\nScheduling\nKeep it simple. Use crontab.\n#m      h       dom     mon     dow     command\n5       23      *       *       *       plutil -repla...\n5       7       *       *       *       plutil -repla...\n\nStating obvious, use the full line (on a single line) vs the ellipses... If you're not familiar with crontab, you can cheat and just use this site (or many others) to generate the full line for you.\nExplanation\nThe first line is an edit command using plutil in the terminal to edit the preferences in com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist.\nYou can use plutil to view the preferences in the terminal as follows:\nplutil -p ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.plist\n\n...which in Big Sur, shows...\n{\n  \"TimeAnnouncementPrefs\" => {\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsEnabled\" => 0\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsIntervalIdentifier\" => \"EveryHourInterval\"\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsPhraseIdentifier\" => \"ShortTime\"\n    \"TimeAnnouncementsVoiceSettings\" => {\n      \"CustomVolume\" => 0.1148504\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe TimeAnnouncementPrefs.TimeAnnouncementsEnabled is the BOOL switch we're toggling on and off with the -bool YES or -bool NO. I'm sure the other settings do something, but honestly, not enough time in the day. I'm simple... on switch/off switch.\nThe second line forces the Mac to reload that pref so you don't need to kill any apps or reboot. If you don't run the second command, the change won't take effect until you reboot or force kill it. (For the CLI folks, it's the Mac equivalent of source ~/.bash_profile when changing PATHs or aliases or whatnot.\nNote if you have the System Preferences -> Dock & Menu Bar -> Clock open in prefs when you do this, the UI will NOT reload to reflect the changes. Close Systems Preferences entirely (vs. arrow back) and reopen (don't save), and you'll see the change reflected. If you don't, the pref is still changed but you run the risk of saving over it.\n", "Q: Does My Photo Stream work without an Internet connection? (local wifi only) I mean when My Photo Stream is enabled on my iPhone, does it upload photos to Apple servers? Then downloads them on other iDevices?\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, Photo Stream will work whenever it is connected to iCloud.\nIt doesn't matter if the connection is via your carrier data plan or via wifi to the internet. But you must in either case be able to connect to the Internet. \nOf course, you must have cellular data turned ON on your device in order to connect to iCloud via cellular.\nWithout the Internet connection to iCloud, you will not be able to use Photo Stream simply between your devices, even if they are all on the same wifi network.\n", "Q: Does Touch Bar Predictive Text Work for Languages Other Than English? I don't have a Touch Bar, but am trying to find out whether, under High Sierra, the predictive text feature works for languages other than English, like French or Spanish,  after either a) changing the keyboard layout, b) changing the system language, or c) setting system preferences/keyboard/text/spelling to the other language.\n\nA: Yes, predictive text displayed on the Touch Bar does indeed work for other languages other than English, although it won't work for all languages.\nIn theory the language used by predictive text is a function of the preferred (i.e. primary) language set in the Language & Region preference pane. While this defaults to a language based on the selected region, you can change it to another language manually (e.g. you live in the US but mainly work in French, so you still have the US set as your region but French set as your primary language). Note that by primary language I mean the one you have placed at the top of the Preferred languages list.\nHowever, in practice (based on about 25 mins of testing using the Italian language), I had the following results:\n\n\n*\n\n*YES, predictive text works with: system language, spellcheck and keyboard all set to Italian\n\n*YES, predictive text works with: spellcheck and keyboard set to Italian, while the system language is set to English\n\n*NO, predictive text does not work with: keyboard set to Italian, while both system language is set to English and spellcheck is set to Automatic.\n\n\nNOTES:\n1 Testing was conducted on 24 October 2017 using TextEdit on a 15\" 2017 MBP with Touch Bar running macOS High Sierra 10.13 (Build 17A405).\n2 By system language I mean the primary language set in the Preferred Languages list located at Apple > System Preferences > Language & Region. If you have more than one language listed, then the primary language is the one listed at top.\n3 By spellcheck I mean the 'Spelling' language set in Apple > System Preferences > Keyboard > Text.\n4 By keyboard I mean the 'input source' set in Apple > System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources. Note that you can have multiple keyboards added here and it does not matter in what order they appear (i.e. I had Italian listed below English).\n", "Q: Any way to adjust Bluetooth radio sensitivity?

I can also access launchpad via the Dock.\nDid I miss any configuration?\nThe hardware is MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)\n\nA: Something similar happened with me yesterday, I started using a brand new MBP, opened the App Store and my Touch Bar showed me five tabs - Featured, Top Charts, Categories, Purchased, Updates - out of which the first tab was ofcourse, highlighted but when I clicked on any of the other 4 tabs, it just wouldn't make the switch. I even tried shutting the app and restarting but it didn't work.\nFew minutes later, I tried again and it worked so maybe it was just a software glitch and Apple probably still needs to fix some bugs. Who knows if it's the same with your Touch Bar? I just tried and my Expose & Launchpad are working fine, so maybe if you give your machine a reboot or just try again after sometime it might work.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Flush cache of DNS on macOS Sierra & High Sierra How to flush the cache of the DNS system on a macOS Sierra or High Sierra Mac?\nI have seen discussion of the following, but am not sure if this is the modern approach. And I am not sure what each does exactly.\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n\nA: I've discovered an alternate way to clear the DNS cache, and you don't need any root permissions. Here's the shell script I use to help automate this.\nNETWORKSVC=\"Wi-Fi\"\nDNSSERVERS=`networksetup -getdnsservers $NETWORKSVC | tr '\\n' ' '`\n\nif [ \"$DNSSERVERS\" = \"There aren't any DNS Servers set on Wi-Fi. \" ]; then\n    DNSSERVERS=\"Empty\"\nfi\n\nnetworksetup -setdnsservers $NETWORKSVC 0.1.2.3\nnetworksetup -setdnsservers $NETWORKSVC $DNSSERVERS\n\nSet your network service name in the first line. The second line gets your currently set DNS Servers. As the getdnsservers subcommand returns one DNS server per line, we use tr (transform) to change the newlines into spaces.\nThe if statement handles the special case of where your DNS servers have been handed down via DHCP.\nNext, we change the DNS server to an obviously fake one. This triggers the DNS cache to be cleared. You can confirm that it is actually cleared using klanomath's technique.\nThe last line restores your original DNS servers. The setdnsservers subcommand expects the list of DNS servers to be space separated.\nYou can also just do all of this in System Preferences, but the shell script is faster and is basically instant.\n\nA: sudo dscacheutil -flushcache does nothing useful related to DNS cache entries - at least in non-LDAP environments and 10.9-10.13.\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder sends a hang up to mDNSResponder, launchd will restart the daemon and the DNS cache will be cleared as spillover effect.\nThis can easily be tested with the following command sequence:\nsudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder\n\n\ndefault    03:54:55.672826 +0200   mDNSResponder   Cache size 282 entities; 189 in use (73 group, 29 multicast, 87 unicast); 2 referenced by active questions\n  default    03:54:55.694219 +0200   mDNSResponder   Unicast Cache size              1769\n\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache\nsudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder\n\n\ndefault    03:55:52.148629 +0200   mDNSResponder   Cache size 282 entities; 180 in use (79 group, 19 multicast, 82 unicast); 2 referenced by active questions\n  default    03:55:52.157180 +0200   mDNSResponder   Unicast Cache size              1992\n\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\nsudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder\n\n\ndefault    03:56:39.446829 +0200   mDNSResponder   Cache size 282 entities; 8 in use (4 group, 0 multicast, 4 unicast); 2 referenced by active questions\n  default    03:56:39.466259 +0200   mDNSResponder   Unicast Cache size              121\n\nTo get the results above open Console.app, choose your hostname in \"Devices\" and use a filter mDNSResponder & Cache size:\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove one word from iOS autocorrect?

How can I find a value using multiple criteria?\nLet's say I have a table of flights, with columns for the flight date, flight number (including airline code), booking code, etc.; and another table that contains the earnings in a frequent flyer program (award miles, elite miles, elite dollars) for each airline, date range, and booking code.  For each flight (row) in the first table, I need to find the row in the second table that matches the airline code from the flight number, the flight date, and the booking code.  I'll then take the value in a specific column of that row and multiply it by the flight distance to get the earnings for that category.\nExample:\nTable 1 (\"Flights\") has columns such as:\n\nTable 2 (\"Per-Airline\") has columns such as:\n\nFor the \"Projected EQM\" column for a flight (e.g., flight in row 3, the second flight), I want to find the row in Table 2 (\"Per-Airline\") where:\n\n\n*\n\n*The airline code matches the code at the start of the flight number\n(e.g., \"cx\")\n\n*The \"Flight Dates From\" column is either blank or no earlier than the flight date\n\n*The \"Flight Dates To\" column is either blank or no later than the flight date\n\n*The \"Booking Code\" column contains the booking code of the flight\n\n\nIn the example, row 96 matches.\nThen, I need to take the value in the \"EQM\" column of that that row (1.5) and multiply it by the value in the \"Flight Miles\" column.  The result is the \"Projected EQM\".\nHow would I do this?  I've read through the descriptions of the likely functions (LOOKUP, VLOOKUP, MATCH, INDEX) but can only see how to search using a single criterion.\n\nA: I've gotten it working now, by extending techniques discussed elsewhere (which uses an extra column to contain an aggregate of the match criteria).\nTo handle the date ranges, I created an extra lookup table that assigns an arbitrary single value to each date range:\n\nIn the per-airline earnings lookup table, I added an extra column to hold the Date-Code for the date range, using VLOOKUP against the date-from column, with exact-match, since it finds the largest value that's smaller than the criterion:\n\nAnd another extra column to hold a calculated lookup-string that's a concatenation of the airline, the booking codes, and the date range code:\n\nThen, in the main table (that holds the flights taken), I added an extra column to contain the lookup string, which is a concatenation of the airline, the date range code only if applicable, and the booking code with asterisks on either side as wild cards, and another extra column to hold the calculated row of the per-airline lookup table:\n\n(Of course, I could have avoided adding two extra columns in both tables by making the formulas more complex, but I opted for better readability.)\nThen, the actual earnings columns in the main table uses the LOOKUP function with the calculated per-airline lookup table row and the applicable column, e.g.,:\n= IF ( $PNR '1' = \"\", \"\",  ROUNDUP ( IF ( INDEX ( 'Per-Airline',  $Lookup Row '1', COLUMN ( 'RDM per $ (EXP)' ) ) > 0, INDEX ( 'Per-Airline',  $Lookup Row '1', COLUMN ( 'RDM per $ (EXP)' ) ) * \n\n", "Q: Is there more efficient way to use the usb c ports for external display on macbookpro?

But it won't do what you want, because the environment variable substitutions you're used to are done by the shell; most GUI inputs (like the Finder's Go To Folder command) are not parsed by a shell, so no environment variable substitution is performed. The Go To Folder operation in your screenshot isn't looking for a variable named \"dev\", it's looking for a folder literally named \"$dev\".\n", "Q: iPhone Music app: music with an iCloud status of Uploaded can't be played? I have a PC (running Windows) with a collection of MP3 files I ripped from CD. I installed iTunes (12.7.0.166) and setup iCloud Music Library, and it went through the uploading/matching process on my files.\nFrom my iPhone (iOS 11.0.3, and which has iCloud Music Library enabled), I can see all of my library in the Music App. However I noticed that some files would not play - a popup would appear saying \"Item Not Available\" and \"This item can't be played\".\nI did a little digging in my library, and I found that I have this problem with files with an iCloud status of Uploaded. I can play files with a status of Matched just fine.\nThe files with a status of Uploaded are not available on Apple Music or the iTunes store - e.g. Turkish music from the 60s. So they will never become Matched. But, I should still be able to play them as an Apple Music or iTunes Match subscriber - that is supposed to be a selling point of iCloud Music Library.\nIs there something wrong with my library (iTunes side or iPhone side) that is preventing these songs from playing? I have fewer than 100,000 songs, so that is not the problem.\n\nA: The problem should be in iTunes on your PC.\nSince Apple Music couldn't find any matching, iTunes Match should automatically upload your song, only if they are matching the specifications. They are found in the section \"About file formats\"\n\nA: I think I figured this out. What fixed it for me was plugging my iPhone into the computer with my iTunes library, and syncing. I had not done that since iTunes had finished uploading my collection.\nIt didn't seem to transfer any files (other than doing a backup), but after that, I could play all of my songs on my phone.\n", "Q: What does it mean for consumers that Apple has released MacOS kernel as open source? https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/01/apple-open-sourced-the-kernel-of-ios-and-macos-for-arm-processors/\nDoes this mean we'll see other Computers (which are not Apple built) run the MacOS?\nIf not, then what would happen?\nFrom what I understand, Unix kernel is released too, and Linux was created. Should the same happen to Apple's kernel?\n\nA: Clarification:\nApple has always released the kernel of MacOS in an open source form.  The kernel is named Darwin. Darwin has a target of x86.  It can be ported to other processors, but the open source variant of Darwin that Apple controls and releases was only available for x86.\nHowever, iOS, which uses ARM processors, has used Darwin since its inception.  Apple has never released the ARM port of Darwin, even though they obviously have one since they're using it in millions of iOS devices already in consumer hands.\nThis announcement is that Apple is now releasing the ARM pieces of Darwin that they previously withheld.\nDarwin is just a kernel, it doesn't include most of what makes the MacOS or iOS operate as a consumer expects them to.  A kernel is not a complete operating system.\nFurther, Darwin is not a complete kernel.  Apple doesn't release many portions of it.\n\nWhat does it mean for consumers that Apple has released MacOS kernel as open source?\n\nNot much, initially.  It will not affect the availability of hardware or software, upgrades, and probably won't even have a substantial impact on jailbreaking or similar alternate uses of apple devices.\n\nDoes this mean we'll see other Computers (which are not Apple built) run the MacOS?\n\nIt does not affect the availability of non Apple hardware devices running Apple software or operating systems.  What's already available won't become more or less available or more or less legal.\n\nIf not, then what would happen?\n\nThe most likely explanation, and how consumers will benefit, comes from an earlier release of code Apple usually holds close to its chest, \"Apple confirms iOS kernel code left unencrypted intentionally\" which suggests:\n\nApple has begun to shift towards greater transparency, particularly on security issues, in the wake of its battle with the FBI over unlocking an iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. When the FBI attempted to compel Apple to unlock the phone, CEO Tim Cook penned a rare open letter to Apple’s customers, explaining his decision to resist. “We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government,” Cook wrote. (The FBI eventually dropped its request after paying a third party to break into the device.)\nOpening up the kernel’s code for inspection could weaken the market for security flaws like the one the FBI is presumed to have used to get into the San Bernardino iPhone. If flaws are revealed quickly and widely, it will reduce the prices law enforcement and black markets will pay for them — and it could mean quicker fixes for Apple’s customers.\n\nSo the consumer benefit is that more eyes, specifically security researchers, will be on the code and hopefully this will bring to light weaknesses in security, allowing Apple the ability to improve security for customers rather than finding out their security is broken when a government or third party is able to take away someone's rights without due process.\nWhether this plays out positively, though, depends on researchers volunteering to comb through the code.\n\nFrom what I understand, Unix kernel is released too, and Linux was created. Should the same happen to Apple's kernel?\n\nApple started with the original BSD code, which, using the BSD license, doesn't require that companies or individuals release their changes to the code to the people they distribute compiled software to.  Indeed, they chose this over the Linux kernel specifically so they could keep certain intellectual property secret (among many other reasons, of course).\nSo they do not have a legal obligation to release all their code. Some of the software they use does have other licenses, such as GPL, which does require they keep it open source. Much of these are available from Apple now.\nThis does, however, also point to another possibility: many kernel pieces are released so developers can develop MacOS hardware and specialized software.  This is much deeper into the system than app developers are allowed access to for iOS devices.\nThis release, then, suggests one or both of two strong possibilities (and this is complete conjecture):\n\n*\n\n*Apple is preparing to release MacOS computers using their A series ARM processors.\n\n*Apple is preparing to allow developers to make deeper-level software for iOS devices.\n\nI'd say MacOS computers using ARM processors is more likely, as the latest A11 chip, used in the iPhone 8 and X, beats the latest Intel i5 chip, used in the 2017 Macbook 13\".  Apple still has a ways to go before they can replace Intel processors along their whole line, however we may see, within a year or two, low end MacOS computers with A12 or A13 chips, replacing the Intel chips previously used.\nThis would provide significant benefit to Apple (particularly its bottom line).\nHowever, without an official statement there's no way to know what reasons Apple has for releasing the ARM portions of its already largely open source Darwin kernel.\nThe consumer will be impacted very little, if at all, and if so only indirectly.\n\nA: It means nothing. The macOS/OS X kernel has always been open source. The kernel is only a tiny part of a complete operating system, so it doesn’t let anyone else release their own version of MacOS. \n\nA: One major impact has been on the software security field. The iOS kernel has not previously been open-sourced: the public sources previously only covered x86/x64 platforms, without any of the ARM/ARM64 parts that run on iOS. The kernel was also previously encrypted in the iOS firmware and is very tricky to extract, making it previously very difficult to perform security evaluations of the iOS kernel - a kind of “security by obscurity”. \nBy open-sourcing the kernel and leaving the kernel unencrypted, the iOS kernel can now be more freely analyzed and probed for security vulnerabilities (https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/22/apple-unencrypted-kernel/). This will be a positive step for kernel security in general because it means that iOS kernel vulnerability research will be more open to ordinary researchers who may disclose issues to Apple, rather than just limited to e.g. state-funded actors. \n", "Q: Notes as reminders Is there a way with Apple Notes to set a time to be reminded of a note, as in Google Keep? Or must I set a reminder separately which reminds me to check the note?\n\nA: If you're using Notes within macOS you can trigger a reminder fairly easily. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Within Notes on macOS, ensure you have a note selected\n\n*In the toolbar, click on the Share icon and select the Reminders option (alternatively you can go to File > Share > Reminders)\n\n*This brings up a Reminders popup pre-populated with the name of your selected note\n\n*Now click on the Info icon at top right of the popup to set how you want to be reminded (see screenshot below)\n\n\n\nThe above screenshot shows the popup that appears when I created a dummy note called Luke's Question and then opted to share it to Reminders. By clicking on the blue info icon I get the options to remind me on a day, etc.\n\n\n*Click on the Add button at bottom right to add it to your Reminders\n\n\nNow at the appointed time (or location) you'll get a reminder about the note. And, if you originally created the note as part of your iCloud notes, then this will get synced to your other devices as well.\n", "Q: Safari search google directly on right click highlighted link text I am using Safari 11 on macOS 10.13.\nJust wondering why right clicking the link text would make \"Search with Google\" moved to \"Services\"?\nThanks.\nNormal Search with Google:\n\nMore steps for a Google search:\n\n\nA: It's all about the definition of service, by the way also in the 'normal search' you can find 'Search with google' also under the services, is repeated\n", "Q: Unable to launch photos library repair tool in macOS high sierra?

If so, any other indications as to why my fans go into hyper-drive when the screensaver turns on?\n\nA: My fanspeed also was incredibly high when on OSX stock screensaver. Some virus scans and resetting of the MacBooks PRAM and VRAM later, I did a check and graphed the cpu usage. It was indeed the screensaver process which kept cpu at 100%.\nIt was set to a transition of pictures in a folder. Apparently the fade and float effect is too much for the mac.

If I take use a USB Type A to USB Type C cable, (like this) and plug it into a wall converter similar to the ones that come with iPhone charger (basically just a little box that plugs into a wall and has a female USB Type A port), will it be safe to plug the USB Type C end into my new MacBook pro to keep the battery from dying?\nI just need it to maintain the battery level and I want to make sure it's not going to damage the overall life of the batter.\n\nA: I'm able to charge my MacBook Pro with my Xiaomi power bank 10000mAh with QuickCharge 3 and it works perfectly! :)\n\nA: Yes, and it is safe. I did charge my 15\" MBP from various sources - power banks and adapters (USB Port of a Tesla Model S was my favorite), and it can take around 13W. Just make sure that your adapter supports 10-15W, 5W is quite slow. Unfortunately the port does not support Quick Charge.\nWhen idling, the system consumes around 6W, charging will be impossible while using with something more cpu/gpu intensive.\nAnd if you decide to cheat and try to connect a second charger, it will not combine the power, but instead choose the one with higher power rating.\nTL;DR: It's possible. It's safe (It'll cause 100% use on your adapter, might heat it up). Perfect for emergency use or when weight is important. Not useful if you plan to do extensive work.\n\nA: I don't think that will work. According to Apple, power adapters for Intel-based Apple notebooks are available in 45W, 60W, and 85W varieties. Although you should always use the proper wattage adapter for your Apple notebook, you can use an adapter of a higher wattage without issue.\nAn iPhone charger delivers 5 Watts (5 volts at 1000 mA). A Retina iPad mini charger delivers 10 watts (5.1 volts at 2100 mA). \nNot enough power to charge a MacBook Pro. Plus the new MacBooks have a much longer battery life than do the old ones. It is actually good for the battery to be allowed to fully discharge. It is not good practice to leave your MacBook Pro on AC power all the time. If you work where there is always AC power available, once a week, unplug the computer and let it run on the battery until it goes to sleep. If you are worried about losing work, just unplug the computer overnight.\nIt is not good to fully discharge the lipo battery in your laptop. Unlike the older ni-cd or ni-mh batteries, li-po cells should never be discharged completely or charged to above 80%iirc. While the battery is in these states the cell is stressed. The damage doesn't occur from leaving the battery on a charger for a long amount of time but from being kept at a capacity above or below it's ideal rating. You could trickle charge it all you want, if it never goes above 80% you would be doing your battery a service. \n", "Q: AppleScript to copy images that names are multiple of 30 to another folder I have a folder with hundreds of pictures like this:\nMontana_1.jpg, Montana_2.jpg, …, Montana_4500.jpg\nI only want to use the pictures where the name is multiple of 30. I was wondering if an AppleScript would\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the folder containing the pictures.\n\n*Copy only the pictures that are multiple of 30 like\nMontana_30.jpg, Montana_60.jpg, …, Montana_120.jpg.\n\n*Move to another folder.\n\n\nAnother way could be to delete any picture that is not multiple of 30.\n\nA: You can do this from the command line. The following will match all images which are a multiple of 30 and copy them to the destination folder.\n/bin/zsh -c \"cp /path/to/source/Montana_{30..4500..30}.jpg /path/to/destination/\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace /path/to/source with the path to the containing folder for the images.\n\n*Replace 4500 with the number of the last image in the folder.\n\n*Replace /path/to/destination with the path to the containing folder where the images which are a multiple of 30 will be copied to.\n\n\nTo move instead of copy, replace cp with mv.\nTo use this in an AppleScript, you can ‘do shell script’.\n", "Q: Downgrading a new Mac to OS X Tiger? I have a kinda odd question. In theory, would it be possible for a new Mac (Lets say a fancy new MBP) to downgrade from macOS High Sierra to a OS X 10.4.11 Tiger Intel build? If so, what would be the complications of doing so, and would doing so make it irreversible?\n\nA: Golden Rule: No Mac can run an OS older than the OS it shipped with.\nThe hardware drivers do not exist, as the hardware wasn't invented at the time.\nFrom Snow Leopard Server 10.6/Lion 10.7 you could virtualise it in Parallels etc, but nothing before that.\n\nA: Probably not, but there is a slim chance.\nTiger would have supported Code 2 Duo (C2D) machines since some were introduced in 2006 during Tiger's reign. The last version of Tiger was released around November of 2007 by which time Apple would have been shipping only Leopard (10.5) with new machines. All of the C2D machines presumably have a 64-bit EFI whereas the older \"Core Duo\" (note no '2') were 32-bit.\nThe one thing that is a fairly low-level \"make or break\" factor on Intel hardware is the combination of CPU and the Intel \"chipset\", i.e. the main support chip(s) that are required for the CPU. An example from the C2D days is the Intel P45. Simply put, this is where you get the interface to memory, PCI lanes, USB, etc. Operating systems need to know how to speak to this more so than the CPU since this is all the distinct services for the x86 platform.\nSo while the chipset probably didn't change much between the C2D machines, what would have changed was the GPU they shipped with it. 2006/2007 had a mixture of nVidia, ATi/AMD and Intel graphics. I believe a 2009 MacBook shipped with an ATi Radeon 9000 series which support might be in Tiger for, but most likely not since the PCI Express ID signatures would probably get missed and thus you'd have no video. Unlike Windows, OSX is very picky about GPU drivers and if it doesn't recognize the PCIe ID of a GPU it won't fail-over to a basic VGA mode like Windows would.\nThat being said, if you can somehow convince the Mac to install Tiger, you could look into editing the plist files that identify the list of GPUs and try to pick one that is \"close enough\". However, this would not be easy and requires rebuilding kext plists and all sorts of magic that is not trivial.\nThe only other thing that might catch you is that the Tiger installation scripts might not recognize the motherboard/Gestalt ID of the newer machine and could stop right there. Obviously Hackintosh folks got around this, but you'd have to dig back to find notes from the Tiger days.\nIn short, I'm guessing that the OS would probably work on the 2009 MacBook, but whether or not you get a display is the place one would get hung up.\n\nA: No, you can‘t. Older OSX/macOS versions lack the drivers required to run on newer hardware. Usually you can‘t go back before the macOS Version your shiny new Mac was delivered with. \n", "Q: How to attach file to Outlook from terminal using Applescript?

Command + Z won't take me back far enough.\nWould restoring from Time Machine work? (I'm thinking not, since Notes are in the cloud?)\nCould I maybe just access it somehow via Time Machine?\n\nA: Assuming you have Time Machine backups, and assuming the text you recently deleted was in an earlier version of your notes that was backed up by TM, you should be able to recover your Notes data from an earlier backup.\nHowever, you will want to make sure you have a current backup as well - otherwise any new notes you've added may be lost.\nSo, the way I would approach this is:\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect your Mac from the internet\n\n\n*Make sure you have a current backup\n\n\n*Restore the entire Notes folder from an appropriate earlier backup - it's located at:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/\n\n\n*Access the data you need\n\n\n*Copy the content you accidentally deleted and paste it into another file (e.g. a TextEdit doc, etc)\n\n\n*Restore your notes from the backup at Step 2 above\n\n\n*Edit the note to include the missing data you copied at Step 5\n\n\n*Once you're happy with everything, reconnect your Mac to the internet\nNOTE: Steps 1 is necessary to ensure that iCloud doesn't sync old data across your devices.\n", "Q: Mission control shortcuts stopped working, how do I restart it?

Can I charge my headphones with the MacBook 12\" charger or should I use it for charging the MacBook only?\nThe headphones are Plantronics BACKBEAT SENSE which have a USB-Micro charging port.\nI believe I need to buy a cable USB-C to Micro-USB, if it would work.\n\nA: A USB charger is universally compatible with devices that use the USB interface to recharge.  An Apple MacBook USB charger will charge any device including Android, Microsoft, or no-name type devices - including your Plantronics headset.\nApple provides you a USB-C port as shown in the image (below left) .  You just need a cable that's compatible with your device and in your case, a USB-C to USB micro cable (right)\n\n\nAs long as you have the right cable, you can recharge anything so long as you don't exceed the power rating on your adapter.\nThis means that if your headphones require only 5W to charge, then this adapter will work.  If your Android tablet requires 10W it will charge.  However, if your friend brings his shiny new MacBook Pro which requires 65W, it will either charge very slowly or not at all.\nYou can always use/charge devices that are less-than or equal to the wattage rating of the charger, but not vice versa.\nAs for picking adapters/cables, always buy a quality product.  You can rest assured that Apple is a quality brand (though expensive).  As for cables, stick with reputable manufacturers from reputable sellers.  Saving a few dollars on poorly made adapters can cost you dearly in the long run.  See this video for what happens.\n\nA: My Bose NC 700 also will not charge using the apple charger I have for my iPad. Any other type c charger seems to work fine\n\nA: The iPhone charger is often 5V x 1A (i.e. 5W - iPads use identical voltage however double the amperage) - if your headphones area unit rated to handle those amounts, then mustn't be AN issue; additionally, despite the ratings, several of the devices are often charged mistreatment higher electrical phenomenon (I have my woman charge her iPhone on a dual-2A AC adapter - charges abundant faster). on your iMac's USB ports, you would like to inform America the model/year of your pc on w/ the USB version - the ability output from these ports varies and older ones don't work effectively charge iPads; once more, I assume your headphones would like less charging electric power.\n", "Q: Changing placeholder texts in Pages using AppleScript I've got a Pages document \"test\" with a text box which has the text \"Footnotes\" in it.

We use Apple MDM at the small school I work at to manage our iPads.  In the past we would download the .ipa from the App Store then upload it to the MDM then deploy it to the iPads.  With the new updates we can't figure out a way to download the .ipa files?  Can anyone help?

I just downloaded Code 2000 from Wayback Machine but when I tried to install it Font Book reported a serious error but no further details.\nAnyone know what might be the problem? Are there any online resources that allows me to verify a font's integrity and hopefully could give me some more details about any potential issues?\n\nA: In my experience Font Book warnings rarely have any real consequences.\nIt's also hard to imagine any issues that could not be easily fixed by just removing the font.  Install it manually in Home/Library/Fonts and see if you find any problems.\nTo get to Home/Library, hold down the option key while doing Finder > Go.\nIf your goal is to ensure complete Unicode coverage, I suspect MacOS already has more of this than the very old Code 2000.  To expand coverage beyond what Apple offers, I would recommend the Google Noto fonts and Symbola.\nTo see what font has a specific character when Apple's Character Viewer is empty, try Fileformat.\n", "Q: How can you find which monitor has the menu bar in AppleScript? Playing with AppleScript I want to manipulate the location of a few windows with position but I'm having an issue defining the monitor.  Currently I have several different size and brand monitors I connect to with my MacBook during my travels.  The only repeating occurrence with all four monitors I connect to is that the monitor I want to manipulate includes the menu bar.\nWhen testing with do shell script \"system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType I'm not sure if the returned text of Main Display: Yes considers the main to be where the menu bar resides from the extraction:\nGraphics/Displays:\n\n    Intel Iris Pro:\n\n      Chipset Model: Intel Iris Pro\n      Type: GPU\n      Bus: Built-In\n      VRAM (Dynamic, Max): 1536 MB\n      Metal: Supported\n      Displays:\n        Color LCD:\n          Display Type: Built-In Retina LCD\n          Resolution: 2880 x 1800 Retina\n          Mirror: Off\n          Online: Yes\n          Rotation: Supported\n          Automatically Adjust Brightness: Yes\n          Connection Type: DisplayPort\n        Thunderbolt Display:\n          Display Type: LCD\n          Resolution: 2560 x 1440\n          Main Display: Yes\n          Mirror: Off\n          Online: Yes\n          Rotation: Supported\n          Automatically Adjust Brightness: No\n          Connection Type: DisplayPort\n\nIf my assumption of the Main Display is correct how should I properly grep the resolution of the identified main display so I can manipulate the windows?\nWhen I research it would appear some commonly just step into each display:\n\n\n*\n\n*Positioning a window with AppleScript using dual monitors\n\n*Run AppleScript for Specific Monitor\n\n*Cannot get or set the window size of some apps using AppleScript?\n\n*Set position of window with AppleScript\nSo I don't know if this would be two questions in one.  I'm somewhat confused on how the sequence is determined when connecting to multiple monitors (such as today I might be connected to a thunderbolt display but tomorrow I might be connected to two Dells monitors through my two DisplayPorts) and if there is a way to target a monitor in particular based on the menu bar.  \nI can already detect the app and it's size with:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Notes\" to set theSize to get size of window 1\nset theWidth to item 1 of theSize\nset theHeight to item 2 of theSize\n\nbut my issue falls in determining the resolution so I can calculate the position and bounds to move the app window.\n\nA: UPDATE\nRemoved my original answer.

Note that space is used here to denote a single space character (ASCII 32).\n\n*\\t - Matches a tab character (ASCII 9).\n\n\n*+ - Matches between one and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy).\n\n*\\\"\\\" - Replacement is with nothing (\"\"). The \"\" are escaped, \\, so the command can be compiled and passed to the shell. If entered directly on the command line the \"\" would not need to be escaped.\n\n\n*print $0 - Prints the full record. - In this case it prints the fifth line above Main Display:, san the leading whitespace.\n\n*exit - Exits after printing the first record.\n\n\n\n\nCommand portion of the do shell script command:\nsystem_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep -B 3 'Main Display:' | awk '/Resolution:/{print $2,$3,$4}'\n\nIn this do shell script command the awk '/Resolution:/{print $2,$3,$4}' portion does the following:\nThe output of e.g.:\n$ system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep -B 3 'Main Display:'\n          Resolution: 2560 x 1440\n          Pixel Depth: 32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)\n          Display Serial Number: C08Z4120F6FB\n          Main Display: Yes\n$\n\nGets piped to awk and it searches the input for a record containing Resolution: which finds the following record match:\n          Resolution: 2560 x 1440\n\nThe print $2,$3,$4 command, prints the second, third and fourth fields of the record. The , comma between the $n fields is to insert a space. The output of which is:\n2560 x 1440\n\n\nA: In my testing, you are correct that the main display is the one with the menu assigned in Displays System Prefs. I tested by moving the menu bar from one display to the other and running your script. The results suggest that wherever the menu bar is, that display will have \"Main Display: Yes\" in its information.\nTo parse the resolution, I would use the -xml argument to the system_profiler command to get some consistent text to look for, and then use Apple's text item delimiters to parse the data. I wrote this script, and when I switch the menu back and forth, it returns the resolution of the current main display. You may need to tweak the delimiters depending on what your OS returns for the system profiler report.\nI added inline comments in the code below to explain what the script is doing.\nset pfl to do shell script \"system_profiler -xml SPDisplaysDataType\"\n\nset tid to text item delimiters\nset text item delimiters to \"</data><key>_name</key>\"--in my reports, each display section starts with this xml code\n\nignoring white space --allows us to not worry about returns, tabs, spaces, etc.\n    repeat with i from 2 to count of pfl's text items\n        set aDisplay to pfl's text item i\n        if aDisplay contains \"<key>spdisplays_main</key><string>spdisplays_yes</string>\" then--check if this display is the main\n            set text item delimiters to \"<key>_spdisplays_resolution</key><string>\"--this is the xml code for the resolution\n            set displayRes to aDisplay's text item 2\n            set text item delimiters to \"</string\"--remove the ending xml code\n            set displayRes to displayRes's text item 1\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend ignoring\nset text item delimiters to tid --always text text item delimiters back to default\nreturn displayRes\n\nEDIT: Because you posted the regular form of the system_profiler above, I re-wrote the script to parse that output. It seems a bit riskier to me than using the xml, but it should compile and run correctly on your system without any tweaks.\nset pfl to do shell script \"system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType\"\nset tid to text item delimiters\nset text item delimiters to \"Displays:\"\nset pfl to text item 3 of pfl\nset text item delimiters to \"Mirror:\"\nrepeat with i from 1 to count of pfl's text items\n    set aDisplay to pfl's text item i\n    ignoring white space\n        if aDisplay contains \"Main Display: Yes\" then\n            if aDisplay contains \"Resolution:\" then\n                set text item delimiters to \"Resolution: \"\n                set displayRes to text item 2 of aDisplay\n                considering white space\n                    set text item delimiters to \"\\r\" --line breaks should be \\r\n                    set displayRes to text item 1 of displayRes\n                    set text item delimiters to \"\\n\" --or they might be \\n\n                    set displayRes to text item 1 of displayRes\n                end considering\n            end if\n        end if\n    end ignoring\n    set text item delimiters to \"Mirror:\"\nend repeat\nset text item delimiters to tid\nreturn displayRes\n\n", "Q: Get System Profiler Information without a macOS Installation I have a bunch of factory reset MacBooks.

I recently received a sound from my phone indicating a voicemail, even though no phone call preceded it. When I check my voicemail, I see a blank screen with 'Call Voicemail' in the center. If I push on the message a phone pad comes up for me to call voicemail. I've never done this so I called my own number. It asked for my password. I don't recall ever setting up a password. I made some guesses but they didn't work. Why am I getting this call voicemail message and is there anything to do if I can't recall my password?\n\nA: You should probably call your carrier and ask them to sort it out.\nFrom this Apple Support article:\n\nOnly your wireless carrier can access and manage the voicemail account for your phone number.

I partitioned out another chunk of the Macintosh HD into:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu HD (≈50GB) - ExFAT, No Encryption\n\n\nAll of the above was done through Disk Utility except for changing the Windows HD partition to NTFS when I was installing windows to the drive a year or two ago.\nThe problem:\nI go to install Ubuntu on the partition (despite reading about problems with two file systems on the same drive) as I've done it before on older computers. I first converted the Ubuntu HD into the ext4 format using the Ubuntu installer utility, but then afterwards the install of the Ubuntu OS failed a couple times in a row, leaving me with what I believe was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macintosh HD (≈900GB) - Mac OSX Extended Journaled, FireVault Encrypted\n\n*Windows HD (≈100GB) - NTFS, No Encryption\n\n*Ubuntu HD (≈50GB)- Ext4, No Encryption\n\n\nJust a note that I never actually checked that the formatting of the Ubuntu HD partition was successful so it is possible that it was still ExFAT\nI restarted the computer back into OS X partition and went clear the partition again and try to install again over a FAT format. Brought up Disk Utility and attempted to remove the small Ubuntu partition and the process failed. I tried a couple more times to no avail and thought i should restart and format the partition back to ExFAT using the Ubuntu install utility. When I restarted the computer holding the \"option\" key none of my Boot Disks were there… just one disk named \"Windows\" which seems to be a small part of Ubuntu which leaves me just at a black screen where i can type some code for Ubuntu.\nWhat have I tried?:\nFrom what I can tell it seems like I have screwed up the partition map in one way or another. I have reset the PRAM/NVRAM, I have reset the SMC, and I then started the computer in recovery mode. In the recovery mode disk utility I was able to see and access both my Macintosh HD and Windows HD partitions. I have attempted First Aid on the Macintosh HD partition with a failed result. However when I ran First Aid on the entire APPLE SSD SM1024G drive the process was successful.  It however mentions that \"Problems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting\" (this was my first sign that there were problems with the partition map).\nI next attempted to choose the startup disk in the recovery OS, which it allowed me to select once or twice but then upon restart i would just get the black code screen for Ubuntu. Later attempts to select startup disk through Recovery OS  came to give me an error mentioning \"Building Boot Caches on the Boot helper partition Failed\" (Further cluing me to partition map problems). \nFurthermore I tried reinstall the OS on Macintosh HD which it would not allow me to do saying that \"you cannot startup from this disk\". What I have ended up doing just as a temporary fix to back up files and reach out for help here is: I used the Recovery tools to install OS X onto an external drive and boot from that drive which will in turn also be showing up in any terminal readouts I give to clarify my problems. The physical disk I am currently booting from has 2 partitions on it (the second one being the backup of my Windows HD partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*OSX BOOTDISK (≈125GB) Mac OS Extended Journaled, No Encryption\n\n*WINDOW HD R (≈125GB) ExFAT, No Encryption\n\n\nNotes\nThe External drive I am booting from has one of those CDs that appear whenever it is plugged in, that disk shows up as:\nWD SmartWare (≈165MB)\nThe partition that was once Ubuntu HD now shows in Disk utility only as part of the APPLE SSD SM1024G partition pie chart as:\nUntitled (≈50GB) OS X Journaled, No Encryption\nWhat am I looking for?\nI will pretty much take what i can get in terms of a fix once I have completed the new backup of all my data. I'm guessing that I could probably format the entire APPLE SSD SM1024G drive and reinstall OS X to start over, re-partitioning my drive and installing each OS again and then pulling over all my data from the backups I am making.

The iPhone can be locked which would require fingerprint touch or 6 digit passcode, but for example a moment ago she was ‘editing’ my carrier settings. My baby bought an app a month ago and upon my requesting a refund Apple told me to make sure my phone was locked, which i thought it had been...but gave it the benefit of the doubt.  But, recently I have been catching more and more times when we let her explore the item ensuring it’s locked only to have her unlock it.\nAny ideas how she could do this? Do I need to eliminate lock screen shortcuts?  They require Touch ID.  Turn off fingerprint recognition?  I thought fingerprints were unique, and her fingers are tiny.\n  I want her to be able to explore technology; so I don’t t want to completely remove all devices.\n\nA: There's something like a 1:50k chance of someone having a fingerprint that can unlock your phone, according to Apple. \nThose odds drop dramatically for a relative - though right now I cannot find a citation for that, I did read it on teh interwebz so it must be true ;-)\nGoogling finds a million scare stories but I can find no hard fact to support my claim.\nI'd say you just have to keep watching her until she does it, see if her fingerprint can actually unlock your phone. [I'm not experienced enough at parenting to suggest you make her do it repeatedly to see if it works.]  \nThe chances are very much against her guessing the passcode - it would be far more likely that she'd activate the timed lockout instead.\n\nA: I would think that your 10mo hasn't been unlocking the phone, you're probably just leaving it available to her when it hasn't completely locked. By this, I mean you either gave it to her in an application and she figured out how to get out of it or your \"require password after n minutes\" setting isn't short enough. So two things I can suggest: changing the timeout and locking the environment.\nChanging the Timeout is done from the settings menu, \"Touch ID and Passcode\".

Go to the IOS section and un-enroll your device from the beta program. It should then allow you to download the non beta updated version of IOS 11.\nIt is likely the same build that you are running now. I am not sure if beta builds have extra debugging code in them or not. If this does not fix it you may need to back up the phone, erase it and restore from backup.\n\nA: Figured out how to do it! Here's the steps in case anyone else needs help with this. \nHead into Settings > General > Profile > Tap on your profile and then tap on Remove profile. \nNow Restart your phone and navigate to the Software Update section and you will be able to download the regular version of iOS 11.\n", "Q: New iPhone 8 asking for App Store password for someone else's account I have an iPhone 8 that was set up from an iPhone 7 backup.\nEvery few minutes I get a popup asking for an App Store password, except the account it's specifying is an account that belongs to a family member.\nSimilar questions say that this can happen when an app was installed using a different App Store ID.

It was serviced once for a warranty battery replacement by an Apple Authorized Service Provider.\nThe Problem - Crashing/Freezing\nVarious apps (seems any app can be affected including Apple apps like Safari) are freezing up, usually on launch. Sometimes they crash and close down within seconds. Other times they freeze up for anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. The phone is completely unresponsive during this time (no app switcher or sleep/wake), with the only exception being I can hold home & sleep/wake to reset. When things resume, any of the previous button presses will be processed, however. Sometimes it happens while an app is running, and sometimes the app or portions of the app become unresponsive while app switching works normally.\nAdditional Consequences\nRegardless of the app, once this has happened once, audio playback starts to break down. The system starts to confuse iTunes and Podcasts. Control Centre or Apple Watch might not show the correct playback status. For example, while listening to a Podcast there might be a \"Play\" button. Pressing it will stop playback and play iTunes music. Occasionally (once), it started working again for a moment, then stopped again. Often Apple watch can't control playback volume at all. Removing AirPods from my ears and reinserting may cause a Podcast to stop playing and Music to start, or it may not pause playback at all.\nTemporary Fix\nThe only way to fix this is to turn the phone off (hold sleep/wake and shut down) or hold home & sleep/wake. But within hours the problem returns. I am restarting my phone 5 times a day right now!\nI tried \"Reset All Settings\". No change.\nIn my searches for solutions I heard about a similar problem but it seems it was associated with a third party display and was fixed in the current update? I have the same or similar problem but no third party display and the latest iOS update is installed. All of the apps I use are up to date also.\nWhat else can I try?\nI tried posting this question on discussions.apple.com but I keep getting the unhelpful error message \"You are not allowed to create or update this content\". Infuriating!\n\nA: This is a bug that many ios 11.0 to 11.0.3 users are facing. On iOS 11.1 developer beta 5 however, it seems fixed. iOS 11.1 should be rolling out soon and it fixes this issue and many other battery issues. Until then, there isn't really any good solution. Hope this helps.\nOn iOS 11.1, if you still get the error, just back up and restore. That should work.\n\nA: *\n\n*Connect iPhone to iTunes.\n\n*Click \"Back Up Now\" and wait to complete.\n\n*Click \"Restore iPhone\" and follow the instructions.\n\n\nSeems obvious now! But I thought restoring a backup restored everything to the prior state (eg: not working), but the backup only includes your data, not the OS. So you can safely make a new backup even though you're having problems, then restore iPhone to factory, then restore the data from backup.

Let me try to describe the problem I'm facing as succinctly as possible\nJust this morning, when I'm unable to get any internet connection even though WiFi is connected (full strength).

When I boot into Windows, I'm able to get internet access through my home WiFi\n\n\nHow can I troubleshoot this to get to the root cause of the problem?\n\nA: You've provided great troubleshooting info, we can isolate the problem to being your Mac and not your router, we can isolate the problem to OSX and not your WiFi card, etc. \nI want to say it's an IP address problem. Maybe Windows has taken the IP address that your router gave your Mac's MAC address. I'd recommend going to system preferences --> Network. On the left column does WiFi say \"connected\" or \"self-assigned IP\" or something else? In the mean time, I'd recommend going to system preferences --> Network--> select WiFi on the left column --> click advanced on the bottom right --> TCP/IP tab --> Renew DHCP lease. \nIf this doesn't work, you can try on the WiFi tab (instead of TCP/IP), select your WiFi network and then click the minus (-) button to remove it, click OK, and try to reconnect to the WiFi network again. \nIf that doesn't work, you can hold option and click on the WiFi symbol on your menu bar (top right). Does your IP address look right? If you're not familiar with networking let me know what your IP address and router address are and we can go from there. \n", "Q: Why does Apple iCloud photosharing use googleapis.com? I found that my network monitor, Little Snitch, was blocking my Apple iCLoud photostream from my iphone to my Mac.  When I stopped the filter the photos were sharable. \nWhy does Apple iCloud photos use googleapis.com?  \n\nA: Why your device communicates with google is simple - it’s where the bits are stored (among other places).\nIt’s widely reported that Apple will encrypt and store iCloud data in anonymous fashion on several cloud platforms with Google cloud (GCF) joining Microsoft Azure and Amazon (AWS) as vendors to Apple. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/17/apple-icloud-google-cloud-platform/\n\n*https://www.computerworld.com/article/3045439/hybrid-cloud/apple-amazon-google-cloud-platform-itbwcw.html\n\n*http://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-hybrid-cloud-plan-google-aws-microsoft-azure-like-most-companies/\n\n*https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf\nThe last Apple link/pdf explicitly acknowledges Apple uses AWS and Azure. I haven’t seen an updated doc publicly confirming that google cloud is part of the mix, it you are correct in seeing the traffic go there by design. \n\nEach file is broken into chunks and encrypted by iCloud using AES-128 and a key derived from each chunk’s contents that utilizes SHA-256. The keys, and the file’s metadata, are stored by Apple in the user’s iCloud account. The encrypted chunks of the file are stored, without any user-identifying information, using third-party storage services, such as Amazon S3 and Windows Azure\n\nSo my reading is that Apple keeps the hashes and keys and identifiers in their own datacenters and on your device but then farms out bits of encrypted files all over the place so that they can keep the privacy and security promises made in the iOS security guide.\n", "Q: How to get the amount generated by app before deleting it from iTunes Connect I recently removed my app from sale from iTunes Connect, revenue generated from that app is around $103, I want to delete the app but before deleting how can I get this amount?\n\nA: The amount earned will be transferred into your bank account automatically without you having to do anything. However, when that happens will depend on a number of factors, such as whether you still have any others apps on the App Store and therefore still generate an income from them, etc.\nIf you have some concerns, or wish to just generally discuss this with someone, then contact the Apple Developer Program Support number for your country.

The answers to this question include suggestions for:\nQEMU\n\nQEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.\n\nQEMU can be installed from Homebrew: brew install qemu\nSkyeye\n\nSkyeye is a multi-architecture, multi-core, and highly scalable hardware simulation platform.

How does this command even work? I mean how does he know the right path? If I delete the script do I need to run another code? Delete the copied file from a hidden folder?\n\nA: chmod +x /path/to/file sets the execute permission on the file itself. It doesn't maintain a separate list of permissions for standard read/write/execute, just sets that to the file.\n\nAre these files copied to any hidden folder?\n\nNo, the file remains where it is. The permission is set to the file in place.\n\nHow does this command even work?\n\nPOSIX file permissions include read/write/execute permissions. Running +x adds the execute permission to all, -x removes it.\n\nHow does he know the right path?\n\nYou provide the path to the command when you run it. /path/to/file is the path you provided when you run the command.\n\nIf I delete the script do I need to run another code?\n\nYou can delete the file as usual, with rm or using Finder, without needing to run anything else. If you create a new file (regardless of the name) you will need to chmod +x /path/to/file to give it the execute permission again.\n\nDelete the copied file from a hidden folder?\n\nThere's no copying taking place when you run chmod so there's nothing else to delete.\n", "Q: App Store forcing me to pay twice for the same app but on different devices I bought a paid app on my iMac, and a few months later tried to download it on my iPhone but it’s forcing me to pay again for it. I thought the App Store linked purchases on multiple devices?\n\nA: Mac apps and iOS apps are completely separate.\nIf you purchase a Mac app, you can install it on any of your Macs. Likewise for an iOS app, which can be installed on any of your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch devices. Mac apps can't be run on an iOS device and vice versa — they are independent systems which link purchases independently.\n", "Q: cannot execute binary file I have a simple binary file needs to be executed.

Then I gave the command ./bclock and got the following error,\n-bash: ./bclock: cannot execute binary file\n\nAfter some research I though it has something to do with echo $PATH. Can someone help me out?\n\nA: The two common problems are that the permissions are wrong or the file is somehow corrupt.\nYou can add execute permission (or list them) with the two commands:\nchmod a+x ./bclock\nls -l ./bclock\n\nYou can check the file format as well to see if it's really executable or if it's a script or other type.\nfile ./bclock\n\n", "Q: Make Notification More Prominent Since I have a fairly large screen, I often miss appointments, even though Calendar showed a notification.

I want to play a prank with my friend in where I open a ssh connection with his Mac. I need SSH to be enabled on this Mac first, which requires admin rights. \nIs there any other I can enable SSH without sudo or an AppleScript?\n\nA: I would hope not since that would be a huge security vulnerability in the OS. Remote executable access without end user approval would be a highly exploitable vulnerability in the OS.\nThat being said, I wouldn't presume it's not possible but if it were possible, I would expect that to be a very closely guarded secret and not shared publicly. \nA \"white hat\" might disclose this to Apple, the vendor to fix and then announce.\nA \"black hat\" might develop the exploit and then sell it for millions of $$ or weaponize it for their nationality / social group of choice.\nAt this point, the definition of who is wearing the white/black hats is going to be highly controversial and subjective.

I'd like to move her to our family iCloud storage but want to make sure she doesn't lose any of her files in the change.\nDoes this change just effect the storage location of the information or would it delete any information she has in her cloud?\n\nA: No, your wife won't lose her files. Turning on Family Sharing simply adds the features to her iCloud account, which can include more data, and other features. She will see options on what of her iCloud data she wishes to share.\nWhen you leave a Family, your iCloud simply loses the Family sharing benefits, including shared apps, photos, etc. But the data doesn't get deleted, it remains unless you actually delete to make room.

What I don't understand though, is if they, after this, are saved there in a way that makes it completely safe for me to delete them from my camera roll (on my iPhone 6), without also losing them from iCloud drive. From what I have found online (online forums etc), this is not possible for \"regular\" iCloud, however I think all the threads I found were a bit old. An example of a thread I found: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7604440?start=0&tstart=0 \nI could not find any answers concerning iCloud drive.\nNote that I do not allow for my pictures to be automatically uploaded to iCloud/iCloud drive; they are only saved in my camera roll. If iCloud drive can work as its own storage, then I will choose which pictures I want to go there, and then delete them from my phone to free up some much needed space.\nHope someone can help me, I would be very thankful!! And when you answer, I would really appreciate it if you explained all the words, as I have very little knowledge about this stuff. For example, I have no idea what photo stream means (it came up once when I was searching this topic), so if that actually is a factor in this context, please explain it. I don't really understand the \"help\" pages on apple's homepage..\n\nA: iCloud Drive is just a way to sync photos and other files between all your iOS devices and computers (both Mac and PC). iCloud does not function as a standalone Cloud storage service, hence if you delete photos from your iPhone they will also be deleted from iCloud Drive. \nYou can however upload your photos to other Cloud services like Dropbox, or simply transfer the photos to your computer (i.e. into another folder or import them into photo management software such as the Photos app on macOS), and then delete them from your phone and these photos will still remain on your computer or Dropbox. \n\nA: One word: YES\nTo get to get down to your question, it is important to understand how iCloud storage works - whether you upgrade to a paid storage plan or not, iCloud works the same: the storage is shared among all applications and services using iCloud.\nNow, currently there are four ways to store your photos to different services of iCloud and they are all independent. Image duplicates (if any) in all four positions are managed separately.\niCloud Photo Library. (This is what you call ”iCloud” in the question)\n\n\n*\n\n*Camera roll is merged with and replaced as iCloud Photo Library under this method.\n\n*It takes up iCloud storage space. \n\n*It has nothing to do with iCloud Drive.\n\n*Photos stored in iCloud Drive will not show up in Photos app — unlike Dropbox or OneDrive, whose apps list all your photos on the cloud drive.\n\n*The original image files are stored in the cloud, and you can choose if your device downloads and stores the originals or compressed (“optimized”) ones. \n\n*Photos are only accessible from Photos app on any device. (Or in Finder on Mac as how the file system works) Photos are not accessible from iCloud Drive (the Files app on iOS, and the iCloud Drive tab in Finder).\n\n*Photos can only be deleted from Photos app on any of your device or on iCloud.com. If you have previously stored duplicates of photos to iCloud Drive (eg. by using action sheet in iOS to add them to iCloud Drive), they are not affected.\niCloud Drive. (now inside Files app in iOS 11)\n\n\n*\n\n*It has nothing to do with iCloud Photo Library.\n\n*It works pretty much like a remote disk. It does not have the feature to auto upload photos from Photos app (your camera roll, etc). You have to add (save) photos to it so that it will upload them to the cloud, just as adding regular files.\n\n*It uses the iCloud storage space as well. \n\n*The image files, just like all other files in any cloud drive products, are stored in the cloud and can be downloaded to any device. \n\n*If you select some photos from Photos app (whether it is in your camera roll or other position) and save (export) them to iCloud Drive, you will have your photos in two separate and unrelated positions. Therefore, deleting or modifying the image files in iCloud Drive will not delete the images in Photos — but the photos are deleted everywhere on iCloud Drive.\niCloud Photo Sharing (aka. Shared iCloud Photo Stream)\n\n\n*\n\n*It does not take up iCloud storage space. \n\n*It stores your photos forever. \n\n*It is basically Apple’s Instagram, but only with friends and family. \n\n*It compresses images and videos and even converts their formats. Go to Apple website for details. \n\n\niCloud Photo Stream\n\n\n*\n\n*Depricated, or at least old-fashioned. \n\n*It does not take up iCloud storage space. \n\n*As the name suggests, it acts as a stream, an intermediate. It does not store photos forever (unlike the other three). Go to Apple website for more info. \n\n", "Q: How Can I Stop My Mac From Reopening Applications After A Power Failure?

I have an iPhone 8 and so far it’s been great, except for one thing. I was sure that the iPhone 8 supported fast charging, like up to 80% or something. but I barely notice much difference in terms of how quick it gets a charge compared to my iPhone 6s. I’ve checked Settings/Battery and tried Low Power Mode when on charge but that made no difference either. I looked elsewhere in Settings but didn’t see anything I can change to make it fast charge. So now I question myself and wonder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Was I wrong about the whole fast charging thing?\n\n*Is it only the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, or maybe just the iPhone X that supports fast charging?\n\n*Or is there just something I have to do to get it to fast charge?\n\n\nYour assistance would be great!\n\nA: Yes, all of this year's newly released iPhones (8, 8 Plus and X) support fast charging. And no, there’s no setting you need to enable for it to work.\nAnd, just to clarify, by fast charging you can recharge your iPhone up to 50% (not 80%) within the first 30 minutes.\nHowever, for fast charging to work you need to use a charger that provides enough power for it to fast charge, and the chargers bundled with your iPhone only deliver 5 watts of power at up to 1 amp. By way of example, an iPad charger delivers 12 watts of power at up to 2.1 amps. Note: I am not saying that an iPad charger will fast charge your iPhone 8, although it would certainly charge it quicker than the standard iPhone charger.\nInstead, I refer to what Apple says you need for fast charging your iPhone:\n\nFast charging gives you a quick and convenient way to recharge your\n  iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus. Your iPhone fast charges up to 50 percent\n  in 30 minutes when you use an Apple USB-C to Lightning cable and one\n  of these adapters:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Apple 29W, 61W, or 87W USB-C Power Adapter\n  \n*A comparable third-party USB-C power adapter that supports USB Power Delivery (USB-PD)\n  \n\nFor more info refer to: Fast charge your iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus.\n\nA: With a fast charger, you charge your Apple iPad/iPhone faster ( USB-C 18 W chargers minimum) than with a regular charger.

If i need to charge them, the second time i turn them on, i have to do the same process again, is there a way to make this the default behavior?? \nBTW, i'm using High Sierra\n\nA: create an aggregate device via audio midi setup and do not include the your headset input channel in there, then make that device to be default.\nthat's an example setup, as long as you do not include your headphones input and use the build-in microphone, it should not trigger the SCO codec upon bluetooth initialisation. that generally means if you want to listen to music and talk it will use the laptop microphone, not the headset one.\nhope that helps.\n", "Q: Why is my wired keyboard's Eject key no longer working after OS upgrade? Though it sounds like a duplicate of this question, it isn't; the difference is that my eject key works when I connect it to another Mac, so the hardware is good.\nThe situation is that I have a MacPro3,1 tower with an optical drive that I recently upgraded to El Capitan. The eject key always worked before, but after the move to El Capitan it no longer works and I either have to use the menu bar command or press the physical button on the drive (it is an aftermarket BD-ROM from MacSales).\nThe keyboard is directly connected to the Mac, no USB hubs or anything in the middle. I have not changed any settings for Fn keys. I do have Karabiner installed to re-map the right-option key for Citrix sessions, but using its \"display all keyboard events\" tool, it seems that the eject key has no event associated with it. I would have thought this meant it is a hardware issue, but seeing how it worked with no problem on my other Mac, I'm guessing the key isn't mapped like the rest.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: In response to Allan's comments on the original question, I attempted safe mode and found that the eject key still worked and also realized that it worked before I logged in to my account. Obviously, it was something my profile was loading at login time.\nWhile I'm not sure which item specifically helped, I did notice that I had an older \"iTunes Helper\" and also quitting iTunes (which is normally loaded all the time) did seem to correspond with the eject key working again, but I'm not 100% convinced that it was the precise culprit. While iTunes has always had a helper, I think this particular one might have been an artifact of an older installation that got carried over in the upgrade and caused the problem.\n", "Q: How do I display stop, pause, play and rewind audio file controls on my iMac? How do I display stop, pause, play and rewind audio file controls on my iMac?\nI can see my volume control no problem. I can't see or find any controls which will allow me to play an audio (voice) file and then pause, rewind, advance, stop, or play the file. Once started the voice file continuously plays without control - except the volume!\nDoes such a rare and complicated device as an audio control set-up actually exist on a Mac? If not, where do I go to obtain this ability?\nOnline searches happily tell me all about video controls. Not what I want!\n\nA: There is nothing specifically built in to the macOS that allow the keyboard to control audio file (Music, voice notes, etc.) on the Mac.\nNormally music and voice notes sync with and play in iTunes. And in iTunes you can select a song and tap the spacebar to play and pause but to move back and forth in the song or audio file you must use your mouse to move around in the file by clicking before or after the moving play indicator. You can also drag the play indicator back and forth to control where you want to play from.\nBut neither iTunes nor Quicktime player (seem to) allow the keyboard to control skipping forward or backwards in a song or other audio file.\nIf that does not answer your question you may need to give us a specific use case and how you would like to control playback. There are quite a number of audio playback and editing applications out there and they all have different controls.\n", "Q: Can you blindly navigate the boot selector screen with a non-flashed video card? I have a Mac Pro with a non-flashed video card. Yes, the video works just fine when the machine is booted (HD 270x). Since the card is not flashed, I obviously cannot see the boot screen.\nThe problem I have is that I also have Boot Camp on the machine for a Windows 7 installation. I used to simply have a simple Automator generated application for blessing the BOOTCAMP partition and rebooting the machine. However, with the upgrade to El Capitan and the associated System Integrity Protection (SIP) you can no longer simply bless the partition and thus my application no longer works without disabling SIP.\nI'd prefer to have SIP enabled, so short of finding an EFI ROM for the Radeon HD 270X (automatic answer accept if you have one! ;-)) I figure I could live out my days navigating the boot screen in the dark.. what, two right-arrow keys and a 'return' wait a few mins? Should be easy, no? Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work and instead appears to get stuck to the point that I need to reboot AND zap the PRAM to get back to normal!\nMy question is, am I just mis-navigating the boot screen and the PRAM zapping is just because somehow I messed up? Or is it that telling the Mac to go to the boot screen (Option key during startup) got it stuck somehow because it didn't see a video card it could use? Better yet, is there another way I can still use Boot Camp with a non-flashed PC video card?\nthanks\n\nA: \nBetter yet, is there another way I can still use Boot Camp with a non-flashed PC video card?\n\nWhenever you want to reboot into Bootcamp, open System Preferences and then the Startup Disk preference Pane. Select your bootcamp partition from the list, and then hit restart.\nYour computer will automatically reboot into Bootcamp. This setting only affects the next reboot, which means that whenever you're done in Windows, you can reboot normally to get back to macOS X.\nYou can expedite this process slightly by creating a shortcut to the Startup Disk preference pane.\n", "Q: Photos app (iPhoto) hangs when trying to open Ive got a mac mini running OSX 10.10.5.

Is there a way to call up all 3 email addresses using a single contact? This would save me searching for and selecting each individual every time I send an email.\nThank you in advance for any helpful direction provided by a sympathetic technology-savvy person, I am in your debt.\nYours gratefully\nSid\n\nA: You can create email or contact based groups with those contacts using the stock Mail app. But you will need iCloud on the web to make those groups.\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, you need to make sure your contacts are being backed\nup in iCloud. Go to Settings > 'Mail, Contacts, Calendars' and\nselect iCloud from the Account at the top. make sure Contacts has a\ngreen slider next to it.\n\n*Now log into www.icloud.com using your Apple ID, and select Contacts.\n\n*You'll see all the contacts from your iPhone presented in a list. Click the + icon at the bottom of the lefthand pane. Select New Group.\n\n*The new group, called Untitled Group 1 for the time being, appears in the lefthand column below All Contacts. Name the group and click outside the box to save it. (If you change your mind and decide to delete a group, you need to make sure the group is highlighted and then click the cog icon at the bottom left and click Delete.)\n\n*Go back to the All Contacts group and decide who you want to add to your new group. You can add contacts individually by dragging-and-dropping their names on to the new group.\nIf you want to remove a name from a group, you need to be in the group, with the name of the group highlighted, and the name of the soon-to-be-removed contact highlighted too. Then click the cog and select Delete. This will just remove the name from the group (with no warning popup, incidentally), rather than deleting it from your contacts entirely. You'll know if you've got this wrong, because it you tell iCloud to delete a contact completely you will get a warning and have to select Delete a second time to confirm this.)\n\n*You can batch-add contacts to speed up the process. Click and hold the Command button (also known as the Apple button) and then click each contact you want to add, in turn. These will all be selected simultaneously. (If you get one wrong, click it again to remove it from the selection.) Now release Command and click-and-drag any one of the highlighted names on to the new group, and the other selected names will be brought along for the ride. For really fast adding, you can hold down Shift instead of Command, then click on two names. iCloud will select every contact that sits between the two alphabetically.\n\n*Close down the tab with iCloud in and open up your iPhone. Launch Contacts, and tap Groups at the top left of the screen. The new group will be listed under iCloud. By default all of the groups on the screen will be ticked, but if you tap the new group's name all the other groups will be untucked, leaving just the new one. Now tap done, and you'll see a list of contacts in the new group. (In our experience the new group appears almost instantaneously, provided you've got an internet connection. There's isn't a significant syncing delay.)\n\n*You can now send an email to the whole group very easily. Open Mail and create a new message. In the To field, start typing the name of the group, and iOS will offer it as a suggestion. Tap the group (labelled, in our experience, as just 'Group', rather than its full name) to insert all the email addresses as recipients. You can remove recipients individually if you want to send an email to most of the members of a group.\n\n\n\nThere is a way of creating an email group on the iPhone itself, but it's a bit of a fudge - effectively you're creating a new contact which has multiple email addresses crammed together.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Contacts app.\n\n*Tap the Add (+) icon.\n\n*Enter the name of the group (such as \"friends\" or \"work\") in the Last field.\n\n*Scroll down to the Notes section. We're going to use this to write out the email addresses. You need to surround each mail address with greater than and less than symbols and place a comma between each one. For example , .\n\n*Tap and hold the names to bring up the contextual menu. Tap Select All and Copy.\n\n*Tap Add Email.\n\n*Tap and hold the Email field and tap Paste.\n\n\nThat now creates a contact with a single name but multiple email addresses. Open the Mail app and tap New. Now enter the name of the group into the To field. It will turn blue, indicating that it is a contact. When you send the email it will go to all the people whose email addresses you added to Contacts.\nSource and images for both solutions: MacWorld\n", "Q: Why these \"Earlier\" shown in Finder's column title for one of my NFS mounts?

That worked fine, or so I thought - the phone is now in an endless reboot loop.\nNow, I will not take \"bricked\" for an answer.

I can get it into recovery mode, however since the reboot loop began iTunes hasn't been able to recognize it, and so I'm not sure if I'm successfully getting it into DFU mode.  (Strangely, the process is to hold power+home for 10 seconds, then release power and keep holding home for 10 seconds, but at the same time, the process to hard-reset an iPhone you hold power+home for 6 seconds.  I'm not sure if the hard reset is always part of getting the phone into DFU mode, but it's definitely hard resetting, and iTunes is not reporting a phone in DFU mode.)\nEDIT: In case u r wondering, I did not steal this phone.  Here is a picture of some facebook message history that I obviously doctored should prove it.\nEDIT 2: Just saw this question, will try.\n\nA: EDIT 2 was indeed the answer.

These tasks, at least in macOS, are heavy GPU dependent. Upgrading your hardware should take care of any UI issues.\nThe following video demonstrates how the UI is more fluid:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/o9Vw2Cn.mp4\nGreetings to @bmike\n\nA: That response looks entirely proper and the only thing I could see would be to have chrome somehow do less calculation of the content inside the frame and just resize the window and redraw / re-layout the text and content at a lower rate.\nThis seems like an intentional tradeoff - you can see the content is responding almost as fast as the mouse pointer. I'm not up on css / html enough to know if there's a hint you could embed to tell the web layout to not worry about layout changes so much and instead wait for you to pick a window size and then refresh.\nMy guess is the software isn't optimized for your use case at all. If chrome and safari and Firefox all work the same, you might simply see a decision to use CPU and cap frame rates due to energy consumption considerations and not for inherent limitations in the hardware. It could also be that all the responsiveness and resources are committed to making the content move inside the window so you know you are dragging and less about trying to track a window size change.\nDissecting this would make for an interesting research project or possibly a thesis for someone on software design tradeoffs and implementations.

Will it electrocute me if I accidentally touch those little wires inside the rubber wrap?\n\nA: Can you get electrocuted?\nIt depends on which side of the adapter.\nIf it's on the \"mains\" side (below left image) you could potentially be hit with a 110V or 220V (AC) electrical charge (US, Canada and the rest of the world respectively).  There is enough voltage and amperes here to electrocute you.\n\n\nIf it's on the cable on the MagSafe side (above right image), then you are only dealing with voltage of no more than 18V (DC).  You will get a shock, but it won't be dangerous except in three cases: \n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a a pacemaker or other medical device or heart condition - any electricity could in rare circumstances cause you problems - check with your doctor on this.\n\n*Fire risk - the frayed cord and current levels are enough to start a fire in the right circumstances.\n\n*If the transformer section that separates the high and low voltage size is compromised or broken then the high voltage could get past into the low voltage side. On Apple products this is basically unheard of due to multiple failsafe, monitoring and the design and manufacture of the adapter. Third party knock off adapters - some of these fail and are criminal negligence-level bad and unsafe.\n\n\nThe bottom line - An Apple genuine power adapter with a damaged and exposed wire should be fixed but isn't a safety hazard.  Get it fixed  to prevent serious damage to electronic components or starting a fire as opposed to getting electrocuted.\n\nA: Here is an image of a magsafe connector, with the two wires used: note that the shielding is the second conductor. The black heat shrink was used to try to repair it - but I decided to make one out of two and not use this end...\nThis was to make sure that it is understood that the cable does not have a V+ and V- inside the shield braid, in this design the shield braid IS the V-.\n\n\nA: When I have exposed wires like that, I dab a bit of silicone sealant on the exposed part and let it dry thoroughly before using it.  (Avoid \"Type 2\" silicone.)  A few thin layers works better than one thick one.\nOf course, if two or more wires are exposed, never let them touch -- coat each one separately, then put them together after the (sufficiently thick) insulation is dry.\n", "Q: iPhone6 running iOS 11 is eating my battery My iPhone 6 recently got updated with iOS11.

As a result, I have noticed that the temperature increases to around 100 C during the startup time (I have checked this right after login through Istat Menus). Meanwhile the fans are at 2000 rps. Apparently , the reason why fans do not speed up is because the system as a whole is within the safe temp with the only exception of the CPU temperature as CPU is busy processing all those startup processes. So the fans assume everything is alright and do not speed up.\nNow my question is if this causes any harm to CPU as I think I read somewhere that quick fluctuations within a short range in the temp of CPU can cause damage to the CPU. I just wanted to know your ideas on this.\n\nA: In iStat Menus, check the figure for 'relative to ProcHot' - so long as this is a positive value, all is OK in theory, though I would have expected the fans to ramp before that temperature was reached.\nMaybe try resetting the NVRAM & SMC - Really confused about how to reset SMC and PRAM and NVRAM on my Macs and iPad and iPhone? has a comprehensive answer on how to do this for all Mac models.\nPicture of where is shows on my machine, but as it's a dual processor Mac Pro no doubt it will look very different. [bottom half menu cropped off, to save space]\n\n\nA: \nNow my question is if [the CPU being hot versus the average temp of the reset of the MacBook] causes any harm to CPU as I think I read\n  somewhere that quick fluctuations within a short range in the temp of\n  CPU can cause damage to the CPU.\n\nNo.\nYour MacBook will do multiple things to address the CPU temp from throttling (kernel_task process) the CPU to spinning up the fans (provided you don't have another program overriding the fans' operation).\nThis has already been addressed on this site:  kernel_task hundreds of % CPU yet cpu frequency is being lowered\nIf your CPU goes past its temperature threshold, it will shut itself down (outside the influence of the OS) in a process aptly named \"thermal shutdown.\"\n\nApparently , the reason why fans do not speed up is because the system\n  as a whole is within the safe temp with the only exception of the CPU\n  temperature as CPU is busy processing all those startup processes. So\n  the fans assume everything is alright and do not speed up.\n\nThe fans assume nothing.  They also don't operate on the basis of an mean system temperature.  If it (SMC) sees the CPU is too hot and/or under load, the SMC will spin them up unless something (like SMCFanControl) is overriding the default behavior.  \nIf you've ever looked inside a MacBook Pro, the fan which is attached the heatsink covers only two components - the CPU and, the GPU. The SMC isn't going to try to cool the CPU with a fan directly attached to it by waiting until the other temperatures spike.\n\nInstead of looking at iStat, it would be more beneficial to look at Activity Monitor to see what the CPU is doing.  Try running in Safe Mode (hold Shift while booting) Recovery Mode, or booting from an external disk with El Capitan or Sierra installed.  If the problem goes away, the issue is with High Sierra, not your MacBook. \n", "Q: Where are the temporary passwords located on mac When I try to access my Mac Pro Desktop from my MacBook Pro, it doesn't let me connect to Mac Pro anymore , I think I've changed the password without ticking the box: \"Remember this password in my keychain\" \nThe problem is, I cannot find the password in order to connect to Mac Pro Desktop.\nI have researched this problem on the forum and have looked at my keychains, on which no item exists relating to this problem. I also created a test account on the Mac Pro Desktop  and tried to connect to the  Mac Pro Desktop as a registered user, but that user name and password was also deemed invalid.\nDoes anyone know where the passwords which are not saved where they are stored on a Mac or  creating a new password or making the Mac Pro Desktop to see the MacBook Pro  as a new Machine?\n\nA: When you don't check the ‘Remember this password in my keychain’ box, that's not to say the password is remembered somewhere else, but rather that the password isn't remembered at all.\nI'm inclined to believe the problem is elsewhere. This is exemplified by the inability to connect using a completely new account.\n", "Q: Moving just MacOS from HDD to SSD I have an iMac with a fusion drive. A while back, the drive separated into two seperate drives, with one OS on both the SSD and HDD each. The Apple Technician was unable to help me to join them again into a single fusion drive over the phone, and so I gave up and just used the OS on the HDD, while rarely using the speedy SSD for importing and rendering video only. However, the 3TB HDD is nearly full, and thus is running incredibly slow - almost unusable.  Is there any way for me to delete the unused OS from the SSD, and move just the OS from the HDD to the SSD, while still leaving the data on the HDD. I have 2.8 TB worth of data on the HDD, and only 200 GB free on the SSD, so is there a way to move just the System OS to the faster drive, while leaving all of the data on the HDD without merging them into a Fusion Drive again?\n\nA: No - that won't be easy at all but it's exactly what Fusion Drive was engineered to do.\nWhat would be easy is to make a backup of all the files you care about - preferably using Time Machine and a second clone copy if you're not sure Time Machine will work for all your files as a just in case.\nThen delete about 30 GB of space so you have room to get a clean installer and make a bootable install drive with the OS of your choice.\nWhen you boot from that installer - the trick will be wiping both the SSD and HDD entirely - then getting it back into Fusion Drive configuration.\nNow that you have an OS and user data on Fusion arrangement - loading from your backup (either in the Migration Assistant portion of the new OS setup or running Migration Assistant) would get you the SSD boost without having to implement your own dual tier storage system.\nSince most of these specific tasks are already asked / answered here and would be far too long for one answer - here's the outline and I'll try to link to detailed questions on each:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup via Time Machine \n\n*Optional backup using a clone (Disk Utility / Carbon Copy Cloner / Super duper)\n\n*Clear space so you have 30 GB free\n\n*Download the OS installer you want \n\n*Make a bootable USB installer drive\n\n*Boot from the installer (or Internet Recovery) and erase SSD and HDD entirely\n\n*Then form an SSD/HDD Fusion Drive before installing the OS\n\n*Install the OS on Fusion Drive\n\n*Restore files from the backup\n\n", "Q: How can I disable the \"No Backups for x Days\" from Time Machine? Since I updated to High Sierra, I frequently get the \"No Backups for x Days\" notification. I used to be able to make this go away by turning off Time Machine in the System Preferences until I needed it, but there is no way to turn Time Machine off anymore. How can I get rid of these notifications?\n\nA: For macOS 12 and earlier (pre-Ventura):\nIn the Time Machine preferences, you have to right-click on the drive icon and then select \"Stop Using {Drive Name} for Backup\".\n\nFor macOS 13 and later:\nIn Time Machine settings page, select the drive icon and click the [-] button at the bottom of the list.\n\n\nA: I suggest you get TimeMachineEditor and set your backup schedule to once a week or some time period you find more suitable. This app overrides the hourly backup default schedule of Time Machine and lets you define time periods to prohibit backups.  \n", "Q: Verifying third party apps doesn't do anything When I get a third party app it says it needs to be verified before I can use it but when I go to settings to verify I tap verify and nothing happens. Is there something I can do so I don’t have to constantly reinstall my apps? \n\n\nA: It sounds like you're trying to run illegal copies of apps (or more precisely - enterprise signed apps when the membership of the enterprise isn't at all what Apple intended). \nTapping Verify like you do is the correct way to verify apps and will check / log information that Apple uses presumably to decide to contact that Enterprise if they are indeed in violation of their agreement with Apple. \nIf nothing happens, it's almost certainly due to Apple revoking the developer certificate because it's been used to distribute apps illegally or without a license or with a certificate issued for other purposes.\n\nA: In this case you are using apps that contains modified versions of App Store apps and free versions of paid AppStore apps, I am assuming that by you’re comments you are downloading apps from TweakBox, which uses a configuration profile so that it doesn’t expire\n", "Q: AppleID can I transfer data without using the same one? I don't want to use the same Apple ID on my new phone as on my old phone because it got messed up, however I don't want to have to buy each app twice. Is there a way I can without using the same Apple ID? Same goes for music.\n\nA: You can use your old Apple ID to sign in to in the App Store, and use your new ID for everything else on your phone. Just set up the phone using the new ID, then go to “iTunes & App Store” in Settings, log out of the App Store, and log back in using your old ID.

But when I look at Downloads folder, it looks different from other downloads. It has a small x icon on corner:\n\nWhy?\n\nA: The little circled (x), on the icon, is to stop the download. While it shows the reported download size, nonetheless it appears the download hasn't competed yet, and or if the downloading has stopped then something may be wrong and why it hasn't completed.\n", "Q: Atom code editor typing lag I am using Atom on 2016 MBP with these specs:\nOS: High Sierra\nProcessor: Intel Core i5\nProcessor Speed:  2.9 GHz\nTotal Number of Cores: 2\nMemory:   8 GB\nUntil recently Atom was working fine, but then Atom started lagging when I typed a key and would often not display the letters I typed until 5-10 seconds later. This happened multiple times. I tried starting up in safe mode (I think thats what it is called) and that did not fix this. Once when this happened I opened activity monitor and a strangely large amount of RAM was being used. Here are some pictures:\nThe apps that I had open\n\nA picture of the activity monitor\n\nIs there a reason why there is this lag?\n\nA: Atom has some known issues with performance.  They've been working on them, and are getting better, but they are still there.  Until they get better performance, I'd recommend using Visual Studio Code (Free, also based on the Electron framework, but tends to perform [a little bit] better than Atom all around) or, if you want the fastest, then Sublime Text is about as good as you get in a GUI text editor, though it'll set you back $80.\nThere are numerous other text editors out there, all with their own pros and cons, and it really depends on what kind of development you're doing. PHPStorm, for example, has some really nice PHP-specific dev tools that are harder to set up in other editors.\nAs a full-stack dev, (I use Vue for front-end work, and Node.js / PHP for the backend) I've settled on VSC for now, until Atom catches up speed-wise.  I get a lot of flak from friends about using a Microsoft product on my Mac, but I am a firm believer in getting things done with the best tool for the job.  Currently, for my needs, that's Microsoft's editor running on a Mac.\n", "Q: Why are jpeg & pdf documents being covered with solid black rectangles? There are specific pages of legal documents that I scanned myself as jpegs then combined in a pdf yesterday and they looked great. I downloaded it back from iCloud and they show up in the application for maybe 0 to 1 frames before a black rectangle covers up all the information in the document. Then I opened some jpegs that have been only on my computer since scanned, and they get the same censoring effect. I think I'll make up the term dynamically redacted since the redacting is being done by the application when displaying the otherwise non-redacted file. For further evidence as requested by a commenter, I also moved the file that Preview was redacting into iCloud to test it with my iPhone and was able to view the file normally with the iPhone. \nHere is the problem occurring in Preview with a local pdf document.\n\nHere is the problem occurring in Finder with local jpeg files.\n\nHere is an example depicting more concretely a comparison that the documents are being observed sometimes normally and sometimes they are censored. When I attempted to take this final image with grab it refused when I selected Preview as a window and said that \"the contents cannot be shared.\"\n\nSo far, I've noticed that the censoring affects Preview and Finder so it must be an Apple system-wide protocol. Grab probably is just inheriting the message from the window that it tries to grab from. \nUpdate\nIt may be interesting to point out that the pages that are redacted are exactly the ones which I scanned using the document feeder and not the ones using the flatbed of the scanner. So, it could be possible that the scanner is somehow setting a setting for the pdf files based on how they are scanned. The scanner was a Brother MFC-7460DN\nUpdate 2\nIt appears as though I found the culprit setting. Notice that the infos with color show the preview image while the ones set to grey do not. This fact applies to the other examples as well. Apparently, it is simply how the applications handle previewing greyscale images vs. color. \n\n\nA: It is a result of how Apple implemented the display for Preview and Finder which depends on whether the jpeg or pdf has the property of being a color image or greyscale image.\n\n", "Q: Finder can't authenticate even though I am the admin I am trying to authenticate but it seems that my approach is not working. I am logged into the administrator account, so I obviously know the admin password, but I can't authenticate in Finder or any other place that requires unlock.\nI am running the latest macOS High Sierra.\n\nThis is a proof that I am the Admin.\n\n\n\nA: Based on the list of accounts, it appears to be that you're not an admin and there is no admin account on your computer.

When I click on the viewer icon I want to open the one I used last. (Sometimes I minimize a window just for a second to do some quick action on some other app). However, clicking on a deck icon never opens the latest instance. Instead it always opens the first instance, (something which I didn't look at in hours), which just doesn't make sense. How can I change that?\nThe same problem appears to multiple instances in other apps.\n\nA: If you minimise a window but have another window from the app still open, clicking on the Dock icon brings the older window to the front because that's the one that's open. If you want the minimised window, click the minimised window in the Dock, not the app icon.\n", "Q: How much does Apple Pay really cost for person to person transactions? In this YouTube video, Craig Federighi said that person-to-person transactions via Apple Pay cost no money if the user had a debit card.\nIt is hard to believe that for service and background processes they do not charge a penny. Is there any hidden cost?\n\nA: It's the same as Venmo, zero for debit, 3% for credit.  Nothing hidden.\n", "Q: No way to send a text message I have updated to the new 10.0 and now my message screen only shows my messages and an edit option.

I'm doing a project for school and it involves running a java program which sometimes crashes. In order to kill the unresponsive program, I'll go to my dock, right click on the program and press \"Force Quit\":\n\nThe program it kills has a window with a title \"Planet Wars Visualizer\", and the top menu for the program in the top left says \"CLViewer\":\n\nInstead of having to press \"Force Quit\" every time, I want to just use the killall <name> command. However, when I go to my activity monitor I don't see any processes with the names \"Java\", \"Planet Wars Visualizer\", or \"CLViewer\". Even when I try killall with those names I just get No matching processes belonging to you were found.\nHow can I find out the actual name of the process just by the clues I have?\n\nA: When the program goes unresponsive, open Activity Monitor and see if a process is followed by a message in red which says unresponsive. You can get the name of the process from there.\n\nA: Use the pkill command.\nFrom the man page (man pkill)\n\nThe pkill command searches the process table on the running system and\n  signals all processes that match the criteria given on the command\n  line.\n\nBefore issuing the pkill command, it's useful to test it out by using the pgrep command first (from man page:  \"find or signal processes by name\").\nOnce you are certain that pgrep is finding the processes you are interested in killing, issue the pkill command.\n", "Q: The only thing I can do on my iPhone 6 is make calls Today I was in a bike accident.

On macOS I have my photos manually organised into folders within the main \"Pictures\" folder; I don't use Photos or any kind of picture management app.\nIf I turn in iCloud storage for Photos will it preserve that folder structure in \"Pictures\"? Or does it all need to be managed by the Photos app in order to sync to iCloud?\n\nA: It turns out that pictures on iCloud work with the Photos app; photos are \"special\" and you don't sync the Pictures folder in the same way items on iCloud drive are synced. In order to sync photos to iCloud you need to use the Photos app and copy when importing. If you import photos in-place from an unmanaged location they will not be synced to iCloud.\n\nA: The application works only with photos saved on iPhotos\n", "Q: iTerm2 number conversion I right-clicked on a number, and iTerm2 shows me the number conversion in hex. But what is the 168.64 Ki number? What does Ki denote?\n\n\nA: Short answer\nKi refers to the binary prefix kibi which denotes 210, or a value of 1,024. For more info refer to the Kibibyte article on Wikipedia.\nLong answer\nAt first glance I thought this was referring to Kilobytes as in KB and not kB, because there’s an old convention since the 1970s that we use kB for 1,000 Bytes and KB for 1,024 Bytes.\nSo, what the iTerm2 conversion seemed to be doing was assuming that the 172,688 figure referred to bytes and therefore it was basically equivalent to 168.64 KB (i.e. 168.64 x 1,024). \nHowever, upon reading the 'Kilobyte' article on Wikipedia and referring to the additional 'See also' articles, it appears that iTerm2 is using the symbol for Kibi (which itself is shortened for kilobinary, a term originally proposed in 1995 to denote a value of 1,024). \nThe International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) after consultation with the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published a number of standards during the period 1999 to 2012. According to the BIPM standard JCGM 200:2012 \"International vocabulary of metrology – Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM), 3rd edition\"\n\nSI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10, and should not be used for powers of 2. For example, 1 kilobit should not be used to represent 1024 bits (210 bits), which is 1 kibibit. \n\nThe following table lists specific units, names, symbols etc:\n\nSource: Wikipedia\nSo, while the value of a kibi (Ki) is 1,024, it is not necessarily representative of a Kilobyte (which represents 1,024 Bytes), because it can also refer to 1,024 of something else.\n", "Q: How do I launch an application with a specific JDK?

It involves installing Java 1.6 (as you've done) and manually updating a library file, libjogl_awt.jnilib. However that article says the issue occurs when \"[upgrading] to High Sierra\", so this might not be what's causing your issue if you're still running Sierra.\n\nA: Have you tried uninstalling Java 7?

Haven't had much luck, just large numbers of people converting .heic files to .jpg, and the Nokia JS viewer on GitHub\nTo start, I am not looking to convert my existing Photo Library all to HEVC encoded .heic files, there's diminishing returns to be had there since they're already jpegged and have had quality loss from the original.\nSo this question is not a duplicate of the \"Convert whole library to new .HEIC format\" question\nMy goal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take both a mpeg bytestream and a PNG or JPG bytestream and pack them into a .heic file\n\n*Take multiple PNG and/or JPG bytestreams and make a .heic file of them (like a burst series of photos)\nHEIF is just a container, so while it was designed for HEVC use, it does support other data types like jpg, png, pretty much anything that the viewing applications support in their natives file formats.\nI just haven't been able to find any software that will let me do it. Everything I search for to do with HEIF or HEIC in the term just pumps me with tech news headlines about Apple trying to replace jpeg, and people converting their .heic files once their imported from their computer (which seems like it would take effort to do since iOS defaultly will convert them for you if you try to import them or share them anywhere it can't explicitly confirm the reaching end supports them...)\nSo I'm hoping someone here knows a thing or two and could point me in the right direction at least.\nI'm not adverse to command line tools, or even doing some development myself if I can get pointed at a library I can import into a Swift application (I'm a late bloomer in programming, and while I could say the same for Javascript, if I was to build an app around a library to do this work, I'd much rather use Swift than use a scripting language)\nSo hopefully someone has thought the same thing and had better luck than me finding this! :)\nEdit 1, Nov 10:\nI've found a site by a bloke called Ben Gotow that talks about converting existing JPEGs into HEVC bitstreams, and then putting them into a .heic or .heif container. It's close, but he hadn't been able to find a lot of detail for doing more than that.

GPAC is used for research and academic purposes and beyond through industrial collaborations! The project covers different aspects of multimedia, with a focus on presentation technologies (graphics, animation and interactivity) and on multimedia packaging formats such as MP4.\n\nMore details:\n\n*\n\n*Compare and convert HEIF, JPEG and WebP images with rokka\n\n*GPAC support for HEIF.\n\nA little more research and an answer here provides the way!\nWe need several things installed, ideally with homebrew:\n\n*\n\n*x265 and GPAC\nbrew install x265 gpac\n\n\n*FFmpeg with x265 support\nbrew install ffmpeg --with-fdk-aac --with-ffplay --with-freetype --with-libass --with-libquvi --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opus --with-x265\n\nReference\nNow that you have the tools, try a script like this to convert images in a folder to HEIF/HEIC:\nfor F in *.jpg *.png *.tif *.tiff; \\\n  do ffmpeg -i \"$F\" -crf 23 -vf \"scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2\" -preset slower -pix_fmt yuv420p -f hevc \"${F%.*}.hvc\" && \\\n     MP4Box -add-image \"${F%.*}.hvc\" -ab heic -new \"${F%.*}.heic\" && \\\n     rm \"${F%.*}.hvc\";\n  done;\n\nI tried it with a folder of images and it works. It turns images with odd dimensions to even dimensions, for instance, but besides a few caveats it works.\n\nA: Install ImageMagick and use basic convert format to go from one format to another.\nI know this is an old thread, but posting my two cents that in 2020 it is far easier to bulk convert images to HEIC nowadays than it was in the past.\nThe first step is to get ImageMagick and ExifTool installed via Homebrew like this:\nbrew install imagemagick exiftool\n\nOnce you have ImageMagick installed, converting to HEIC is as simple as this:\nconvert image.jpg image.heic\n\nThat’s it! ImageMagick converts files from one format to another based the file extension of the destination file. And all metadata from the source file is cleanly transferred from the old file to the new file by using ExifTool after the image conversion has happened.\nSo in this example just naming the destination file image.heic is enough to get an HEIC file generated from the source file image.jpg.\nBut since I had to bulk convert some directories filled with images, I wrote this simple Bash script that searches a directory for JPG, PNG and TIFF images and then runs them through ImageMagick and saves an HEIC file with the same filename in the same directory.\nJust take this script and change /path/to/images to match your source directory and you are all set!\nfind -E '/path/to/images' -type f -iregex '.*\\.(JPG|JPEG|PNG|TIF|TIFF)$' |\\\n  while read full_image_path\n  do\n    path_sans_extension=\"${full_image_path%.*}\"\n    convert \"${full_image_path}\" \"${path_sans_extension}\".heic\n    exiftool -overwrite_original_in_place -tagsFromFile \"${full_image_path}\" \"${path_sans_extension}\".heic\n  done\n\n", "Q: 'Latin (Helvetica)' Format in Word 2016 (High Sierra) Word 2016 for Mac is styling text as 'Normal + (Latin) Helvetica' when I paste it into a new document.

I woke up this morning and it wouldn't start. At the time, the Magsafe2 Adapter was not lit up.\nMy wife has a similar laptop, so I was able to test my adapter on her Mac and her adapter on my Mac. There doesn't seem to be a problem with the adapter itself based on that.\nAfter moving where the adapter is plugged in, I am getting a green light from the Magsafe2 in my MBA, but it doesn't appear to be charging. I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*pressing various keys and moving mouse.\n\n*power button\n\n*doing an SMC reset (doesn't respond in any visible way to ShiftControlOptionPower)\n\n*Leaving it plugged in for a while, etc.\n\n\nAny suggestions?\nThere's no fan noise and no probable cause for damage.\n\nTo add a further detail, I can get either \n\n\n*\n\n*Green light if I switch cables with different mac in a short amount of time.\n\n*Green light if I remove and then reattach the cable in short amounts of time ( approximately 2 minutes or so)\n\n*No light if I leave it unplugged for a bit and mess around with trying to turn it on unplugged for a while\n\n\n(I don't know if any of this is relevant or should be considered relevant)\n\nA: The problem is unrelated to the status of your MagSafe light.  Green means \"charged\" and amber means \"charging.\"  Seeing a green light on your MagSafe means it's getting the signal that they battery is fully charged; there's no other diagnostic info related to this light.\nThe problem you are having is that your Mac won't turn on.  This could be due to:\n\n\n*\n\n*an issue with the power button on the top case assembly - the only way to diagnose this is for the battery to run down completely and then connect to power with auto power on enabled and/or open the case and begin repair level triage / fault isolation / part replacement or repair ( hereafter called open and repair)\n\n*an issue with the SMC - the only way to diagnose this is to try one time to reset the SMC - if after one reset, it doesn’t power on, open and repair.\n\n*an issue with the logic board - open and repair\n\n*an issue with a failed battery dragging the power too low to start - open and repair\nIf you have some technical skills, you can DIY diagnose the first two by bypassing the button and shorting the power pads on the logic board to simulate a button press or disconnect the battery for 30 seconds to reset the SMC.  This will triage and isolate the failure to the connectors running the keyboard and assure the logic board and storage and OS are all functional.\nHowever, the key to this that points in the direction of a logic board failure is this statement:\n\nThere's no fan noise...\n\nRegardless of any other issues, if the logic board is functioning properly, the fan will spin at 2000 RPM on MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.\nIf you're not technically inclined, or it's the third option (likely), it's time to take it in for service to someone that has the tools and training to perform the open and repair steps.\n\nA: You could try to reset the SMC by holding the left-side Shift-Control-Option keys with the power button at the same time with your charger plugged in.

I was seemingly not getting any power. When I press the power button and hold for 6 seconds or 10 seconds I would see the green lights on the side.\nHowever when I pressed Command + Shift + Option + the Power button, it booted right up. Only took a couple of seconds to start booting.\nI've been getting the service battery warning for a couple of years, so I know I will need to replace the battery if I plan to keep using this one.\n", "Q: How to replace the Comcast Calendar I have a Mac desktop computer and use Safari as my Browser on a Comcast account.  Comcast just sent a notice that they will shortly discontinue their Calendar application.   I have used this service for a long time and this is devastating to me as I depend on the calendar for notifications of important upcoming events. \nIs there something comparable to the Comcast calendar service that will send me email reminders of upcoming events?  \nI am not the most computer literate person and will greatly appreciate any assistance in how to get this done.  \n\nA: Pretty much any service should have email reminders.\nPersonally, I use Outlook.com and while I have no need for email reminders, I did confirm that the features is available.  See below\n\nYou can use this with your existing email, but you will need to sign up with a new account. Your Mail App (email client) will be able to work with the Outlook.com service as well\n\nA: Apple's Calendar included in macOS and iCloud can do this.\nIt defaults to alerting with a notification but you can add alerts that send email\n", "Q: Adding non-Apple Store eBook to iPhone I have a number of eBooks (ePub) either from free sources such as Gutenberg, or purchased elsewhere.\nI can open them easily enough on my iMac with eBooks, and I gather that they are in my library (when I try to add one manually, it tells me that it’s already there).\nOn my iPhone, however, I can’t see them at all.\nHow do I complete the processes?\nI will readily consider a third party app.\nI have the latest version of all software. In particular, iTunes 12.7, which is of no help to me at all.\n\nA: The only way to get those books on your iPhone is to open them on the phone. My recommendation is to upload all of those books to a cloud drive, then download them from the drive and then open them via iBooks.\n", "Q: How do I stop my iPhone camera automatically recording my location when I take photos? I already know I can go into my iPhone’s Privacy settings and select what apps can use my camera. My question is not about stopping apps from using my camera. It is about not allowing photos and videos taken by any app to also capture my location when taking them. How do I do this?\n\nA: Actually you’re already on the right track, as you also do this within your iPhone’s Privacy settings. More specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services\n\n*To the right of each app that is listed you’ll see an indication of when it accesses your location\n\n*Now tap on any of the apps you’d like to change the location settings of (Hint: you can also select the default Camera app to change its settings)\n\n*Exit Settings\n\n\nAny photos/videos you now take with an app that you've chosen to 'Never' allow access to your location, will not be able to record your location.\n", "Q: Combining parts from a MacBook Pro with a Dell Inspiron I have an old 2007 Macbook Pro 15\" and Dell Inspiron 1720. Since the logic board on the Mac is damaged, I kinda combined it in Dell (I took RAM, WiFi card, HDD). It all works perfectly. \nSince they are same age, and both use Intel. My question is, will Dell work with Mac processor inside as well? (Mac 2.4Ghz per core, and Dell is 2.0Ghz per core) \n\nA: Technically speaking, yes the CPU would work (provided it was still functional). Apple makes no changes to the (Intel) CPU making it \"Mac only.\"\nHowever, (and this is a big one), where Dell typically uses a socket, Apple solders the CPU to the board - you can remove the Dell CPU, but you need to de-solder it from the Mac.\n\n\nWhat you would spend on the labor just to remove the CPU is far more costly than surfing eBay for a deal on a compatible CPU.\n", "Q: IOS Update through tethering I am not having WiFi. To update to IOS 11 iphone needs a WiFi connection. \nMy idea is to use the Iphone for tethering and connect it \"to itself\". Will it work? Can I connect my Iphone the WiFi it makes itself and than do the update via mobile network?\n\nA: No. \nIt’s not possible to connect to an iPhone to its own Personal Hotspot network as a client. iPhone can only be connected to one Wi-Fi network, so any attempt to join a network will turn off Personal Hotspot.\nYou can tether to any other device, though and get your download on cellular data from the other plan. \n", "Q: What happens after you grant accessibility permissions to an app downloaded from the Mac App Store (Accessibility Permission = Control Over Your Mac) I recently installed an app from the mac app store known as commander  one from the mac app store which allows you to transfer files between the Cloud, Mobile devices and your mac, but as soon as I installed and opened it, it is constantly asking for accessibility permissions in - order to control my mac, so I deny it every-time it asks for it, so can anyone tell me why the app asks for this permission and what it would be able to do after granting this permission?\n\nA: Controlling your computer means that software can type for you and make changes to your settings, copy data off the clipboard (think passwords and social security numbers if you ever copy / type them) and generally get at things without you having to type or move the mouse. \nApple put that question there for you to say no always unless and until you really understand how that access is to be used and hopefully you have appropriate trust with the app developer in question. \nThe same NO should go with typing your password as an administrator when you install software or it asks to do things as root. The percentage of apps that truly need a kernel extension, admin permissions, control over your keyboard and mouse is far less than ask for it.\nOnce you give control of the both the UI and admin credentials, that Commander One software could then do whatever it pleases with your files and data and system until you remove or revoke the grants of elevated permission. \nI’m certainly not saying Commander One does any of that - just that is asks for all the capabilities and nothing would stop that program if it were programmed to do such things. \n", "Q: Burn marks on iMac Screen I'm wondering has anyone seen anything like this before? Was using my 2009 Unibody iMac this morning and noticed black, burn-like, marks appear on the screen gradually. \nThe machine wasn't under heavy usage or anything, however the screen felt extremely hot to touch.\nThe previous week there was condensation looking areas behind the glass.\nAny input appreciated, thanks.\n\n\nA: This happens all the time. \nCondensation and fog like effects are almost always benign and transient. Shut down form15 minutes minimum and restart. \nThe image persistence is somthing all LCD will eventually succumb to and some can show that even when brand new. Either power off entirely for hours or days or have an all white screen saver engage and prevent partial content from staying on screen static. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_persistence\n", "Q: Reformatted Hard Drive & Transferring Over User Data and Apps I tried to upgrade to High Siera but it crashed in the middle and totally messed up my Mac. I tried everything under the sun to fix it, be it Tech Tool, Drive Genius, Disk Warrior. Disj Utilities. Even Single user mode and certain fsck commands, but no matter what I did I could not get it to boot on it's own. Luckily I have a TechTool edrive so I can navigate. I also have a fresh Time Machine Backup. (Doing a Time Machine Restore did not help either).\nSo I decided to wipe the entire Hard Drive and now I am in the position where i have a blank drive and I wish get to get everything back on as it was. \nAll my Applications and their preferences, my mail and mailboxes, calendars, contacts, iTunes settings etc. Basically my desire is to have it mirror what it was.\nI have yet to install an OS, I have a Sierra install disk at the ready, but can someone advise me on the best way to migrate all my User items and Apps as I mentioned above...\nHow can I accomplish this?\n\nA: Caution: You don't really want to do a full restore, because the backup may contain whatever \"totally messed up [your] Mac.\"  Instead, if it were me, I would install the O.S. from the net or from media that you are sure is uncorrupted, then restore as many apps as possible from the App store or where ever else they came from.  Finally, restore the user account(s) one at a time and test things.  If you find problems in a user account, delete it, create a new account with the Prefs app, and then bring in data and documents a few at a time.\n\nA: As soon as you install the OS - connect your backup drive to see if the Migration Assistant can automatically restore the files from your backup.\nYou are prompted to restore from Time Machine - so connect the drive then.\nIf not - you can make a new account and then run Migration Assistant from /Applications/Utilities\n\n", "Q: White screen when installing OSX My daughter's MBP recently had a hard drive failure. I replaced the hard drive and purchased the Snow Leopard install disc from Apple.\nDuring the install start up, at a certain point the screen goes white and after a bit the fans go to a high speed.

This may have been a slightly rash move for I find that whenever I have attempted to install an AU based plugin intended for use with Logic Pro X, I am having difficulties in getting Logic Pro to recognise the new plug-in. \nI know that deleting /Users/carlca/Library/Caches/AudioUnitCache/com.apple.audiounits.cache will force Logic Pro X to run AuScan, and I have also discovered that rebooting the machine just prior to installing a new plug-in sometimes helps, but it's nowhere near 100% reliable and it's a pain in the derriere. \nDoes anyone know how I can fix this issue? Or has someone found a reliable way to install AU based plugins for Logic Pro X under macOS High Sierra?\nI'm hoping I don't need to wait for macOS High Sierra and/or Logic Pro X to be updated.\n\nA: Actually, I have made progress with my setup. The trick seems to be to be disciplined enough to carry out the installations, then deleting /Users/[USER]/Library/Caches/AudioUnitCache/com.apple.audiounits.cache, then rebooting, before finally opening Logic Pro X again, at which point it should rescan all the new plugins. It's a fiddly procedure but it seems to work!\n\nA: Good news, I think! I've just installed the newly released 10.13.1 High Sierra update. I then high-tailed it over to KVRAudio and downloaded an AU plugin (Sprike, since you ask - it's pretty good!). I was able to install it and then run Logic Pro X without any deleting of files or rebooting malarky. It just worked.\n", "Q: Is it possible to bypass the activation on an iPhone 5c that has \"No SIM\" issue? I have an iPhone 5c with a No SIM issue.  I DFU restored it to no avail, still shows \"No SIM\".  I wonder if there's a way to bypass the activation so I can use it even if just on WI-FI.  Could jail-breaking it help anything?  Any other means?\n\nA: Try restoring it via an iTunes backup.\n", "Q: Is there a way to exactly position a window? I have a Quicktime window, and I would like to have it positioned at exactly (533,118). I have (painfully) achieved this using the Macbook's screenshot functionality (because it shows the coordinates of the cursor, so with a couple tries it can be done).\nI know that windows normally remember their last position, but sometimes I need to move them to another location. It would be great if I could just input the desired coordinates.\nI'm using macOS 10.13.\n\nA: The two window manager tools I'd use for this are Moom and Divvy - both offer demo versions so you can try before you buy.\nOnce you have an automated move/tile/manage tool, you'll start doing this sort of automated management more and more.\n\n*\n\n*https://manytricks.com/moom/\n\n*http://mizage.com/divvy/\nI suppose if you wanted to learn AppleScript - that has all the hooks you need to resize the windows, no software to try or load.

You might even see some videos in YouTube in which some people have managed to dual boot and have verbose boot in iOS 10! But the sad part is never reveal it they might have developed the code but some might even get it from unknown sources.

So please turn on \"set time/date automatically\" Settings > General > Date & Time > Set Automatically\n\n*Are you using multiple accounts for iTunes, App Store, iCloud? Multiple accounts are can cause many problems\n\n*If you're tried Reset Network Settings, then try again by different Wi-Fi connection.\n\n*If you've enabled \"iCloud Backup\" on your iPhone, then turn it off and try again.\n\n\nA: Just in case someone overlooked this.\nThere needs to be an internet connection in order to either turn 'Find My iPhone' off, or sign out of iCloud.\nIt is not uncommon to restore the device (it will not remember wifi passwords) and then erase it. In such case, you will need to connect to the internet first.\n", "Q: iMac 27\" 14,2 late 2013 CPU upgrade I recently brought an iMac 27\" 14,2 back to life after a CPU fault (which  in itself was odd since I never seen a PC or Mac with a fried Intel CPU) and it runs pretty nice ... but on a Intel Core i3 4130 which leaves a lot to desire in terms of performance.\ni'm thinking of replacing it with an i5 or i7 - but then I've seen that Xeon 2013 Xeon's are quite cheap and was wondering if the iMac Mainboard can run with it.\nDoes anybody knows if such upgrade is possible? \nE3 1150 Xeon's are basically i7s without the GPU but more cache and offer better per watt performance.\n\nUpdate\nI will test 3 different CPU's with the iMac 27 14,2 mainboard, despite the the answer below.

The last thing that I've played is Unturned which didn't really require a high spec but my MBA heats pretty much every time which scared me. \nI've been searching for threads with the same question and most says it will run fine. But will it really not overheat and completely damage it?\n\nA: I don't know what CSGO is but the answer to the question of whether or not an application will overheat your CPU is an emphatic \"no.\"\nSee this answer for additional reference.\nWhether you run something in Terminal to max out your CPU (as in the linked answer) or a GUI app, both your MacBook Air (all computers for that matter - PCs and Macs alike) as well as the CPU itself has thermal protection mechanisms built in.  The fans will spin up, kernel_task will consume massive amounts of processor resources, the CPU will scale back and even shut itself down if necessary.\nAs for your game....\nYou didn't specify which CPU your MBA had nor how much memory.

The 25\" monitor broke and I replaced it with a newer, bigger LG 29UM68-P UltraWide monitor, also with DisplayPort.\nWhen I connect my MBP, the monitor detects the connection, but reports \"No Signal\" when I switch the input to DisplayPort. The SAME monitor+cable works fine with a newer MacBook Air. \nI have updated macOS to the latest version of Sierra (10.12.6). When I open the Display applet, it detects the LG Monitor, but reports it as a 34\" model. I can hit \"Gather Windows\" and change the resolution on the LG, but I always get a gray screen with \"No Signal\"\nupdate:\nI have tried to reset the SMC once, also the NVRAM (as per below) and even checked the monitor while booting into safe mode. None of these steps changee the outcome. What else can I try?  \n\nA: Here's what worked for me (none of the above worked): unplug the DP cable. Then slowly plug it in until the laptop screen (not the external) flickers and returns back to the normal image, then immediately push (not too hard) the cable in the rest of the way. Seems that some MacBooks have finicky ports.\n\nA: I note you've already reset the SMC, but there are a few other things you can try as well.\nReset the NVRAM\nTo reset the Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM) on your model of MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP (i.e. a full shut down, not just logging out).\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your MBP reboots again (i.e. a 2nd time) and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your MBP reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nIf you find this makes no difference, you can also test to see what happens when booted into Safe Mode.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your MBP into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. try connecting your display to determine if the issue is still present, etc)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac normally and try connecting your display again\n\n\nIf your display connects during Safe Mode but doesn't connect afterwards when booted normally, let me know. Otherwise, if you had no joy regardless of whether you were in Safe Mode or not, it's probably time to test your hardware.\nRun Apple Hardware Test\nYour model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP \n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\n", "Q: Prioritize exact matched words in Mac dictionary app? When typing a word in the dictionary app, it shows a list of matched words on the left pane. However, the exact matches are far down the list, the top words are usually not relevant, like terms from wikipedia. Going down the list and choosing the matched word manually is a nuisance.\nChanging order of dictionaries in preferences does not help, as it only changes the result content on the right pane.\nIs there a way to prioritize exact match in dictionary app?\n\nA: Seems this is a compatibility error between the dictionary app and other dictionaries like wikipedia. \nI only found a partial workaround, that is do not use wikipedia in dictionary app, as most troublesome words are from there.

And can it be turned off to only include the main screen area?\n(I think the small region is called a \"notch\"):\n\n\nA: The screenshot will include whatever is supposed to be there.\nFor example if you're on your home screen it will show the part of your wallpaper you cannot physically see when looking at the device.\nIf you're watching a video horizontally on YouTube for example, it will show whatever is supposed to be displayed in the notch too.\nWhile watching videos horizontally you actually lose out on what is supposed to be displayed in the notch, rather than scaling the video size down to accommodate what would be a smaller res video.\nIf something vital was displayed in the non-visible notch part of the video, you could take a screenshot of the frame, view the part you needed, then delete the screenshot without saving it for example.\nYou can see an example of a screenshot on an iPhone X here.\n", "Q: In Macbook, what are Thunderbolt MAC addresses for, if ethernet adapters provide ones? I think this answer and this one say that each ethernet adapter, such as USB-C-Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, has its own MAC address. So, that means Macbook (Pro) doesn't have a built-in ethernet card.\nBut I'm curious, what are the Thunderbolt MAC addresses then? In my MBP 13\" (2015), networksetup -listallhardwareports command shows ethernet (MAC) addresses of Thunderbolt 1 and Thunderbolt 2. Also, the result of ifconfig -a contains bridge0 which has a MAC address.\nWhat are they for, if every ethernet adapter decides the MAC address? Can I just ignore them?\nThank you.\n\nA: You can connect two Thunderbolt-enabled Macs together using a Thunderbolt-to-Thunderbolt bridge connections, therefore you'd need each end to be able to identify itself.\nMore information here: https://9to5mac.com/2016/11/22/macbook-pro-thunderbolt-3-bridge-network-video/\n", "Q: TouchBar appears on the screen when clicked When I try to adjust the volume, the TouchBar appears on my screen.

In Terminal:\natsutil autoactivation -e\nCredit: https://discussions.apple.com/message/32553150#message32553150\n\nA: Without knowing your browser version / MacOS version combo, the culprits are probably font corruption or more likely the character encoding isn't UTF-8. \nI'm unable to reproduce your screenshot with Safari 11 and 10.12.6, but I can get that specific emoji to falter by switching to other character encodings. \nYou can check this in Safari in \"View\" > \"Text Encoding\".\nIf you are the developer behind the website in question, you should add the correct character encoding to the page itself to ensure the emoji renders correctly for others. There are good examples of how to do this at W3schools, but this might work too:\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n\nThe charset tag in the page is lowercase ;) \nYou might also try removing the HTML4 charset tag that is also present:\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\">\n\nOnly one is required and the browser should ignore the one that is not right, but that doesn't always happen. \n", "Q: How to trigger spinning wheel diagnostics report I'm working on application that consume significant CPU time and memory under heavy load. \nmy setup configuration is fusion VM that runs macOS Sierra 10.12.6. \nAt some stage I get spinning wheel and the entire VM hangs.

Is there any problem with cron or I this kind of behaviour expected?\n\nA: You don't need to call cron directly. Any commands you want to run need to be added to the crontab of the user they should run as. You can edit your crontab by running\ncrontab -e\n\nor, if you are an admin user and want to edit the crontab of another user,\ncrontab -u USERNAME -e\n\nPS: Run man 5 crontab for details about the format of the file, what kind of special commands you can use, and some samples. 5 * * * * /path/to/script seems to be ok though.\n\nA: On macOS High Sierra (and perhaps earlier), cron is disabled in some configurations. There is, however, still a LaunchDaemon for it.\nCheck to see if cron is enabled:\nsudo launchctl list | grep cron\n\nYou should see com.vix.cron.plist if cron is running.

My Mac laptop is freezing like age old windows laptop since I have upgrade my mac os to mac os high sierra. \nMac details : Mac book pro retina mid 2012 \nIt just freezes and i am forced to restart my laptop, (it never ever happened before) \nIs any one facing this problem, how to fix it ?\nSteps done :\n\n\n*\n\n*Run complete diagnostic test \n\n*Reset smc \n\n*Reset nvram from this\nlink\n\nA: The first rule of troubleshooting, \"isolate and identify.\" In other words, if you have added any hardware to your Mac over the years, remove it. I have seen RAM now recognized as \"bad\" by a new OS where it worked fine with the previous OS.\nThe comments about Safe Mode also apply as that disables third party additions to your computer. Hold down SHIFT while booting, when the Apple logo appears release shift. Booting takes longer in Safe Mode, let it do it's thing. If your Mac stops freezing then something you installed is broken under the new OS.\nThe 3rd thing I would try is one of the OS \"cleaning\" tools. I use Onyx (there are others, that's my favorite). Download it, and run the automation tool, then reboot your Mac.\nLet us know the results by editing your question to indicate what you have tried.\n\nA: I was having the same issue on High Sierra 10.13.3 after I migrated my system to an external SSD with APFS formatted as a BOOT DRIVE. Since the migration, I get lots of freeze and restart issues after an hour of usage or not waking up from sleep. After running ONYX (the latest), its been running like a charm, no issues so far after 14 hours of usage and switching between multiple applications.\n\n\n*\n\n*First try Running Onyx (Free download) maintenance Script if that doesn’t solve the\nproblem, then:\n\n*Second, go into recovery mode (Restart, then press Command R until you see the apple logo) and reinstall High Sierra, this\nmay correct some issues with the OS.\n\n\nA: I was faced with the same dilemma, it seemed like my MacBook Pro (mid-2015) was 'freezing.' I stumbled across a the fix to it after seeing your post - you can read about it here: https://jrgarrigues.github.io/2017/11/05/high-sierra-freezing/ \nThe gist of the linked article is this:\n\nReset your NVRAM and the SMC [System Management Controller]\nFirst reset your NVRAM.\n  Turn off your Mac. Then turn it on and hold Command+Option+P+R while the computer is booting up. You will\n  hear two chimes or on newer MacBook Pro models you will see the screen\n  come on and go off twice.\nNow, shut your computer down again and reset the SMC [System\n  Management Controller].With your Mac off, press Shift+Control+Option and then hold these keys while pressing and holding the power\n  button for 10 seconds.\n\n\nA: Not sure what your model you have but I hope this helps someone. So for me I had an intermittent freezing even after performing restores several times and replacing the hard drive. I was getting an intermittent prohibitory sign basically a circle with a line through it. The resolution was replacing the hard drive cable. I couldn't believe it but the whole time it was the hard drive cable. I would suggest ruling out software issues by just performing a simple reinstallation of the OS. If that doesn't work more than likely your issue is hardware related. I replaced the hard drive still same issue replaced the cable all good now \n\nA: Add the below to your /etc/nsmb.conf file.

If they belong to the previous client how should I remove it ? is it safe to just delete them all ?\n\nA: Basically, Apple Mail and all other mail programs download caches from your email account. these cache files often work as a backup. removal of accounts doesn't remove them. And that is a good news for you. If someday you lose your emails from the server, you are assured a copy of the emails sits on your system and you can recover all your emails from there.\nthanks,\nJason\n", "Q: Could not activate iPhone because \"activation server cannot be reached\" I just purchased an iPhone 5s and attached to my iCloud.

How in the heck do I get it to come up??\nFor example, I try to log on to iTunes on my iMac normally, and then it asks for the 6 digit verification code from another device. Okay, no problem. I retrieve it, and when I come back to the Mac, there's no input screen to key in the verification codes. It leaves me hanging. \n\nA: Got exactly the same problem today, e.g:\n\n*\n\n*have two-factor auth.\n\n*tried login to icloud on some old macbook (OSX Lion - 10.7)\n\n*on my iphone i got the code\n\n*but on the macbook there are no input fields - e.g. impossible to enter the code - there is no place where.\n\nMore googling and I found this page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915 where says:\n\nWhat if I use two-factor authentication on a device running older\nsoftware?\nIf you use two-factor authentication with devices running\nolder OS versions—like an Apple TV (2nd or 3rd generation)—you might\nbe asked to add your six-digit verification code to the end of your\npassword when signing in. Get your verification code from a trusted\ndevice running iOS 9 and later or OS X El Capitan and later, or have\nit sent to your trusted phone number. Then type your password followed\nby the six-digit verification code directly into the password field.\n\nSo, in short: if you didn't get the input fields, do the following:\n\n*\n\n*on the trusted device \"Get the verification code\" how - see this\n\n*and on the device without input fields enter your password, immediatelly followed by the 6 digit code - e.g. \"MyPassord123456\"\n\nThat's all - it works. :)\n\nA: Your Apple ID's account security type is requesting verification (Two Factor Authentication). While this issues is primarily a software issue, If you want to cancel the security codes all together then you can switch the security type from Two Factor Authentication to Secondary Authentication where you'll need to know the security questions and your password to access your account. You can change that at: http://www.appleid.apple.com\n", "Q: How to reinstall old iOS software? I have an older iPod touch which which supports up to iOS 6.1.6 and nothing newer.  This device is equipped with a Linea Pro barcode scanner and previously had an application called \"Web Barcode\" installed.  Recently I was attempting to do some work on a web application I wrote and realized that I needed to update to a newer version of Web Barcode - but unfortunately the Apple ID saved on my device was deactivated a few years ago.  So I went to settings and updated it with my current Apple ID.  Then again tried to update the App from the Apple store.  Still no dice - it was asking me for the password on the old account.\nSo then I figured I'd just remove it and reinstall from scratch.  Deleted the app and went to the store but now I am met with a message that the new version requires at least iOS 8.0.\nI feel I followed a very logical series of steps to update this application and while I can understand that I won't be able to install the newest version, how can I get the old version back?  The device is completely useless without the barcode scanning application and the Apple store is now refusing to install any version at all on my device.\nWhat can I do to get the original version of this application reinstalled?\n\nA: To download the last compatible version of an app, the app must be in your purchase history for that Apple ID already. Use iTunes 12.6.3 to download the app, signing in with your new Apple ID. Once the app is in your purchase history, attempting to download it again on your device should prompt you to accept an older version of the app.\n", "Q: How to change bluetooth device type on Mac (e.g. force recognition of bluetooth device as a keyboard) In Bluetooth Preferences on my Mac, my wireless keyboard simply shows up as a bluetooth device and is not recognised as a keyboard.\nIs there a way to force the Mac to recognise this device as a keyboard?\nThe reason I need to do this is so that the keyboard shows up as an option in the \"Select Keyboard\" drop down in System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier keys.\nPlease see attached screenshot of device only being recognised as standard bluetooth device.\n\n\nA: Go into System Preferences > Keyboard and then click on the Set Up Bluetooth keyboard button and see if you are able to properly configure your bluetooth keyboard that way. \n", "Q: What is the vibration when I picked up an iPhone 7 Plus that feels like a gyroscope? Recently when I pick up my iPhone 7 Plus (especially when it is charging), there was some kind of vibration that felt like a turning gyroscope which I played when I was a kid. And then after picking up the phone for 10, 20 seconds, the vibration would stop. What was it about? If it was a gyroscope, what was it turning for?\n\nA: i think it's Taptic Engine. This engine can turned off.\nIf you like to disable go to Settings -> Sounds & Haptics - > System Haptics -> turn off.\nTaptic Engine is different from 3D Touch. So disabling haptics won’t turn off 3D touch.\n", "Q: Why Will Xcode 9.2 beta not Download? Xcode 9.2 beta (9C30) was released today, but I have been unable to download it from developer.apple.com.

Is there any way I can get my login to accept two different passwords?\n\nA: Short answer: No. There is no way to specify this in macOS. I've never seen this ability in any operating system I've used in 35+ years in the profession.\nYou can set a firmware password on your Mac, adding an extra level of security before a user login, but it is not recommended.\n", "Q: Apple website animations do not work on Safari 11 I have a Late 2011 15\" MBP with El Capitan(highest update).

I'm using a program named Macs Fan Control(gives me to control mac's fan) on my MacBook Pro. \nSo there are two fans at MacBook Pro. Fan on the left side's highest RPM is 6156, and right side's highest RPM is 5700. Why these fans' speed is different each other?\n\nA: Your fan speeds, among other things, are managed by the System Management Controller (SMC). Your MacBook Pro has a number of sensors distributed throughout to measure things such as temperature. \nThe SMC uses a range of info (such as temperature readings from sensors) to ensure that your fans operate at the optimal speed to protect your Mac from damage. The fact that one fan is spinning at a higher RPM than another is not a concern. The different fans can operate independently and are each aimed at cooling different aspects of your hardware.\n", "Q: iTunes unable to change Artwork for Albums With iTunes 12.7.0 and OS 10.13 I cannot change the Album Artwork.

By the time I can access the camera, my photo opportunity moment has passed. \nPerhaps some combination of hardware buttons can be set to bring up the camera?\n\nA: Assuming you're using some version of iOS 11?\nIf you have raise to wake enabled you can simply raise your iPhone then swipe right on the lock screen.\nIf you don't have raise to wake enabled or any for any other reason this might be faster - press the power button and immediately swipe right on the lock screen.\nThe newer iPhones in particular load the camera very quickly so by the time you finish the right swipe the camera is auto-focused and ready to go.\nAnother tip would be to make sure you have the camera icon docked on your home screen. This would allow you to access it quickly if you're in an app. You could try using control centre too, but you would have to swipe up from the bottom twice in most apps.\nCurrently there are no hardware shortcuts like this on iOS.\n", "Q: How to upgrade from OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 to macOS Sierra 10.12.6 I have OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6 installed and want to upgrade to macOS Sierra 10.12.6\nI have downloaded macOS Sierra version 10.13\nI have .dmg file of macOS Sierra 10.12.6 but when I am going install it gives me the following error:\n\nI found a lot of .dmg of version 10.12 but I didn't get anywhere then I got version 10.12.1.\nNow I am confused that do I compulsory need to fine 10.12 and install it and than after update 10.12.4 and than after 10.12.6?\n\nA: You have downloaded some updater files for macOS Sierra which require at least an already installed macOS Sierra 10.12.\nThey are useless if OS X 10.11 El Capitan is installed.\nGo to the App Store, download the macOS Sierra installer and install it.

I have an app which is written in AppleScripting language which checks if the S.M.A.R.T. status is 'Verified' if it is not then it will automatically show me a dialog alert. But I need it to run every 30 minutes. I used cron before but it never works with .app extension. So how can I accomplish running the app at regular intervals using launchd?\n\nA: Use oascript to call your ApplesScript.\n$ oascript foobar.applescript\n\nIn your plist your ProgramArguments definition to launch the app would be as follows:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>osascript</string>\n        <string>foobar.applescript</string>\n    </array>\n\n\nTo get your item to run, you need a StartInterval definition which takes an integer for the number of seconds (1800 for 30 mins) between runs.  \n<key>StartInterval</key>\n<integer>1800</integer>\n\n\nA simple but functional plist would look as follows:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.user.foobar.app</string>\n   <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>osascript</string>\n        <string>foobar.applescript</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>1800</integer>\n\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: Apple documents everything you need to write a hand crafted XML file to save to the filesystem and than load using launchtl load /path/to/xml but the documentation is very dense, assumes you have several days or weeks of experience and time to learn.\nI recommend starting with a tool like LaunchControl or Lingon to ease your learning curve and add a nice interface to pick times like 30 minutes for the repeat interval instead of needing to code 1800 seconds into the xml file.\nHere is what you'd enter for your 30 minutes and run only when the user is logged in constraints in the LaunchControl app\n\nAgain, you can do this by hand, working through every hurdle you will face (debugging errors to standard out and standard error when things don't work, debugging permissions and folder / file locations) but that's typically too broad a question here for getting someone from an idea to working implementation.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html\nI'd go for the easy tools unless you have a desire to master several scripting tools and the launch daemon and control system under the hood.\n", "Q: Is git pre-installed on macOS Sierra? I am very new to macOS, knowing Ubuntu a little bit, and am wondering whether git is pre-installed on macOS or not.

I installed Homebrew before checking for git, so maybe this causes some interdependencies?\n\nA: macOS does come with a binary at /usr/bin/git, however by default it's a wrapper around the command line tools installer. Running the command will print the following and return immediately.\nnote: install requested for command line developer tools\n\nA prompt will ask the user to install the command line tools, with a button that downloads and installs the toolset.\n\nOnce installed, /usr/bin/git will be a proper version of Git compiled by Apple (noted by the ‘Apple Git’).\n$ /usr/bin/git --version\ngit version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)\n\nIf Git is installed using Homebrew, it will be at /usr/local/bin/git by default on Intel, at /opt/homebrew/bin/git on ARM.\n", "Q: how to run `hping` without `sudo` I've installed hping using brew install hping.\nWhen I run hping without sudo I get:\n$ hping 8.8.8.8\n[open_sockraw] socket(): Operation not permitted\n[main] can't open raw socket\n\nWhen I run sudo hping, naturally, I get:\n$ sudo hping -S -p 80 8.8.8.8\nPassword:\nHPING 8.8.8.8 (en0 8.8.8.8): S set, 40 headers + 0 data bytes\nlen=46 ip=8.8.8.8 ttl=57 id=332 sport=80 flags=RA seq=0 win=512 rtt=1.4 ms\nlen=46 ip=8.8.8.8 ttl=57 id=46923 sport=80 flags=RA seq=1 win=512 rtt=2.7 ms\nlen=46 ip=8.8.8.8 ttl=57 id=25098 sport=80 flags=RA seq=2 win=512 rtt=2.2 ms\n^C\n--- 8.8.8.8 hping statistic ---\n8 packets tramitted, 8 packets received, 0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max = 1.4/2.4/2.9 ms\n\nMy question here is, what permissions need to be changed to give hping the permissions it needs - and how do I do that?\n\nA: It is always a security risk to run a binary as root. The better way of doing things would be to set the unix raw socket capability.\nsudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/bin/hping3\nThat way the you dont give the binary permissions that it doesnt need.\n(You can also look at set capabilites, e.g.: getcap /bin/ping)\n\nA: To change the behavior of hping you have to change user:group of the executable and add the setuid flag:\nsudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/Cellar/hping/3.20051105/sbin/hping3\nsudo chmod u+s /usr/local/Cellar/hping/3.20051105/sbin/hping3\n\n(just to remember: /usr/local/sbin/hping|hping2|hping3 are finally soft-linked to /usr/local/Cellar/hping/<​version_nr>/sbin/hping3)\nSome hping options are disabled if the s flag is set!\n\nFor security reasons a different approach is preferred therefore: Making a program always run as root in OS X!\n", "Q: Why is my launchctl program not accepting external connections?

Any ideas how to solve?\nThanks. \n\nA: My first thought would be that it's a connection issue. Have you noticed any other symptoms that could also be explained by that possibility? \nAlso, you could go through the process of unpairing and then restoring your Apple Watch to see if that resolves the issue. See: How to unpair and restore the Apple Watch.\nAnother option is to call Apple Support. They can actually run diagnostics on your Apple Watch remotely (you will need to have your iPhone with you as well in order for them to do this). It doesn't take long to do and will help identify if there are any hardware issues.\n", "Q: Is there anything more secure than a password protected SparseImage against state actors? If you had to secure important document in an encrypted, yet easily accessible format from state actors; would there be anything better than an password protected sparseimage? I used to use cryptkeeper in linux. A password protected sparseimage is the closest thing I have found on the mac side. Since this occurred (https://www.macrumors.com/2017/10/05/macos-high-sierra-disk-utility-vulnerability/) I am doubting that choice.\n\nA: Encrypted disk images are secure. The issue that you referenced is a user interface bug in Disk Utility, not a problem with the encryption. You can also create disk images without using Disk Utility, e.g. using hdiutil on the command-line or a utility such as DropDMG.\n", "Q: How do I programmatically change the \"Hide extension\" setting for a list of files? For some reason, when I do a bash operation on a list of files (i.e. ls | cat -n | while read n f; do mv \"$f\" `printf \"name-%02d.png\" $n`; done, the \"Hide extension\" setting becomes enabled on all of them, and I have to manually uncheck that via \"Get info\". How can I avoid this, or fix it programmatically?\nEDIT: The files I was operating on were native screenshots and thus already had their extensions hidden. My bad!\n\nA: Hmmm, that sounds really odd. I just ran your sample code on some test files and it didn't alter the Hide extension flag at all. Are you sure the files didn't already have that option checked before you ran your command? Have you tried creating a few fresh files, verifying manually that none have that option selected, and then running your command on them?\nI can't help in terms of the \"how to avoid this\" part of your question, as I can't manage to recreate your problem on my end. But you can disable that setting programmatically. If you have Xcode installed, you can do the following:\n# Disables \"Hide extension\" for all visible files in current directory\nfor file in *; do\n    SetFile -a e \"$file\"\ndone\n\nNote that if you ever want to reverse the process (i.e. turn on the setting), you can do so by changing the lowercase e to an uppercase E.\n# Enables \"Hide extension\" for all visible files in current directory\nfor file in *; do\n    SetFile -a E \"$file\"\ndone\n\nIf you don't have Xcode installed, see this answer on superuser for instructions on how to do the same thing using AppleScript.\nBy the way, you should try to avoid parsing the output of ls like you have done in your example. It can cause problems if any of the files you are processing contain a newline character in their filename. This is particularly important if you ever write a script that will be processing files which you have not created yourself (as you won't know how they are named). See Why you shouldn't parse the output of ls(1) for details.\n", "Q: USB-C power delivery safe? so I bought a USB-C hub for my MacBook Pro 2017,\nspecifically, this one:\nhttps://www.aukey.com/products/usb-c-to-4-port-usb-3-0-hub-with-hdmi-port-usb-c-charing-port-cb-c58\nit has a power delivery USB-C port, and I'm wondering if it safe for my Macbook to always use that port when I have the hub plugged in (so I can use the other USB-C port on the mac for other purposes) or it is better to plug power directly into the Macbook? any technical differences?\n\nA: This should be perfectly fine, as it's exactly what it's designed to do. The port in question is a USB-C Power Delivery port and the 2017 MBP supports USB-C PD.\nNote this hub is not the charger - it is merely providing the means for your 2017 MBP charger to be used to charge your MBP via the hub. As you're still using the Apple charger that came with your MBP, the actual power being delivered directly to your Mac should be the same, so in that sense there should be no technical differences.\n"]
