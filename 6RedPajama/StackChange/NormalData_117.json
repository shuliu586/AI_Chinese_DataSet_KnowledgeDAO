Let me give you a direct answer though:\nSetting apt-get connection timeouts\nYou can control these timeouts via the following apt.conf options:\n\n  Acquire::http::Timeout \"10\";\n  Acquire::ftp::Timeout \"10\";\n  \nNote that this only applies to connection timeouts, NOT \"finish time\" timeouts, i.e. if it connects within 10 seconds, it will continue to download a 100MB package even if it's at 1 KB/second :)\nTo implement these options, simply create a conf file in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d; suppose we call it 99timeout.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt+F2, type gksudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99timeout\n\n*Type/paste the above lines, with your choice of timeout in seconds\n\n*Save and exit.\n\n*Now try sudo apt-get update\n\nAnd the terminal-addict's \"find best server\" hack!\nExpanded and moved as an answer to this more appropriate question\n\nAdditional apt-get conf options that you can try to tweak\n\n\n*\n\n*Acquire::Queue-Mode: Queuing mode; Queue-Mode can be one of host or access which determines how APT parallelizes outgoing connections.  host means that one connection per target host will be opened, access means that one connection per URI type will be opened.\n\n*Acquire::Retries: Number of retries to perform. If this is non-zero APT will retry failed files the given number of times.\n\n*Acquire::http::Dl-Limit: accepts integer values in kilobytes, to throttle download speed and not slow down your browsing/email/etc. when updating.

The only way to get things back is to force turn off the laptop and restart. Unplugging/replugging monitor doesn't work, and seems like ubuntu crashes.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: (From user comments)\nDeleting ~/.config/monitors.xml restored the default screen configuration and screens started working again. For some reasons, some setting in that file goes awry it seems.\n\nA: I have made, assembled and repaired computers, cables, and PC boards.\nThere are a few things I have seen that may be causing your problems.\nOne is when the wire is put into the pin on the connector on the cable (If its a crimp style cable.) some times the wire will be pushed too far into the pin when the pin is crimped and then the pin won't seat right in the connector.  \nAnother problem is solder or even a scrap piece of metal, etc. from the manufacturing process can get into the female socket part of the connector and push the pin out of the opposite male connector (I've seen this on cable and PC board connectors.).  This can cause the connection to be intermittent.\nIf either the cable or the computer uses an insulation displacement connector(Ribbon cable, etc.).  These some times have crimp problems, wire damage or even metal, etc. from the manufacturing process in the crimp. These can also be intermittent.\nYou could even have a bad solder joint or trace on the laptops circuit board.  And again we have an intermittent connection.\nAlso with these small fragile connectors a pin can easily be bent or broken off.  And again we can have connection problems.\nNow your probably wondering how a hardware problem can affect a config file?   It is because some of the pins in that mini VGA connector are used to identify the monitor type and resolutions to the system.  Then that config file is written from the type ID'ed   You could turn off auto monitor type detection for that laptops video(Not all video(Drivers) have this option and it may stop the laptop from seeing the monitor when you plug it in.).   \nI would try a new cable first.  You can probably do this for free just take that laptop, monitor, and cable to the computer store you got it at, or a local computer store that sells laptops of that type and cables for them.\nYou may be able to see something in the sockets of the female end of that mini VGA(Bright light, magnifying glass and good eyesight are needed here.), or see if one of the pins or sockets are not seated, or if they are sticking out all the way on the male end, or are even bent or broken off. \nAnyway I hope this helps, I know what a royal pain these little nagging problems ca be from both ends, as a computer user and as a tech support.\nRemember, try the obvious things first!\n", "Q: Installtion failed a .deb Package I try to install a .deb package with terminal use \n\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nbut show this error\n\ndpkg: error processing Pydict.deb (--install):  parsing file\n  '/var/lib/dpkg/tmp.ci/control' near line 8 package 'pydict': \n  duplicate value for `Architecture' field Errors were encountered while\n  processing:  Pydict.deb\n\n\nA: You cannot install random .deb files on any Ubuntu installation.

HFS+ fsck and mkfs have been ported to Linux and are part of the hfsprogs package.\nIn 2009, these drivers were diagnosed to be corrupting HFS+ drives with a capacity greater than 2 TB. Consequently, Linux distributions such as Debian and Ubuntu also stopped allowing mounting of HFS+ drives or partitions greater than 2 TB. As of February 2011, work is in progress to lift this restriction.\nUnder Linux's current HFS+ driver, journaling must be disabled in order to write data safely to an HFS+ partition; journaling can be disabled under Mac OS X, provided the partition isn't being used by Apple's Time Machine software. An HFS+ partition with journaling enabled may be forcibly mounted with write-access under Linux, but this is unsupported and unsafe.\nAround April 2011, Netgear released the source code of one of its NAS appliances, providing an implementation of write-support for journaling-enabled HFS+ partitions; unfortunately, the code is compatible only with an earlier version Linux. A port to newer versions of Linux has been released for review and further development, though it is apparently untested and untrustworthy.\n\n Source: wikipedia\n", "Q: How do I get my (UBUNTU certified) Dell N5050's webcam to work with google video chat and Skype using version 12.04?

First, you need to make sure the host supports loopback and LVM, and has the appropriate modules loaded.  Then, some manual steps need to be completed:\nFirst, Grant container access to the various device nodes losetup and LVM need, specifically /dev/loop[0-9], /dev/loop-control, and /dev/mapper/control.\nIn /usr/share/pyshared/juju/lib/lxc/data/lxc.conf, add the following:\nlxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 10:236 rwm\nlxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 10:237 rwm\nlxc.cgroup.devices.allow = b 7:* rwm\n\nThen you'll also need to manually create the loop-control device node somehow within the container.  If you've already deployed a unit, and Juju has a template for the environment, you can do this within the /dev directory of that template, eg:\nsudo mknod /var/lib/lxc/adam-sample-0-template/rootfs/dev/loop-control c 10 237\n\nThe /dev/mapper/controller device node will be created when LVM gets installed.\nAlternatively, you can modify the nova-volume charm to do this for you automatically during its install hook.  Unfortunately, I do not know a way for Juju or LXC to pre-authorize and populate the /dev directory of new containers with devices required by the charm.  Until those kinds of features land, the nova-volume charm (and probably nova-compute, too) will likely require awkward work arounds like this to ensure they work correctly in LXC containers.\n", "Q: How to enable wireless network for standard users? how can I allow standard users to connect to wireless network without administrator password?\nIt's simple question.

I am having DNS problems since upgrading to Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) from Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) yesterday.\nDNS sometimes works, but it is very slow.\nI have read the blog post DNS in Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*\"I really don’t want a local resolver, how can I turn it off?\n  To turn off dnsmasq in Network Manager, you need to edit\n  /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and comment the “dns=dnsmasq”\n  line (put a # in front of it) then do a “sudo restart network-manager”.\"\n  \n\nI do not have this line to comment. Checking in Synaptic Package Manager reveals that dnsmasq isn't installed (dnsmasq-base is).\nEditing and creating connections using the NetworkManager GUI (and specifying DNS servers) doesn't help; Ubuntu is not respecting user GUI set DNS servers. Should these GUI tools not work?\n\n  \n*\n  \n*\"I use a static IP address configuration, where should I put my DNS configuration?\n  The DNS configuration for a static interface should go as\n  “dns-nameservers”, “dns->search” and “dns-domain” entries added to the\n  interface in /etc/network/interfaces\"\n  \n\nAre any examples of this available? My /etc/network/interfaces is extremely sparse.\nFor now, I have edited /etc/resolv.conf replacing nameserver 127.0.0.1 with that of my DNS server (my broadband router), but I don't know how long this fix will last before the file is overwritten by this new system (dnsmasq?).\n\nA: network-manager is meant to manage your whole workstation's networking requirements in 12.04 along with resolvconf and dnsmasq-base. \ndnsmasq-base is just the executable dnsmasq file which network-manager runs using a separate config and no start-up scripts. \nresolvconf rewrites /etc/resolv.conf whenever one of the 12.04 integrated packages tells it via scripts that something has changed.\nIt doesn't sound like it's correctly installed if you don't have that dns=dnsmasq line in your config. It might also account for the slowness.\nYou could try dpkg-reconfigure on network-manager and on resolvconf \nAlternatively if you are using programs like VPNs that are not integrated with network-manager or other non-compatible programs, you could de-install network-manager and resolvconf completely and rely on isc-dhcp-client to set up your network and DNS, or pppd if you're using a modem. \ndnsmasq under control of network-manager is intended to speed up DNS look-ups through caching, but if you de-install network-manager, then you'll also get rid of dnsmasq - at least it won't run on its own. You need the regular dnsmasq package to get it starting up and running at boot time.\nYou don't say if you need DHCP or you have static IP addresses. \n\nA: Remove /etc/resolv.conf and make a symbolic link as follows:\n/etc/resolv.conf -> /var/run/resolvconf/interface/NetworkManager\nThat is, execute:\nln -s /var/run/resolvconf/interface/NetworkManager /etc/resolv.conf\n\nLocal DNS in Ubuntu is always a bad idea (resolving domains after 10-15 requests).\n\nA: Adam's answer provides correct background information.\nIf you have edited or removed /etc/resolv.conf then make sure that it is a symbolic link to \"../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf\" before continuing.  If you have to restore this symlink then reboot before continuing.\nIf you have any DNS problems and you don't know what the reason is then it's a good idea to make sure that /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf does not contain the line \"dns=dnsmasq\".  Comment the line out.  This rules out dnsmasq as a possible cause of the problem.\nThe question was \"Why is my DNS slow?\"  If DNS works at all then the configuration must be essentially correct.\nLong delays can be experienced if you have multiple nameservers listed in /etc/resolv.conf and the first listed nameserver does not respond. The glibc resolver(3) tries the first listed nameserver and waits five seconds before trying the next listed nameserver.\nA second question was about the use of \"dns-nameservers\".  Examples of the use of \"dns-nameservers\", etc., can be found in resolvconf(8).

Can anyone explain to me what SNMP is used for in a home Desktop Ubuntu install?\nIs it needed?  There is no network of any kind other than the cable modem.\n\nA: By default SNMP (the agent or monitored device) is not installed on Ubuntu Desktop.\nOnly the SNMP library is installed as it can be used to get the state of a network printer for instance but it is not activated unless the printer driver requests it.\nOverall SNMP (the agent or monitored device) has not much use on a Home Desktop, as you suspected it.\n\nA:                                                  What Is SNMP?\nSimple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an \"Internet-standard protocol for managing devices on IP networks.\" Devices that typically support SNMP include routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, modem racks, and more.\" It is used mostly in network management systems to monitor network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative attention. SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an application layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.  (For more detail )\nTechNet SNMP                 PulseWan\n\nA: SNMP is used to remotely monitor a system. It can also be used to remotely configure a system, if the daemon allows write access, which is rare.  You don't need it if you aren't doing fine-grained analysis of your system state, or central monitoring or configuration management.  (Even without it, a program like Nagios can check to see if a system is up, whether HTTP or SSH services are listening on ports, etc..)\nSometimes it appears as if SNMP libraries or functionality are piggybacking on the installation of other programs, but in reality, unless they touch /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf, you've mis-read the purpose of the files.  For instance, CUPS seems to include an SNMP configuration file, but its purpose is to allow CUPS to find printers on other systems that expose them via SNMP.  \nIf you block UDP on port 161 or restrict the listener to localhost (127.0.0.1 and ::1/128), this will prevent remote querying of your system's information via SNMP. \n\nA: What is SNMP?\nSNMP(Simple Network Management Protocol) \"is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment (eg. routers), computer equipment and even devices like UPSs.\".\nIt is commonly used by network and system administrators to gather operational statistics(such as measuring network bandwidth traffic, cpu usage, or available hard drive space) as well as setting system parameters.\nWhat does this mean for the average desktop user?\nAs the question currently stands, SNMP is of little, or no, interest to the casual desktop user.\nBy default, in Ubuntu, the basic SNMP files (/etc/snmp/snmp.conf for example) are installed. But, they are not enabled, not used at all, and have little significance as far as system security is concerned.\nWhy would I want to enable and use SNMP?\nAs very simple use case for a more advanced(or curious) user would be to set up a monitoring/graphing system like MRTG, Cacti, or Nagios to keep an eye on the health of their systems and network. There are a number of useful questions on this site that go into details on configuring applications that require the use of SNMP.\nThis question is a good starting point to look at some of the many applications that employ SNMP to gather system and network data.\nHow do I enable SNMP on my system?\nSee my answer here.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the file /etc/snmp/snmp.conf and comment out the line containing \"mibs:\"\n\n*Next, assuming you haven't done this already, you will need to\nobtain the full set of IETF MIBs.

If it was not uninstalled properly it can cause weird random issues.  Directions for purging fglrx are available at here. \nIs your video card an AGP model?  If so, a common issue with ati agp cards is having an incorrect AGPMode.  Sometimes you can adjust this setting in your BIOS (which perhaps windows screwed with?)  There is also a setting in /etc/X11/xorg.conf for adjusting it in X.\n\nA: It is not related to Nvidia drivers. Because by default Ubuntu uses non-Nvidia drivers even though you might have Nvidia GPUs. I have an Nvidia GPU too.\nMy Ubuntu used to boot fine until something happened which caused the same issue.

This is usually LightDM:\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\nIf you have trouble getting GDM to start, and this is an installed system rather than a live environment, then you can just reboot and it will start automatically because you configured it as the default display manager. (You should be able to shut down and restart normally. Otherwise, one way to reboot if the GUI is not working properly is to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete while on a virtual console.)\n\nA: Will try to answer the ones I can:\nAssuming the answer by Jokerdino was already checked: The greeter is invalid\nIssues with Nvidia or AMD/ATI graphics\nThis happens when a driver has a problem installing correctly (Most cases). For this do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot PC leaving SHIFT pressed to make the GRUB Menu show.\n\n\n*Select Recovery Mode which will continue booting correctly until the Recovery Menu appeares.\n\n*Select from the recovery menu failsafeX.\n\n\n*In some cases failsafeX will load fine (You lucky dog), for others (Me) it will give  an error along the lines of \"The system is running in low-graphics mode\" and will stay there forever. When this happens, press CTRL+ALT+F1 to go to the terminal. Type in your Username and Password.\n\n\n*Reinstall the drivers depending on your case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nvidia\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current - More stable/tested version\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates - More up-to-date version\nFor other cases see this answer for details and follow the links there to help you along the way.\n\n*AMD/ATI\nThe simple way is to sudo apt-get install fglrx. If this does not work keep reading.\nGo to AMDs support site and download the driver you need. (If you have a newer card, you may want to download be the latest beta driver instead of the stable one. You would need to compare release dates and read through release notes to find out which driver version supports which chips.) Put the downloaded driver in some folder and rename it to \"amd-gpu.run\" to simplify name. Go to the folder where you downloaded the file and type chmod +x amd-gpu.run to give it Executable Permission. Now just simply run ./sh amd-gpu.run and follow the onscreen steps.\nAfter rebooting all problems should be solved. If you test 'Additional Drivers' with a problem like this it will finish downloading the package but then it will give an error. It also gives the same error if you use 'Software Center' and 'Synaptic'. The only way was to go to the failsafeX option and do the workaround about changing to the tty1 terminal and doing it via command line.\nNote that if the problem occured after installing an unsupported driver from the amd site then you may have to first delete the driver you had installed. For this, run in the tty session (i.e) in the terminal screen you get after pressing CTRL+ALT+F1 :\nsudo aticonfig --uninstall\n\n(If this command didnt work then check this site . Look under the \"Uninstalling the AMD Catalyst™ Proprietary Driver\" heading.) After doing this, you may reboot with the command :\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nNow you must get back access to the Unity desktop(Of course with the AMD driver uninstalled). Then you can get to this site which clearly helps in choosing the right AMD driver for your System specifications. Also read the release notes for the latest driver for your graphic card(Especially check if your system satisfies all the system requirements). Then after downloading your driver installer(the .zip file) get to this site and follow the instructions to install your driver. Your driver must be installed and it should work successfully. \nI also need to add that I do not recommend downloading the Drivers from the Nvidia site since they:\n * Might create additional problems with Ubuntu\n * Are not updated automatically\n * Are not tested thoroughly in Ubuntu\n\nAlways use the nvidia-current package or the nvidia-current-updates one. These are tested and approved already for the Ubuntu version you are using and will give less errors and incompatibility bugs.\nIssues with Intel graphics\nFor Intel it is recommended to do the following after doing all the steps mentioned above but before installing anything (When you are in the Terminal). You can choose Xorg-Edgers which is a PPA that brings many improvements, latest video drivers and more:\nWarning: This PPA is very unstable for some things. So do it with that in mind.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa -y\nAfter that sudo apt-get update and you should receive several updates. X-Swat currently does not have Intel drivers in the latest versions of Ubuntu.\n\nUpdate log\nUPDATE 1: Added this extensive answer to solve many of the problems that might end with the error mentioned here: How do I install the Nvidia drivers?\nUPDATE 2: AMD is no longer releasing (stable) graphics drivers on a monthly basis and not all graphics chips are supported by their Linux drivers upon product release. At the time of this update the latest stable driver is almost 5 months older than the latest beta driver. You should look at the release notes to check if there is a driver that supports your graphics chip and the software versions you are using (X.org xserver or Mir).\n\nLike always please test and give feedback so I can enhance my answer since others will be also reading it. The better it is, the more people it will help.\n\nA: Only for ATI graphics cards\nWhen the message that \"your system is running in low-graphics mode\" appears:\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F1 to see the terminal one. Then login with your credentials, and then run the following commands:   \nsudo apt-get install fglrx    \nsudo reboot\n\nThe same can be done from the recovery mode (after enabling networking), if your Ubuntu completly refuses to enter anything but recovery mode.\n\nA: Follow these commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -d install --reinstall gdm\nsudo apt-get remove --purge gdm\n\n(I ran this command above, but was told by the system to use   # sudo apt-get autoremove  instead, after the  #sudo apt-get remove --purge gdm    command.) \nsudo apt-get install gdm\n\nselect GDM when prompted\nsudo reboot\n\nThat fixed it for me :)\nIt took very long to start after the reboot, 10+ mins. But I got in eventually.\n\nA: I have recently received a similar issue with myPangolin Performance laptop.

I also had the propriety ATi/AMD driver installed from 11.10, which carried over to the 12.04 installation. I followed this guide to remove the proprietary drivers and use the Open Source drivers. http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Oneiric_Installation_Guide#Removing_Catalyst.2Ffglrx\nEverything seems to be working now. \n\nA: You need to install the kernel headers manually then reinstall nvidia for some reason then the nvidia drivers will work\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on a Toshiba Portege R100. I got this error after the first bootup after install. After downloading and updating the graphics driver (Trident Cyberblade), what worked for me was creating a driver-specific .conf file as described in this Arch-Linux wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Trident.\n\nA: I fixed this problem by creating a new xorg.conf file (copying the text from xorg.conf.failsafe).\nDetails:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/296217/55223\n\nA: I fixed this problem by removing /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority manually.\nYou can also try deleting the file ~/.Xauthority and rebooting.\n\nA: I had the “The system is running in low-graphics mode” error after trying to upgrade my Acer Aspire 4810T with Intel GM45 Express Chipset graphics from a 64bit 13.04 to a 64bit 13.10. \nI had less than 2 gigabytes of free disk space when I started the upgrade. I faced first anomalies already before the reboot. The upgrade window showing the progress showed that everything has been downloaded and installed but it never closed. Couldn't close it even manually.\nThen, after reboot, I got the “The system is running in low-graphics mode” error window.\nI tried to solve the problem as proposed above by Luis Alvarado, user41938,  community wiki, Azul Mascara and David M. Sousa. \nMy guess is that my problem was related to tiny disk space as hinted by Azul Mascara. But just freeing disk space and even allocating more by repartitioning didn't help. \nAfter struggling more than enough with the problem I decided to download the 13.10 64bit and make a bootable USB stick with it. I booted the laptop with the USB stick and selected the installation on top of the old 13.10 (non-functioning) system that the installer recognized. This fixed my problem.\n\nA: First, type the following commands:\n$ lspci | grep -i VGA\n$ lspci | grep -i amd\n\nFor me (HP pavilion 15n003tx, Saucy), the outputs were:\ntest@HP-Pavilion-15:/etc/X11$ lspci | grep -i VGA\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\ntest@HP-Pavilion-15:/etc/X11$ lspci | grep -i amd\n0a:00.0 Display controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Sun XT [Radeon HD 8670A/8670M/8690M]\n\nSince the AMD device doesn't come as output in the first command, even if you install amd drivers, you'll probably end up with the following error in /var/log/Xorg.0.log:\n[    12.873] (II) fglrx(0): Invalid ATI BIOS from int10, the adapter is not VGA-enabled\n\nHence, I followed the steps:\ntest@HP-Pavilion-15:/etc/X11$ sudo apt-get purge fglrx*\ntest@HP-Pavilion-15:/etc/X11$ cp /etc/Xorg/xorg.conf.failsafe /etc/xorg.conf\n\nThe contents of xorg.conf.failsafe are:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"Configured Video Device\"\n    Driver      \"fbdev\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier  \"Configured Monitor\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier  \"Default Screen\"\n    Monitor     \"Configured Monitor\"\n    Device      \"Configured Video Device\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: This one worked for me using ubuntu 13.10, my ubuntu stopped working after installing opencv. \nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-304 nvidia-current nvidia-libopencl1-304 nvidia-settings \n\nJust purge all the nvidia-* and restart \nI am not a geek just a layman don't know the reason why it works.\n\nA: I have the same problem (The system is running in low-graphics mode) when I reboot the system connected to an Oculus Rift (1080x1920 monitor). If I reboot the machine and connect a monitor of (1920x1080 resolution) it works ok.\nThe machine has Ubuntu 14.04 and Nvidia 970, driver 346 and kernel 3.15. With the default lightdm configuration (autologin activated).\nThe problem started suddenly, without making major changes in Ubuntu configuration.\nI had the same issue in another machine with nvidia 970, same version of Ubuntu / different kernel. On this machine the problem happened when changing from autologin to login with user/pw in lightm and it was solved rebooting the machine with a 1920x1080 monitor connected and enabling autologin again.\n\nA: For me this problem occurred after upgrading from \"Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\" plus TDE to \"Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\" plus TDE. TDE is the trinity desktop environment (trinitydesktop.org). The cause of the error was that\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/X11/default-display-manager pointed to lightdm although during the upgrade I told it to use tdm-trinity as default.\n\n*lightdm was broken (and I don't care why).\n\n\nThe fix was to run dpkg-reconfigure tdm-trinity and to choose tdm-trinity as my default.\nA few days later the problem came back and again /etc/X11/default-display-manager pointed to lightdm, don't know why.\n\nA: Different users solved their in different ways (since the causes of the problem were different for different people). I am describing what caused the problem in my desktop and how did I solve it.\nWARNING: My method will work on your computer only if the cause of the problem is the same. Nevertheless read my reply to develop a general understanding.\nCause of the problem:\nI made some changes to the file\n/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nAfter I rebooted I encountered the 'system-is-running-in-low-graphics-mode' error. Clearly the changes made to the above 'lightdm.conf' file needed to be undone.\nHow did I solve it:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the error message appears, press Ctrl+Alt+F1, then login using your ubuntu username and password.\n\n*Go to the directory /etc/lightdm/ (cd /etc/lightdm/). Open the above file in vim using vim lightdm.conf. Vim opens the file in the terminal itself. \n\n*Undo the changes that caused the problem. In my case I removed a line that I had added (which caused the problem). Save and quit vim. Following this step requires you to know how to use vim editor to edit files. If you are unfamiliar with vim watch tutorials on how to open a file, edit a file, save and quit a file in vim. \n\n*Reboot the computer. The problem is gone!\nPS: I undid the change that caused the error. Your cause of error could be completely different from mine. So, blindly following my answer definitely won't help. On the other hand it may damage your computer. \n\nA: I got this error after upgrading from 14.04 to 15.10 (and then to 16.04). For some reason the /var/lib/lightdm directory was missing.\nTo fix the issue, first, create the directory:\nsudo mkdir -p /var/lib/lightdm\nsudo chown -R lightdm:lightdm /var/lib/lightdm\nsudo chmod 0750 /var/lib/lightdm\n\nThen create the .Xauthority file:\nsudo touch /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority\nsudo chown lightdm:lightdm /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority\n\nMore details:\nMost of the solutions revolve around ATI or NVidia drivers, but I just have an Intel integrated graphics chip, so that wasn't the issue.\nI discovered the actual problem by looking at the greeter log:\n$ sudo cat /var/log/lightdm/x-0-greeter.log\nError writing X authority: Failed to open X authority /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority: No such file or directory\n\nIndeed, the /var/lib/lightdm was absent. Just creating the empty directory (as recommended in another question's answer) resulted in the same error, but after creating the .Xauthority file, the system booted fine\nEdit: Just found this question that has two answers: one recommending creating the directory, the other recommending creating the file. As I said, I needed to do both.\n\nA: I face this error almost 100 times.\n  **1.Go to tty mode (ctrl + alt + F1)**\n\n   2. Login with the existing user credentials.\n   3. Run the single command **(  sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade )**\n   4. Reboot\n\n\nA: I started seeing this error after upgrading to Ubuntu 17.10.\nFrom a text console, I changed GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub to \"nosplash nomodeset\" so I could see the boot messages and ran sudo update-grub.\nUpon reboot I saw that it was the \"GNOME display manager\" that had failed. Hey, wasn't I using LightDM? After running sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm to switch back from GDM3 to LightDM, it worked fine.\n\nA: I had the same problem on a 16.04 box with Intel integrated graphics this morning and found my way here. What worked for me:\nWhen presented with the low-graphics-mode message at boot and unable to click \"OK\", I pressed Ctrl + Alt + F1 to bring up the terminal (in glorious full-screen text mode), and logged in.\nI was going to follow the steps to reinstall the whole desktop, but then I noticed there were updates available. sudo apt update revealed that kernel updates were among them, and sudo apt upgrade installed the updates. Then sudo shutdown -r now to reboot.\nAnd the problem went away. Probably some kind of bug with a previous version of the kernel. The recent change that I made that may have brought this on was installing a larger VGA monitor with a native resolution of 1680 x 1050. Anyway, everything seems to be fine now.\n\nA: The only solution that worked for me is to switch lightdm to gdm:\nsudo apt-get install gdm3\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3\n\nsystemctl stop lightdm\nsystemctl start gdm3\n\n\nA: Reconfigure your display manager\nRun \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure sddm\nreplacing sddm with you display manager (https://wiki.debian.org/DisplayManager), and choose one from the list that will be shown.\n\nA: Yet another cause -- memory upgrade!\nI have system with both Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 10 installed.  Both 64-bit, of course.  It had been working just fine (well fine-ish) with only 8 GB of RAM installed.  I decided to upgrade it to 32 GB (the max supported by the motherboard).  After installing the new RAM, of course I booted memtest86 and tested the new memory very thoroughly: no errors after more than 24 hours of running the test.  I booted Windows and it showed 32 GB of memory and had no issues.  I booted into Ubuntu and got the \"system is running in low graphics mode\".\nNothing had changed except for the additional memory!\nAny number of articles on the web -- here at askubuntu and elsewhere -- claim that if you have 64-bit kernels, no settings changes should be necessary when you upgrade memory; it should just work.\nIt was not a problem of having too-small a swap partition for the larger memory.  That was one of the first things I checked.  When the OS was installed a 90 GB swap partition had been created, which is more than enough.\nAfter wasting about a day checking various things, what finally worked for me was to:\n\n*\n\n*reboot into recovery mode\n\n*rerun the \"mkswap\" utility to re-initialize the swap partition.\n\n*reboot\n\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for details on how much swap space is needed and how to use the mkswap utility.\nI can only guess that when it saw the expanded memory, the kernel decided that the page size of the swap file should have a new value, and that did not match whatever whatever the page size was when the swp partition was initialized.  So then virtual memory failed to enable, and somehow that led to a cascade of failures.\n", "Q: How to reset my password without rebooting? I lost my password to a VM running 11.04, but have ssh access via public key authentication.\nIs there any way I can reset the password without a reboot? (This is to avoid downtime of services it's running.)\n\nA: You can if you:\n\n\n*\n\n*know a root password, do su - and enter root password.\nBut authenticating directly as the root account is disabled by default (and unsupported, though possible) in Ubuntu, so you may not be able to do this.\n\n*have sudo access without password, do sudo passwd youruser.\n\n*can log in to another administrative account, and then use sudo in that account to change the password for your first account.\n\n*can perform actions with PolicyKit (e.g., via psexec) without entering your password. This is very unlikely, but it's easy to try. Try psexec passwd youruser.\nBasically you need to get root access somehow.\nIf you have access to VM console you have root permissions there (e.g. for XEN: xm console vm-name).\nTheoretically at least, you could make a copy of the VM, mount the drive of the (non-running) copy, dump the password hashes from /etc/shadow, and crack them, to discover your password. If you remember some things about your password, then a good password cracking program (which tend to be proprietary payware) should be able to use that information to avoid checking for passwords that can't be it.\nBut unless your password is really simple, or you know a lot about it and are experienced dumping and cracking password hashes, and also unless the need to avoid downtime is extreme, you should not attempt something like this. (In fact, I mainly bring it up for completeness, so you can see that the reasonable options really have been exhausted.) Instead, if you cannot become root in the VM and you cannot use the VM console, you should just reboot the VM, boot into recovery mode, and reset the password.\n", "Q: RTL8190 wireless card unclaimed I have recently installed Ubuntu and I'm having problems with my (RTL8190) card. \nI followed the steps listed here - Ubuntu Help: Troubleshooting Wireless.\nAfter using the command sudo lshw -C network I got the following output: \n*-network         \ndescription: Ethernet interface\nproduct: RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller\nvendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\nphysical id: 0\nbus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\nlogical name: eth0\nversion: 06\nserial: 10:78:d2:73:9f:0d\nsize: 10Mbit/s\ncapacity: 1Gbit/s\nwidth: 64 bits\nclock: 33MHz\ncapabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix vpd bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\nconfiguration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI duplex=half firmware=rtl_nic/rtl8168e-2.fw latency=0 link=no multicast=yes port=MII speed=10Mbit/s\nresources: irq:42 ioport:d800(size=256) memory:f8fff000-f8ffffff memory:f8ff8000-f8ffbfff\n\n*-network UNCLAIMED\ndescription: Network controller\nproduct: RTL8190 802.11n Wireless LAN\nvendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\nphysical id: 1\nbus info: pci@0000:04:01.0\nversion: 00\nwidth: 32 bits\nclock: 33MHz\ncapabilities: pm bus_master cap_list\nconfiguration: latency=64 maxlatency=64 mingnt=32\nresources: ioport:e800(size=256) memory:fbfff000-fbffffff\n\nI proceeded to install the ndisgtk package and downloaded the net819xp.inf driver. \nUsing the windows wireless drivers app, I selected the .inf file but it said there was an error.

I am having a problem booting Win7\nWhen I boot the computer the first screen I get is the GRUB boot manager screen which has menu entries for Ubuntu and Windows 8. If I want to boot into Windows 7 I have to select the Windows 8 loader and then select Windoes 7 from the windows boot menu. \nDue to the Win8 loader being a little silly it then reboots the pc in order to load Win7, however it just takes me back to the GRUB2 and I have to select the Win8 loader again and then Win7 will boot. This is faily long winded and unecessary.\nI would much prefer it if I could just add Windows 7 to the GRUB menu and select it from there rather than boot Windows 8, select Windows 7, and reboot again. \nMy only concern being that Windows 8 has removed/replaced the Win7 bootloader. \nHas anyone come across this problem?\n\nA: create entry in 40_custom(don't remove anything) in directory /etc/grub.d\ngksudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom \n\nadd an entry like this\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n    set root=(hd0,3)\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\nModify the set root value of course. Determine the hdd by typing: sudo fdisk -l . For example, /dev/sda1 is (hd0,1) if its on the second HDD: /dev/sdb1 >> (hd1,1)..and so on. You can understand the syntax from this I guess. After you made the modifications, do sudo update-grub and you can try to boot it. BTW grub actually can't boot windows the only thing it can do is to chainload(to call) windows bootloader.\n\nA: In the W8 loader, go to the options, and change the default boot to W7. Then boot into W7 once and reboot. Then your grub install should be able to see both. Worked for me.\n\nA: I have no idea what is going on with Windows 8. I installed a virtual machine with the three operating systems as you described and the exact same thing happened. It should not happen. I can not explain why it happens. But it did.\nThe way I was able to change this behavior (in my VM) was by installing EasyBCD (in Windows 7) and then doing an update/save of the Windows boot menu. (See screenshot below.)  \n\nIn my case merely \"updating\" the Windows Boot Menu with EasyBCD ... even without changing anything in the menu ... removed the Windows 8 menu and weirdness. After I did this when I selected the Windows 8 entry in the GRUB boot menu, the old style of the Windows boot menu shown in the screenshot below is displayed. And selecting Windows 7 now starts Win 7 directly without a reboot back to GRUB.\n \n", "Q: Preventing users from changing pinned applications in the launcher?

If you want to install a second operating system on your computer (called a dual-boot or multiboot configuration), you need to create another partition on the hard disk, and then install the additional operating system on the new partition. Your hard disk would then have one system partition and two boot partitions. (A system partition is the partition that contains the hardware-related files. These tell the computer where to look to start Windows.)\nTo create a partition on a basic disk, there must be unallocated disk space on your hard disk.

The second attempt seems to have more errors. I'm not sure what happened with it, but the first pastebin seems to have been collected with no problems so that is the one I am using.\nWhat I believe you said you want to do is install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS alongside Windows 7 on your HP Pavilion 64k desktop computer. According to your BootInfo summary you have a 1000 GB WDC WD10EADS-65M hard drive which currently contains the 3 Windows NTFS primary partitions shown below.\nPartition  Boot  Start Sector    End Sector  # of Sectors   ~Size     Partition Label\n/dev/sda1    *          2,048       174,079       172,032   88.1 MB   \"SYSTEM\"\n/dev/sda2             206,848 1,929,785,343 1,929,578,496  988   GB   \"HP\"\n/dev/sda3       1,929,785,344 1,953,122,303    23,336,960   11.9 GB   \"FACTORY_IMAGE\"\n\nThis is my guess as to the function of each of these three partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*\"SYSTEM\" is the Windows boot partition. It contains the windows bootloader which will display the Windows boot menu. Windows starts up by first booting this partition and then transfering control to the code in 'sda2', \"HP\", your Windows 7 partition.\nThe \"SYSTEM\" partition is apparently the one which you attempted to shrink to free up space on your drive to install Ubuntu. However, this partition is too small for this. Shrinking it will not provide enough space to install Ubuntu. \n\n*\"HP\" contains your Windows 7 operating system. It uses most of the space on the drive. If you want to free up space to install Ubuntu, this is the partition to shrink.\n\n*\"FACTORY_IMAGE\" is your system (Windows) recovery partition.\nBe very careful to avoid damaging this partition!\nThis partition contains whatever software HP has provided for restoring your computer's software to the state it was in when HP manufactured it. If you ever need to re-install Windows to this computer, you would use the software in this partition.\n\n\nWhat I suggest you try is to shrink your second, \"HP\", partition by 10 to 40 GB and then try one more time to install Ubuntu. \nI agree with the previous recommendation that you should first run chkdsk against your Windows (C:\\) partition. (You will need to reboot to do this.)\nThen shrink the \"HP\" partition in Windows by following the steps listed in your question.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*In Disk Management, right-click the simple or spanned volume you want to shrink.\n  \n*Right-click on the largest partition, which should be labeled \"HP\", and select Shrink Volume\n  \n*Follow the instructions on your screen.\n  \n*If you are unsure how much room to free up and at this time only want to experiment with Ubuntu, then I suggest you shrink the volume\n  by between 10 to 40 GB (10,240 to 40,960 MB).\n  \n\nAfter completing the above, try installing Ubuntu again using your \"Ubuntu 12.04 LTS amd64\" install CD and see what type of an install is recommended. If you are still having problems, you can update your question here to get further suggestions on how to proceed.\n\nUpdate Requesting BootInfo summary (May 26)\nI cannot tell from the information you have provided what is happening on your computer. But if you have unallocated space then you should be able to install Ubuntu into it. We just need to figure out how your computer is currently set up so that we can suggest the proper way to accomplish this.\nCould you please look over the steps below to see if it is something you could do? The steps below describe how to install and run a utility called Boot-Repair. You can use this tool to create a Bootinfo summary containing information about how your disk is partitioned.\nNote: The steps below assume you have booted your Ubuntu 12.04 install CD (or USB) and selected Try Ubuntu to use a \"Live Session\". Any software you install during a Live Session will disappear after you reboot your computer. Nothing is installed on your computer's hard drive.\n\nUsing \"boot-repair\" in a Try Ubuntu Live CD Session to provide a BootInfo summary. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your Ubuntu 12.04 LTS desktop install CD and select Try Ubuntu.  \n\n*When the Ubuntu desktop appears, open a terminal window. (You can use the keyboard shortcut CtrlAlt+T to do this.)\n\n*Your Live CD session needs to be connected to the Internet for the remaining steps below to work. If your network is not connected, then try clicking on the connection in the Network Indicator's menu in the upper right-hand of the desktop. (See example below.)\n  \n\n*Enter the commands below one at a time into the terminal window. These commands use the system tool apt-get to install the boot-repair tool.   \n\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair \n\nNote: If you display this answer in your Live CD session's Firefox browser then you can copy a command into the clipboard and then paste it into the terminal. You can use the keyboard shortcut ShiftCtrl+V to paste into a terminal window.\n\n\n*After the commands above complete, enter the command boot-repair to start the tool.\n\n*After a slight delay, boot-repair will prompt you to download the newest version. Since you just installed the latest version, answer No.\n\n*If boot-repair asks to install the pastebinit package, respond with Yes.\n\n*The tool will now scan your system and (eventually) display the window shown in the example below. Click on the Create a Bootinfo summary box/button. This will collect information about your system's boot configuration, but will not make any changes.\n\n\n  \n\n*When the bootinfo summary has been created, boot-repair will display a message containing a URL which should look like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/123456/. \n\nImportant: Please update/edit your question and add this URL. The information in the pastebin this link points to will help us to understand what is happening on your computer.\n\n\nOriginal Response (May 25)\nIf you create a partition in Windows, a New Simple Volume as you refer to it, then Ubuntu will NOT use it. Ubuntu will only attempt to install into space that is considered \"unallocated\".\nIf there is insufficient unallocated space on your drive, then the Ubuntu installer will probably suggest trying to modify one of you existing partitions to create space it can install into. Since you have already done this, I think you do not want to do this.\nDo NOT let the Ubuntu installer erase your disk to install Ubuntu.\nThis will permanently delete your Windows installation.\n\nA: If you made a new partition via windows (or any other means) and then went to install ubuntu onto that clean partition and it some how corrupted.

In the business environment I work in, we tried to use Puppet to manage both our Linux and Windows machines.

Is there another program or way to do this?\n\nA: Cfengine might be an alternative. You could also check this list of alternatives to puppet.\n\nA: Salt is a remote execution and configuration management tool.  Salt also has support for Windows.  Salt is created using Python. However, Python knowledge is not required to perform most of the tasks.

Each disk has several partitions: one for swap, the others paired in several /dev/mdX arrays.\nEvery couple of years one of the disks dies and is replaced.  The replacement typically goes something like this:\n# copy partition table from the remaining good disk to the empty replacement disk\n# (instead of /dev/good_disk and /dev/new_disk I use /dev/sda and /dev/sdb, as appropriate)\nsfdisk -d /dev/good_disk | sfdisk /dev/new_disk\n\n# install boot loader\ngrub-install /dev/new_disk\n\n# create swap partition reusing the same UUID, so I don't need to edit /etc/fstab\nmkswap /dev/new_disk1 -U xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n# hot-add the new partitions to my RAID arrays\nmdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/new_disk2\nmdadm /dev/md1 -a /dev/new_disk5\nmdadm /dev/md2 -a /dev/new_disk6\nmdadm /dev/md3 -a /dev/new_disk7\nmdadm /dev/md4 -a /dev/new_disk8\n\nThe disks were originally partitioned with cfdisk back in 2009, and so the partition table is aligned traditionally to cylinder boundaries (255 heads * 63 sectors).  This is not the optimum configuration for new 4K-sector drives.\nMy question is: how can I create a set of partitions for the new disk and ensure they're properly aligned, and have correct sizes for my RAID arrays (rounding up is acceptable, I suppose, but rounding down is definitely not)?\n\nA: I just had to replace the mirror in one of my arrays today, and I opted to just fdisk the replacement instead of using sfdisk.  Since I know the partition sizes (its just one, in my case) and I went with a bigger drive for the replacement.\nOriginal is RAID1 of a pair of ST31500341AS, and replacement disk is an ST2000DL003.\nSo, what I did was:\n\n\n*\n\n*mdadm /dev/md6 --fail /dev/sde1\n\n*mdadm /dev/md6 --remove /dev/sde1\n\n*replace /dev/sde\n\n*fdisk /dev/sde\n\n\n*\n\n*c\n\n*u\n\n*n\n\n*p\n\n*1\n\n*enter (for 2048)\n\n*3907028736\n\n*t\n\n*fd\n\n*w\n\n\nThis results in new partition with start 2048 and end 3907029167 - for 1953513560 blocks (or 244189195 in 4k blocks) 3907028904 - for 1953513428 blocks (244189178 in 4k blocks).  The old partition was start 63 and end 2930272064 with 1465136001 blocks.  I think lvm takes care of being aligned with the space, so it should all be good.\nForgot that I can't go all the way to the end of the disk, otherwise mdadm will switch to using the whole disk rather than the partition on reboot.  LVM seems to tolerate this shift, but putting a filesystem directly onto the MD didn't.  Recommendation was to shorten the partition by at least 256 sectors, so I did (3907029167-256)/8*8 in bc to get 3907028904.  Resulting partition is mod 8 == 0, and short by 263 sectors.  This problem got me when I did this for another array :(\n\n*mdadm /dev/md6 --add /dev/sde1\n\n*watch the array rebuild.  Seems to be rebuilding at a pretty good speed, seems faster than it was with the old drive.\n\n*and then remove and readd the other side, so that the superblocks will match.\n\nA: I'll post my solution, with which I'm profoundly unhappy:\n\n\n*\n\n*sfdisk -d /dev/good_disk > /root/part.txt\n\n*vi /root/part.txt\n\n*Increase partition start numbers until they're all multiples of 8 (8 sectors of 512 bytes = 4K).\n\n*Increase the size of the extended partition until it covers the entire new disk (which is 1 TB, while the old disk was 500 GB -- when the other disk dies and is replaced, I'll be able to create a new RAID array in the leftover free space.)\n\n*sfdisk /dev/new_disk < /root/part.txt -L (the -L makes it accept partitions not aligned to cylinder boundaries, otherwise sfdisk aborts without changing anything).\nI don't like it because it's error-prone and tedious.\n\nA: As you said, you can allign it to multiples of 8 and you can do it error prone with GNU parted. I will assume /dev/sda is the old good disk and /dev/sdb will be the new one with 4k sector size.\nsudo parted /dev/sda unit s print\n\nWrite down partition sizes. And round them up to 8. We'll use rounded numbers here.\nsudo parted --align minimal /dev/sdb\nunit s\nprint\nmktable msdos\nmkpart primary 64s <64+sda1-1>s\nalign-check minimal 1\nmkpart primary <64+sda1>s <64+sda1+sda2-1>s\nalign-check minimal 2\nmkpart primary <64+sda1+sda2>s <64+sda1+sda2+sda3-1>s\nalign-check minimal 3\n\nand so on\nIf you have more than 4 partitions, you will have to set the fourth partition as \"extended\" and the remaining partitions define as \"logical\".\nMark you raid partitions with label raid\ntoggle 1 raid\ntoggle 2 raid\n\nand so on\nprint\nquit\n\n", "Q: Keep getting messages about internal system errors I keep getting popups about internal system errors (see screenshot below) on irregular intervals (several times a day), that I don't know what to do about. If I continue through the dialog and try to report the error back to the Ubuntu project, I get a message stating that development on this version of Ubuntu has been completed, and that I should ask for help here if I don't know what to do about it.\nI don't.\n\nIf I show the details of the error message, the \"executable path\" parameter shows /usr/share/apport/apport-gpu-error-intel.py.\nIs this a bug I should report to Launchpad, or just a configuration error somewhere? If it's a bug, how do I collect the data I (and the devs) need?\nUpdate in response to comment: I am running an ASUS N53SN, sporting an Intel Core i7 2630QM CPU and an NVidia GeForce 550M GPU.\n\nA: Potential Reason for These Unreportable Errors\nI think I've figured this out.  I think that this particular bug reporting avenue is a hangover from the alpha and beta development stages--when the developers wanted as many bug reports as possible, regardless of whether the user was willing to file a full launchpad bug report or not.  Once 12.04 was released, the developers no longer wanted anonymous bug reports so they disable this ability.  They only want bug reports that the user themselves manually takes the time to file.\nThis is understandable but I would consider it a bug that apport/ubuntu-bug is presenting the user with non-actionable information.  When development stops and they no longer want a high volume of bug-reports turning off automatic bug reporting is one thing, but leaving the user without a path (at the very least a link) to report to launchpad, and without a way to save the information contained within the bug report should be rethought.\nMy Solution to Non-Actionable Error Reports\nI know what I am going to do next time I get one of these unreportable/unsavable errors.  I'm going to take a screenshot of the window, run apport-bug apport and file a bug saying that apport should not present the user with non-actionable information.  At the very least the user should be able to save the report for their own use or for manually reporting a bug.\nHow to Proceed Regarding your GPU Bug\nAs for your problem, apport was running a script to debug GPU problems.\nIf you aren't actually noticing problems with your GPU other than these error messages I'd say you can safely ignore them.\nIf you are seeing any weird graphics related behavior, keep an eye on your logs--specifically xorg.0.log and syslog, but maybe the kernel logs as well.  If you are noticing errors copy them down, and try to make a best guess (or ask) whether it is a driver problem, kernel problem or X11 problem.  Then use apport to file the bug against what you determine to be the best package (for example for my nvidia driver I would enter apport-bug nvidia-current-updates), be as detailed as you can be in the resulting bug report and put the symptoms you experience and any errors you noticed into the description when you file the bug.  More information about filing bugs is here and here.  Good luck.\n\nA: Go ahead and run xdiagnose. Uncheck \"Enable automatic crash bug reporting\". You will never going to be bothered again by those messages.\n\nA: If you're having NVidia drivers and experiencing frequent crashes and frozen desktops, try to switch to propitiatory NVidia driver instead of open source one.\n\nA: This may help. Open the GParted program and check if the you see an error message on one of the Ubuntu partitions. \nI recently wiped my mac partitions and installed Ubuntu on my hard drive.

After the partitioner level, the installation gives this: \nwarning: file:///cmrom/pool/main/c/coreutils/coreutils_8.5-1ubuntu6_amd64.deb was corrupted. \nShould I download another server file? Or is there another way to solve this problem? Thanks in advance\n\nA: First, I would check the MD5SUM of the .iso you downloaded, to make sure that isn't corrupted. Here is a link to a tool to check the MD5SUM on Windows: http://www.georgejopling.co.uk/md5check/md5check.html and here is a link to the MD5SUMs of the current .iso's to compare against: http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/MD5SUMS. If the MD5SUMs don't match, redownload your iso, because that is the problem.\nIf everything looks gravy, I'd just try and recreate the flash drive installer.\n\nA: Since the warning says that the coreutils package was corrupted, you should probably download a new iso image of Ubuntu. But one thing that you should try before downloading a new iso image, is to check the checksum of the file you have with ou now, to ensure that it is not corrupted-\nAssuming that you are using ubuntu-12.04-server-amd64.iso\nthe SHA1 checksum is:\nf44b5f8fc9d56e8fd7599e9c1677a640dda85eda\nand the MD5 checksum is:\nf2e921788d35bbdf0336d05d228136eb\nCourtesy:http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/MD5SUMS and \nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/SHA1SUMS\n", "Q: How to make the clock sync automatically after suspension of a Virtual Machine I run Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit as a guest OS on a VMWare Player machine over Windows 7.

When I turn the Ubuntu on again, the clock is no longer in sync with the real system clock.\nHow can I make the clock to auto sync when the system is resumed from suspension?\n\nA: I believe this is a function of the open-vm-tools package.

When I run the live CD installer, the installation gets stuck at \"select a picture for the specified account.\" I've found that is an incompatibility problem with my webcam and the only way to fix this is running the Terminal command:\nsudo modprobe -r uvcvideogp\n\nThis must be run before doing the installation. But because its a live cd, I don't know exactly how to do that. I've tried opening the terminal normally and executing this command, but I open the setup and still stuck.\nHow can I run this command in a Terminal on the live CD?\n\nA: Select the option Try Ubuntu without installing from the boot menu when you start up the live CD, instead of the Install Ubuntu option. Then you boot into a usable Ubuntu desktop which runs as 'live.' From the desktop, you can open the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run this command. Then when you're done in the Terminal, start the Install process by double-clicking the Install Ubuntu icon on the desktop.\nThat is the best way to do it. But if you ever need to enter a command after you've already selected Install Ubuntu instead of Try Ubuntu without installing, then you can run it in a virtual console. Press Ctrl+Alt+F1, and you'll get a text-based screen where you can enter commands. Press Alt+F7 to return to the graphical user interface. Commands that are doing work in the one virtual console (e.g., the 1st one, accessed with Ctrl+Alt+F1) will continue to run even after you've switched to a different virtual console (or back to the GUI).\n", "Q: YouTube movies are playing too fast with chrome I've got movies playing in fast forward in YouTube HTML 5 mode if I play it in Google Chrome.

I have configured powernap to hibernate (i.e., suspend-to-disk) the machine if idle.

Unfortunately, this setting gets lost after resuming from hibernate.\nI'd like to run these hdparm command right after the system has resumed. How/Where to install them?\n\nA: You can do this by creating a script in /etc/pm/sleep.d\nsudo nano /etc/pm/sleep.d/99_hdparm_thaw\n\nUse this as your base:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nPATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin\n\ncase \"${1}\" in\n        hibernate)\n                # this is where you put something you want to run before hibernating\n                ;;\n        resume|thaw)\n                # this is where you put something you want to run on resume/thaw\n                ;;\nesac\n\nYou will then need to make sure it is executable:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/99_hdparm_thaw\n\nThere are other scripts in that directory, which is where I came up with the base. You may be able to use those for ideas.\nAlso, those scripts are run in alphabetical order. This is why I chose to name it 99_hdparm_thaw, so it will be the last run script.\n", "Q: Installation of GRUB boot loader to hard disk fails I am installing Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS on an IBM 3650 M2 with a hardware raid5 with three partitions:\nsda1 /boot - 1 GB, ext3\nsda2 lvm - 1 TB, ext4\nsda3 swap - 24GB\n\nDuring the GRUB installation, I get a message that the installer failed to load GRUB on a hard disk and get sent back to the installer menu.\n\nA: Please provide more information about why the GRUB install failed.\nIt is hard to suggest possible solutions when no information is available about why GRUB failed to install.

Make sure to edit LANG1 and LANG2 to be the keyboard layout codes you need.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nLANG1=\"us\"\nLANG2=\"de\"\nCURRENT_LANG=$(setxkbmap -query | tail -n 1 | cut -f6 -d ' ')\nif [ \"$CURRENT_LANG\" = $LANG1 ]; then\n    setxkbmap $LANG2\nelse\n    setxkbmap $LANG1\nfi\n\nmake the file by right-clicking on it -> \"Properties\" -> \"Permissions\" tab, then select \"Allow executing file as program.\nNow, open \"System Settings\" -> \"Keyboard\" -> \"Shortcuts\" tab and select \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the + button on the bottom and name the shortcut \"Keyboard Toggle\" or whatever you want, really. Then give the full path to the script you made earlier in the command box. Hit Apply. Click where it says \"Disabled\" then you can set the shortcut to whatever you want by clicking your key combination!\nOne more thing. I don't think it will let you set it to a single key, like \"\", you may have to do SHIFT+ or something like that. \n\nA: First: Thank you so much Reverendj1 for your script -- you rock!  I've been struggling to find an answer as to why the \"key(s) to change layout\" selections are being totally ignored. As Dimitris said, it's not an answer, but it's a good work around.\nImportant:\nI did have to change one things on your script.\n-- In 12.04 my final line of the setxkbmap -query output prints \"options:    grp:...\".  So, I used a pipe to grep \"layout\"  instead of the \"tail -n1\" command.  So the script looks as such:\n\n#!/bin/bash\nLANG1=\"us\"\nLANG2=\"de\"\n# CURRENT_LANG=$(setxkbmap -query | tail -n 1 | cut -f6 -d ' ') # OLD LINE\nCURRENT_LANG=$(setxkbmap -query | | grep \"layout\" | cut -f6 -d ' ')\nif [ \"$CURRENT_LANG\" = $LANG1 ]; then\n    setxkbmap $LANG2\nelse\n    setxkbmap $LANG1\nfi\n\nNB: If someone changes the number of spaces in the line \"layout:     us\" then the -f6 option will fail to return \"us\".  That will likely have to be fixed in the future.\nAgain, thank you so much for this fix.  I can work much more efficiently now.\n** Sorry, this was overly wordy\n", "Q: where/how to find the last linux-image patched with apparmor (Kernel needs AppArmor 2.4 compatibility patch.) where/how to find the last linux-image patched with apparmor (Kernel needs AppArmor 2.4 compatibility patch.)\nwithout patvhing myself the kernel?\nthanks\nanswer: \nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/i386/linux-image\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/i386/linux-headers-3.2.0-24\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/i386/linux-image-3.2.0-24-generic-pae/3.2.0-24.39\n\nA: You can see the history of the Precise (3.2) linux kernel at http://kernel.ubuntu.com/git?p=ubuntu/ubuntu-precise.git;a=log.

I want to be able to run both windows and linux. Before I install ubuntu on my laptop, I was wondering if I should partition my drive first, and if so how much room is recommended?\n\nA: \nI am going to teach myself to administer linux. I want to be able to run both windows and linux. Before I install ubuntu on my laptop, I was wondering if I should partition my drive first, and if so how much room is recommended?\n\nYour question as currently asked is impossible to answer in any way other than by guessing at might be \"good\" for you. I can tell you that you can install Ubuntu in as small as a 4.5 GB partition with no swap space, if you want to do that. \nYou provided no information about what type of a computer you are using. Factors such as how much RAM it has and how large the hard drive is would help us to provide better recommendations. \nIt would also help to have more specifics about what you think you might do after you have installed Ubuntu. If all you want to do is learn how to \"administer\" Ubuntu, then perhaps all you need is a 4.5 GB  partition.\n\nIf your computer has hardware support for virtualization then I would recommend that you completely avoid doing a dual-boot. Instead run Ubuntu inside a virtual machine using, for example, VirtualBox, installed under Windows.\nIn my opinion, using Ubuntu installed in a VM provides a better learning environment. \nOne advantage is that while you are still learning how to use Ubuntu you can also work in parallel in the Windows environment you are already familiar with. This actually speeded up the learning process for me. \nAnother advantage is that you don't have to change the partitioning of your drive. A VM uses a virtual hard disk drive (VHDD) which is, essentially, just a very large Windows file. Also, a VHDD can be dynamic meaning the file increases in size only as you use more disk space within the virtual machine. This makes more efficient use of your hard drive.\nBut the main advantage of using a VM such as VirtualBox as a learning aid would have to be snapshots.  A snapshot captures the the current state of a virtual machine and its virtual hard drives. If you make a change that breaks something, you can completely undo it and return to the previous state of your VM simply by restoring the snapshot.\nSnapshots allow you to freely and painlessly experiment. For example, you could \n\n\n*\n\n*Experiment with adding, deleting or modifying system settings. \n\n*Experiment with adding, deleting or modifying users or user privileges.\n\n*Experiment with the partitioning tools.\n\n*Experiment with installing multiple copies of Ubuntu. Or of Windows alongside Ubuntu.\n\n*Experiment with the different install options for Ubuntu.\n\n*and so forth ...\n\n\nMy point is that you can do all of the above without worrying about destroying your install because you can always restore a snapshot you took earlier to completely undo any changes you might have made.\nCompletely overwrote something on your VHDD and made it unbootable? Restore the snapshot and it never happened.\nAnd while you are doing any of the above, you can also do something in Windows. For example, if you start an install of Ubuntu inside a VM, you don't have to twiddle your thumbs while waiting for it to complete. You can do something else in Windows while you VM completes the install.\nBut, unfortunately, using a virtual machine only makes sense if your hardware provides support for it and you have enough RAM to allow you to run two operating systems at the same time. You did not tell us anything about your laptop so there is no way of knowing if this would work for you or not.\n\nA: Yes. You must have to create a separate partition(not a drive) for ubuntu installation. Room size is up to you. If are planning to use it for long time give some 40GB space. When you install ubuntu it will ask for a partition and select the new partition. \nPS: You must not keep any data/files inside that new partition thinking it can be accessed once you are done with ubuntu installation. It will be formatted into a new file system itself. (You may know this but just in case if you don't note this down.)\n\nA: In the most general use case, you would need two different partitions, for installing Ubuntu. A swap partition is very much advised if you need the hibernate feature[You need to enable it manually in Ubuntu 12.04] or if your RAM is below 8GB.\n\n\n*\n\n*The /(root) partition [It contains all the installation files, applications, etc..].\n\n*The swap partition(like Virtual memory in Windows)  \n\n\nAs to how much space is to be allocated for each and as to how to do it, please refer this post with the exact details and screenshots of the steps to be followed-\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/139273/11932\n", "Q: Customizing Ubuntu Mini Remix I've been using Ubuntu for 2 years and now I want to make my own.

Hope this helps some of You, too.\n\n\nA: From Thunderbird v12, it uses libcanberra. And the canberra system only plays the sounds if sound effects are enabled: For default sound and for a custom sound.\nIMHO this behavior is incorrect but this is what Mozilla have decided.\nYou can install libcanberra from the Software Center , or by opening a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and running these commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libcanberra-gstreamer\n\n\nA: I was having a similar issue in Ubuntu 12.04 with Thunderbird 12.0.1. At least in my case, the origin of the problem was two-fold:\n\n\n*\n\n*the option \"Default system sound for new mail\" works only if sound effects are enabled in Ubuntu. If you want Thunderbird to play the default system sound from the Ubuntu theme, but do not want to enable the sound effects, just provide this path /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/message.ogg in the option \"Use the following sound file\".\n\n*whenever you change the path to the sound file, it is crucial to restart Thunderbird, otherwise it plays no sound at all.\nMy suggestion is therefore to select the sound file manually and restart Thunderbird. If it still doesn't work, I think you should file a bug report in launchpad, see here how. This might be a possible duplicate of this very old bug.\nNote that the \"Choose sound\" menu has an hard-coded filter for wav files. In order to select an ogg file you'll have to specify the location explicitly by clicking on the pencil icon and providing the sound file location.\n\n\nA: As for the home folder question, it is a matter of white space. In my situation (plain up to date Ubuntu 12.04, Thunderbird 13.0.1), a notification wav sound does not work if either the path (like My Music), either the file name (like You’ve got mail.wav) contains a space. It does work otherwise (not only from the home folder). Before trying every esound, pulseaudio, libcanberra or whatever, make sure the path and file name contain no space.\n\nA: I had the same problem but got it sorted by doing this: install esound in synaptic then move your sound file you want Thunderbird to play in to your home folder (not in any folder just direct in to home folder) then start Thunderbird and go to preferences and browse for your sound file in your home folder.\nThat worked for me.\nHope that was helpful for you \nCheers Patrick\n\nA: Download and install Thunderbird 14 from here: Install Thunderbird 14\nAll notification sounds work. Not all add ons will be compatible but will be in time.\n\nA: I solved by installing this package: libesd0.\nsudo apt-get install libesd0\n\n\nA: Okay, this issue had me puzzled for months and I'm on Fedora but my post could help someone not break everything for nothing hopefully.\nI realized today that sound notifications in Thunderbird did not work anymore simply because I had disabled sound effects in Pulse... . I'd have never thought the two were related and I had turned it off because I wasn't exactly excited by the sound gallery it offered.\nNow mail notification is back and that's very important for my work. Hope that helps someone out there.\n\nA: I know this is tagged 12.04, but it it seems the most relevant question to post this on: I tried both the system settings and Thunderbird settings in this post, with Thunderbird 68.7 (custom install) on Ubuntu 18.04 and sound worked (when you hit the Play button in Edit/Preferences/General/When new messages arrive, for an ogg sound in /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/) - but with extremely low level; even though Ubuntu settings (gnome-control-center) had Output volume on max:\n\nThis got fixed when I started pavucontrol, and realized Playback/System Sounds was very low, which I then increased:\n\nOnly then I realized, that \"Alert volume\" slider on first screenshot, is linked to the \"System Sounds\" on second screenshot.\nBut anyways, now the new message sound from Thunderbird is audible - though still lower than other system sounds, not sure why.\nEDIT: in about:config of Thunderbird (Edit/Preferences/Advanced/Config Editor.../I accept the risk!) there are also media.default_volume and media.volume_scale, both by default on 1.0 - I set both of these to 3.0, but it seems to have no effect on the new mail sound ...\n", "Q: gThumb Browser and Viewer should have black background, how to do?

In MS office Access for instance there is always a way to import Excel data just right in Access ribben labeled Import External file and by following the wizard view, you can easily link to Excel data.\nBut I don't know whether it is possible in Libreoffice Base to import Calc data. Is there anyway to achieve that? At work most of the time my colleagues sent me files in xlsx so when I want to use them in base I don't know what to do. \nI like base because it can deal with large quantity of data unlike Calc or excel.\n\nA: My problem with the answered above method is that it seems creates a read-only database from the spreadsheet file, so you can't actually edit anything. The same problem occurs with data in text files and system address books. This probably makes the imported data less useful than when it was on the spreadsheet, as then primary keys and stuff can't be added, and the tables can't be edited as the options are greyed out due to it being read-only.\nI eventually found a method here that works nicely - here's a summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new database:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a table in the database with the same fields/columns/whatever as the spreadsheet being imported\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the data in the spreadsheet to be placed in the database - if you include a first line with labels it can be automatically removed - and copy it. The go to the database, right-click on the entry for the table and select 'Paste':\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*A options thing will then appear, and you can use this to import the data into the spreadsheet. You can also select which fields will be copied by pressing 'Next':\n\n\n\n\nThat should be another way you can import data into a database.\n\nA: This is possible quite easily. Just set up a database connection to your spreadsheet file:\n\nAfter clicking Next >>, you will be prompted for the name and path of the spreadsheet file:\n\n\nA: There's a WAY easier way.  Highlight the fields in calc and select them - do not highlight header fields, just highlight the data.  Copy to the clipboard (edit - copy).\nMake a backup of your Base file in case something goes wrong.  Now open your Base file, but, this is important, do not open the table.  Select Tables from the Database area on the left.  Now, just click, once, on the table to which you want to import your data, only click one time to select it but don't open it.  Right click.  Select paste, and a wizard pops up that asks you how to import the data.  Follow those instructions and the data will be imported into your table as specified. In the next screen, the wizard will show you the first row of what is being imported and will show you the fields from the table that each imported column will map to, and there you can make any changes so that the columns go into the proper database fields.\nSo for example, if the database fields are FirstName & Lastname, and the first row of your data is Smith, Tom, the wizard will tell you it's going to map the column containing Smith to FirstName and the column containing Tom to LastName, which is exactly backwards, so swap the field names and press OK.  Your data will be imported.  Double click on the table and there it will be.\n", "Q: Photoshop CS2 under Wine 1.4 Messes up Unity Desktop I'm aware that the general consensus is that Photoshop is at best barely usable under Wine. I'm one of the lucky few that got CS2 (apparently one of the least quirky) running well under Wine 1.4 in Ubuntu 12.04. All the mentioned quirks like the crashes provoked by the text tool are not present. With the -for my practical purposes- unimportant exception of Bridge refusing to start, the rest is working just fine.\nThe only grave quirk it has is that on closure, it messes up completely the Unity desktop, lossing automatically the 3D appearance, leaving me with a D2 desktop, square cornered windows and without the (x)(-)([]) buttons and windows title. This forces me to close the windows by means of Ctrl-Q and eventually a reboot to get back the correct desktop and window appearance. \nIn the likely case there's no solution to this behaviour, is there a command or script I may use to restore the usual desktop? That would allow me to place a launcher to that effect.\nI'll appreciate any comment not in the lines of looking for a Photoshop substitute. I've been through all and they won't let me do in a practical manner what I need.\nMany thanks in advance.\nJorge.\n\n\n\nUpdate 27.05.2012 14:20 CST:\nEliah Kagan and Alvin have helped me to pinpoint the problem to the 3D session. Thus, so far the solution involves logging-out of the 3D session and logging back-in with a 2D session before starting Photoshop; then it exits normally and doesn't disturb the desk.\nOf great help would be a way to switch-off the 3D effects without having to log-out, and then back-on, if it is at all feasible. Of even greater help would be a BASH script to automate this.\n\nUpdate 27.05.2012 19:10 CST:\njasmines' suggestion to do a compiz --replace doesn't terminate correctly, although while the order is still in a loop the desktop appears normal. However, closing the terminal or breaking the loop reverts the session status to a crippled desk, no top panel, no launcher, no window top bar & controls and now; no keyboard.\nThe final output of the compiz --replace where it gets stuck is this:\nWARN  2012-05-27 20:44:32 unity <unknown>:0 Unable to fetch children: No existe la interfaz «org.ayatana.bamf.view» en el objeto en la ruta /org/ayatana/bamf/application62801462\n\nWARN  2012-05-27 20:44:32 unity <unknown>:0 Unable to fetch children: No existe la interfaz «org.ayatana.bamf.view» en el objeto en la ruta /org/ayatana/bamf/application62801462\n\nHopefully somebody can decode this. It's sanskrit to me. \nThe solution to the problem is still at large...\n\nSOLVED!\nSee virpara's answer. I created the script by his suggestion and placed a launcher to it in my desktop. Works like a charm and solves my Photoshop exit bad manners in less than a minute :-) \nAdding 3 screen captures of before, during and after.\n\n\n\nBeautiful. This place is a wealth of knowledge.

(I do not have access to the computer mentioend above at the moment; when I do I will use some of the criteria given there to analyze the problem further.)\n\nA: Was the system upgraded from a previous version to 12.04? If yes, then simply ask each user to re-assign it's wallpaper. Set a dummy one, then again the new one. \nThis question was also posted about this\nEdit:\nLook for Bruno Pereira's answer in this question.\nIt's not the officially accepted question, but the one with 7 upvotes. He explains quite nicely how to set your own default wallpaper in LightDM.\nCheers\n\nA: I found that if my wallpaper was not in the home partition then it would not be used in light GDM, like if had a wallpaper that was from a partition that was mounted using fstab. \n\nA: On a new box I had the same problem with a fresh install and a custom wallpaper that had all the correct permissions all the way up change of directories. I can't explain what was going wrong but what finally fixed the problem was when I set it as the wallpaper using the add (+) button in the Appearance dialog.\n\n", "Q: Which character can work as \"tick\" (US \"check-mark\") in documents under Ubuntu and Windows? I need to use a character for \"tick\" in LibreOffice documents that will display OK in Ubuntu and Windows. Character 252 (or thereabout) in Wingdings works in Windows but obviously this character wouldn't be displayed properly on systems lacking the fontset (eg my Ubuntu system).  \nCan Wingdings be installed in Ubuntu? That would solve my problem of transferring documents between my Windows and Ubuntu systems. \nIs there another way to solve this? eg an anternative font that looks like a \"tick\" and works across setups. I suppose if there is no other way, I could use the square root character, which is in the basic fontset. \n\nA: Unicode has a character for the tick (check-mark) character:\n✓\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick_(check_mark)\nYou can find this character using the search function of the \"Character Map\" application.  But do search for \"check mark\" and not \"tick\".\n\nA: Around here, we'd call that a check-mark. My suggestion would be to either use an image of a check-mark or the built-in check-mark bullet point, if that would work for you.\n\nA: Webdings are available in Ubuntu. In Libre Office use:\nInsert > Special Character > (Font) Webdings > (Select the Special Character you want)\nThe checkmark symbol is also available in this character set.\n\nA: To insert a check mark: In word type “3” without quotes, highlight and right click the 3. Select Character and in the window that opens up, select the font tab and  under Family type “dingbats” without quotes and hit the return key. In spreadsheets highlight all the required cells and right click, select Format Cells, select the font tab and under Family type “dingbats” without quotes and hit the return key. Each time you type 3 in one of these cells a check mark will appear.\n3 and 4 will give check marks, 7 and 8 will give crosses.\nDownload ufonts.com_zap-dingbats-normal.tff from ufonts.com/search/dingbats/11\nTo install fonts in linux:\n Copy .ttf  to usr/share/fonts/truetype then compile fonts: sudo fc-cache -fv\nIn Windows10:\n Right click the file and select install then re-boot.\n", "Q: Force Unity to open any file with any program When you drag a file to the Unity launcher, only the applications that are supposed to open that file will remain active, while all others become deactivated.\nIs it possible to configure Unity to ignore that setting and open the file, no matter what extension the file has, with any of the applications on the launcher?\nI'd be glad to get an unsupported file type from the application when I make a mistake instead of losing a bunch of time configuring what application can open what file (that's because it is no longer possible to add a custom application/path in the Open with... menu)\n\nA: It should still work.

You can verify by:\nls -a ~/\n\nIs this a new install, or did you have files that you need restored? If you did lose some photos, music, etc. here is a link to some more information on recovery: How to recover deleted files?\n\nA: You will lose all use settings and browser profiles, as well as any downloads or files you specifically saved there.

However, I cannot find either 'Lord of Ultima' or 'Bit trip runner', although I see them available in the Ubuntu Software Centre. \nI'd like to install these games via the software centre so it gets added to the download stats for the game developers to see.\nHow come I can't see these in Muon Software Centre?\n\nA: The reason for this is that Muon Software Center hasn't added support for the commercial repositories that Ubuntu Software Center can access.\nDue to the fact that these repositories don't contain things that are freely distributable to anyone they don't use the standard repository format that is supported by all package managers (including Muon.) Instead they have a separate mechanism that allows the contents to be searched before the repositories are added, with a mechanism for adding the repositories and taking payment.\nCurrently Muon Software Center doesn't support this new type of repository and so none of the apps available from these repositories can be accessed using it. At this time you will have to use Ubuntu Software Center to get access to them.\nThanks,\nJames\n\nA: Lord Of Ultima is just  A Web Based Game actually...you can directly install it from chrome store in your browser and then if you badly want a shortcut,chrome/chromium aloows you to do that too..\nYou can find Lord Of Ultima Here in the chrome store\n", "Q: USB Mouse sleeping after 5 seconds when on battery My usb mouse sleeps after 5 seconds of inactivity when running on battery power.\nIt wakes uo again when i press any button on the mouse.

Ubuntu offers a free driver for your graphics card, but free drivers cannot be 100% perfect because it is written by the open source community who don't necessarily have all of the information about the graphics controllers that the manufacturers do.\nSo first go to the Dash (the huge Ubuntu icon on the top-left corner) and search for \"jockey\".  After it finishes searching for drivers, find the graphics card driver(nVIDIA or ATI/AMD) and install it.

I have recently moved from doing web development on a from-home basis (with simple Wordpress edits and such) to more of a full time position.  \nThis means I am now, to a small degree, dealing with server management as well. I know that, for instance, with the bigger packages like PHP, Moodle, Alfresco etc etc, I can check their forums to gauge user acceptance before applying an update. However, I also see alot of package updates for other packages (generally library packages mainly used for dependencies), like libpql or libssl.  \nGoogling these just tends to get me alot of the package list websites that have the package but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of talk about them and their latest updates (at least, not that I am finding). Up until I started this job, I would have just applied them off the bat, with the thought-process being \"If Ubuntu has them on their package list, they've been checked as stable\". A few months of dealing with the bugs that DO make it into releases of larger packages (like Alfresco, Moodle), however, has made me more wary.  \nIs there a good place I can look for information about these packages, can I just assume that \"no news is good news\" for packages I don't see anything about when googling, or perhaps do I just bite the bullet and accept that I can't know for sure, so make sure my backup plan is working (it is)?\n\nA: You bite the bullet and accept that you can't know for sure.  Unless you enable the backports repository, the only updates pushed in stable Ubuntu releases are patches to fix critical bugs and security vulnerabilities, after they have been reviewed and tested in the -testing repository.  Only minimal patches are allowed so they can be reviewed and the chances of breakage that the review process misses are small.\nFor more details, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates\n", "Q: Brightness keys don't work on a Toshiba Satellite L655 I have a laptop toshiba satallite L655  with ATI Radeon HD 5650.\nI have a problem in my super key for the brigthness.\nWhen ever i press FN+f6 or FN+f7 to increase or decrease the light, nothing happens.

So this may not reveal problems between the drive/controller and your motherboard.\n\n*\n\n*The obvious inference is a bad cable, but that isn't supported by the disk-utility graphs; reads should be affected too. Still, swap cables/SATA ports and see if it makes a difference.\n\n\n*Run the long self-test with smartctl -t long ; fastest in captive mode -C (unmount all partitions!), and when done, check status/errors with -l (the test will abort as soon as an error is detected)\n\n\n*If that works out, do you remember anything that could have triggered this problem software-side? Kernel upgrade/downgrade, etc.?\n\n\n*Finally, if all your other disks are fine, this may very well be a bizarre bug with the drive's write-cache controller. Backup data and RMA it as soon as possible.\n(post any questions in comments and I'll update the answer. Good luck!)\n", "Q: Choices of tools for graphical performance indications?

I decided to use my Eee PC 1001HA as a home server. I have it connected through Wi-Fi to the router, running Ubuntu Server 12.04. Everything works fine except this annoying problem:\nwhen I close the lid, the ssh server stops working and, I guess, wlan0 too.\nTried the BIOS and nothing, no option about the lid. My wlan0 is a RaLink RT3090.\nTried ls -lrt /var/log between lid derivatives, but I can't understand those satanic logs. I can share them if needed.\npm-powersave.log seems to be updated between lid movements. So I guess I've to disable this \"powersave\" service. Can I do this? I don't mind if the server runs all day.\nRemember that there is no UI, this is a netbook with a lid and its connected to the ac adapter.\nedit: This is just a workaround but I am able to click the power-button and close the lid quickly. This way the server boots normally and connects to the wireless network automatically. (found here)\n\nA: Everything stops working because...the laptop goes to sleep! (suspend mode).\nTo stop, just disable the ACPI lid-button event.\nEdit /etc/acpi/event/lidbtn and comment out the bottom two lines:\n\n  # /etc/acpi/events/lidbtn\n  # Called when the user closes or opens the lid\n  event=button[ /]lid  # comment this out with a # at the beginning\n  action=/etc/acpi/lid.sh # same here \nReboot, and that should be it.\n\nA: I am using 14.04 LTS with ASUS EEE.\nThe solution by Stephan above didn't work for me.  However, this answer worked.\n\nA: Another approach,\nfor me on Ubuntu Server 20.10, changing logind.conf did not help (although I've also done that, haven't tested this solution without those changes in that file), and the\n\nsudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target\nhybrid-sleep.target\n\n-approach caused systemd to consume 100% of my CPU, but from this manpage\nhttps://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man5/systemd-sleep.conf.5.html\nI managed to get it to work (no reboot or anything) by disabling sleep in it's entirety;\nIn /etc/systemd/sleep.conf add the following lines\nAllowSuspend=no\nAllowHibernation=no\nAllowSuspendThenHibernate=no\nAllowHybridSleep=no\n\nAlthough that might not be an option if you want to be able to suspend it etc. in some other situation, but at least it worked for me.\n\nA: I think setting the SUSPEND_METHODS=\"none\" option in /etc/default/acpi-support, does the same thing\n\nA: Editing the /etc/systemd/logind.conf helped, but not with only adding\nHandleLidSwitch=ignore\n\nI also had to add the lines:\nHandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore\n\nand\nLidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=no\n\n\nA: Turn off laptop screen when closed\nThis works for me on a new install of Ubuntu Server LTS 18.04.1.\nThe answer from @user386160 worked great to prevent my laptop from going to sleep.  But I found out that my monitor was staying on even when the lid was closed (a.k.a. generating unnecessary heat).\nHere's the additional steps I took to turn off the laptop monitor when the screen was closed:\nsudo apt-get install acpi-support vbetool\nsudo echo \"event=button/lid.*\" > /etc/acpi/events/lid-button\nsudo echo \"action=/etc/acpi/lid.sh\" >> /etc/acpi/events/lid-button\nsudo touch /etc/acpi/lid.sh\nsudo chmod +x /etc/acpi/lid.sh\nsudo nano /etc/acpi/lid.sh\n\nThen set the contents of the lid.sh file to the following:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ngrep -q close /proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state\n\nif [ $? = 0 ]; then\n    sleep 0.2 && vbetool dpms off\nfi\n\ngrep -q open /proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state\n\nif [ $? = 0 ]; then\n    vbetool dpms on\nfi\n\n\nA: To disable entering the sleep mode I had to edit the /etc/systemd/logind.conf file and modify the line:\n#HandleLidSwitch=suspend\n\nto\nHandleLidSwitch=ignore\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the file also has this line:\nLidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=no\n\nThen restart the OS via:\nsudo service systemd-logind restart\n\n\nA: just to confirm, 14.04 LTS Server user here on a Dell X100e.\nsudo apt-get install acpi-support\nsudo vi /etc/default/acpi-support # and then set SUSPEND_METHODS=\"none\"\nsudo /etc/init.d/acpid restart\n\nInstantly able to close lid, no issues.\nJust posting to confirm the previous posters' solution as the only fix needed. No need (currently) to do anything else in addition to this.\n\nA: This worked for me - my Ubuntu Server install didn't have /etc/acpi/event/lidbtn either, but I installed the acpi-support package and then it showed up.\nThe package installs a whole bunch of other X11 related packages but doesn't enable graphical mode, don't worry.\nOnce I commented the last two lines as above then my laptop stayed running with the lid closed.\n\nA: Approach that worked for me running Ubuntu Server 22.04 on a MacBook Pro 7,1; edit the login.conf file and utilize setterm cli command. This also helped make sure my screen and logo backlight turned off.\nEdit file: /etc/systemd/logind.conf\nAdjust these two parameters:\nHandleLidSwitch=ignore\nHandleLidSwitchExternalPower=ignore\n\nAlso, in the terminal, type:\nsetterm --blank 1 --powerdown 2\n", "Q: Why won't my computer connect to wireless?

I want to use a good search engine, not the piece of garbage that is OpenDNS Guide! Thanks for your help!\nEDIT:\nOkay, I've found a workaround. I installed the the add-on InstantFox, which lets you set search keywords. I know that this feature is already built into Firefox, but I was able to use InstantFox's \"Standard Search Without Shortcuts\" option and set a standard search URL. Everything works fine now. Not the most satisfactory fix, but at least it works.\n\nA: The way this is working is that rather than sending askubuntu.com to opendns to convert the name to an IP address, you are sending simply askubuntu. instead. Of course there is no askubuntu., and if their DNS server was doing what it should, it should send an error code back to you. Instead, whenever there is no domain name matching what your computers send, it is returning the IP address of its own search service. (67.215.65.132) is what I just received. Ads there are probably how they pay for the service they offer.\nThere are ways to block this address, but there's no reason to believe they won't just change it. And, if you did block it, you would have your browser just spin and spin waiting for the blocked site to get back to you.\nYour browser won't and can't know the difference.\nI'd suggest instead that you use the DNS server provided by your ISP. You are paying for it so that's probably a reasonable thing to do.\nAnother approach is to use google's public DNS servers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. I've heard they consider DNS server problems to be a threat to their business so they decided to provide their own DNS service as a public service. I suppose the question is whether you trust them. Their privacy web page indicates they are sensitive to privacy issues, but you should decide whether their policies are adequate for you, and whether you believe that they will adhere to them. Here's the page.\nHere's an article with a list of public DNS services. I personally use my ISP's with one of google's as a backup. I'd research level 3 if I didn't want to use my own ISP's, opendns', or google's since their business is bandwidth rather than ads or content.\nIf you are OK with your ISP's service but it isn't completely reliable, maybe you could list it first and opendns or another open service listed second. That way the public service only get's your lookups (after a couple second delay) when your ISP's server is down.\n", "Q: Error 1962: no operating system found after installing 12.04 (Lenovo ThinkCentre) I just installed a fresh copy of Ubuntu 12.04 on a new Lenovo ThinkCenter from a USB drive. When I restarted after installation, the boot sequence didn't find the OS. Instead I got the no operating system found error. When I started Ubuntu from the USB, I could see the HDD and that it had all the installed files. I just couldn't boot into it. It appeared that GRUB was not at the right place or that there was something wrong with the UEFI and GRUB. What is the simplest way to fix these errors?\n\nA: Ok...this took a lot longer than it should. But here it goes:\nInstalling 12.04 on a 64 bit system that supports UEFI booting like the thinkcentere will create three partitions on the system: a FAT partition for EFI, the ext4 partition for ubuntu and some swap. However, restarting the machine, I was not able to boot at all. Initially, the Intel Boot agent would kick in and try to boot from the network. Even if you turn that off, as indicated later, it still doesn't boot. It says no operating system found.\nNow here are the things I tried that didn't work for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the SATA controller type to IDE Using a boot repair disk (it\ndoesn't know how to handle EFI with GPT partitioning) \n\n*Changing the order of the boot sequence to put HDD first\n\n*Changing the boot mode from UEFI, to Legacy or to Auto\n\n*Recompiling GRUB2 and putting it in the UEFI paritition, as indicated here:https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting\n\n\nThe first good direction I got was from this thread:http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1896052  People were having problems with earlier versions of Ubuntu. One of the suggested solutions is to install 10.04 first, and update from there.\nWhat this really does is forget UEFI altogether, and create just two partions..the ext4 for ubuntu 10.04 and swap. You could then upgrade to ubuntu, which keeps the same partitioning. A couple things to note...mind your architectures, since this particular machines support 64 bit or 32 bit, so the 10.04 you install first should have the architecture you intend to keep. Also, your network card will likely not work on the 10.04 kernel, so you will have to upgrade from the cd by installing the alternate iso. Follow these instructions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseUpgrades#Upgrading_Using_the_Alternate_CD.2BAC8-DVD . \nWhat I did instead was, First installed 10.04, then install ubuntu 12.04 again, but go to 'do something else' on the partitioning page...and i simply chose to reformat the main ubuntu parition and leave the swap as is (mind you, after 10.04 you probably have only those two partions on the HDD you installed the ubuntu on). [in retrospect, I could just have created those partions without installing 10.04, it seems]\nOnce installation is done,  I restarted, but was greeted with an error \"invalid arch independent ELF magic\". Looking this up indicated that grub was probably from a previous version of ubuntu,and needs to be installed again. I had to boot from the liveCD/USB again, and reinstall grub2 (you can follow these steps:https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#Reinstall_from_the_LiveCD)\nAlright, now restart again. It should boot, but I got some errors at the begining which said \"no suitable mode found\" and \"no graphics mode found\". Apparently, this is something simple that has to do with fonts. Found this bug report https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/699802 and then used the workaround on comment #24 and viola. Now the system boots into 12.04 with no errors...it is using legacy booting...but it working for now at least.\nI believe this can be fixed in the installation process of 12.04, but things are this way for now.\n\nA: I had the same problem installing Linux Mint 17.1 (Ubuntu 14.04 base) on a Lenovo H430. I'm not sure why I didn't have any issues installing Linux Mint 15 on the same box a year-and-a-half ago, but I probably spent 10 hours trying to get Mint 17.1 to work. I tried ARR's own fix above, I followed steps outlined on several other web pages, I tried Boot-Repair. In the end, the ease of the fix was inversely proportional to the time I spent banging my head.\nAll I needed to do was to enable the Lenovo H430 CSM option (Compatibility Support Module) in the BIOS/UEFI (F1 on power up to enter UEFI). The other settings fell into place automatically. Then I rebooted and was actually a bit angry that it worked given the time I had invested on more complicated attempts at solving the problem. In the Startup tab of the UEFI my settings were\n\n\n*\n\n*CSM [Enabled]  \n\n*Boot Mode [Auto]  \n\n*Boot Priority [Legacy first]  \n\n*Quick Boot [Disabled or Enabled, either will work]  \n\n*Rapid Boot [Disabled]\n\n*Boot Up Num-Lock Status [On] (shouldn't matter but included for completeness)  \n\n*Keyboardless Operation [Enabled] (shouldn't matter but included for completeness)\n\n\nI had made changes to Boot Mode and Boot Priority and Quick Boot several times in my attempts to get the new Linux install to boot. But without enabling CSM, nothing worked. If you have a Lenovo H430 and are having trouble installing Ubuntu or any other Linux, I would definitely recommend trying this setting. If you have a different computer but have a CSM option, this might work for you as well.\n\nA: You need a boot loader in the MBR in order to boot from the hard disk.  The MBR is not in a partition of the disk, it's at the beginning in a special place.  So when the installer asked you where to put GRUB, if you told it the same partition as Ubuntu, it won't be found.\nProbably the easiest way to fix it is to use the GRUB Boot Repair Disk.  My experience is that this will usually fix the problem automatically.  I'd give it a try before trying anything complicated, unless you really want to learn a lot, and have a lot of patience or troubleshooting abilities.\n\nA: I had the same issue and the following worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run ubuntu from installation disk\n\n*install and run boot-repair (you need internet access)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\n\n*just choose the \"Recommended Repair\"\n\n*boot from harddisk installation\n\n*repeat steps 1-3\n\n*restart. \n\n\nit should work now.\n\nA: I would suggest that you boot into the BIOS (usually it's F1 IRCC on ThinkCentes) and go to the SATA option and change it from AHCI to either IDE or Compatibility mode. I work at a place that has all ThinkCentres so if you're unable to find that option to configure the BIOS. Make a comment on the Model-Type (ie. 4329-ACU) and I'll check to see if we have that same model  tomorrow and will edit this to include exact steps. I have had the same exact problem when taking a machine right out of the box and installing Ubuntu (regardless of release).\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I had this same issue on a Lenovo ThinkCentre, but I needed to run in AHCI mode. \nTo fix the boot up error 1962, I went into the BIOS setup (held down F1 after starting), navigated to STARTUP and changed the BOOT MODE to UEFI. Now, every time I boot, it immediately boots into Windows 7 without errors. \nI believe my MBR became corrupted (or lost entirely), but this method worked fine after restoring a backup image of the hard drive (which obviously wasn't 100% complete).\n\nA: I just ran into the same problem installing 12.04.1 LTS on a Lenovo H430 machine.\nSo I installed it again using the above answers as clues and the statement: \"[in retrospect, I could just have created those partions without installing 10.04, it seems]\" in particular.\nSo rather than installing 10.04 first, I just deleted the existing partitions using manual partitioning in the installer first.\nAnd then used a guided install to recreate the new partitions. Then when the install started it asked me if I wanted to create a new Master Boot Record and I said yes and now it boots into Ubuntu just fine.\n\nA: I ran into that issue, and currently I'm (again). Error 1962.\nNow, I'm not using ubuntu (is my mom's pc), but since the issue is about the hardware, the OS doesn't make any difference.\nWe bought the E1 thinkcentre on Jan/2013, 4 days after purchased the pc crashed. Lenovo exchange the HDD then but with w7 instead w8. A faulty lenovo technician tried install w8 but he failed and then for some reason the MOBO was damaged. Lenovo took the PC and 1 month and half later we got the PC back home with a new HDD and a new MOBO (according Lenovo). I powered up the pc and 4 hours later, guess what: 1962 again.\nUsing the logic, I thought, new HDD, new MOBO, should be the cable... or connectors, or definitely the MOBO.\nUsing the logic, I thought, new hdd, new mobo, should be the cable. I found something that confirms this suspects:\nERROR CODE 1962 - NO OPERATING SYSTEM FOUND - Lenovo Community\nThe cable Lenovo use is too tight and faulty. So it's a lenovo issue. They need find a solution exchanging the tipe of cable. Unfortunately for us under warranty we can't change the core components as we wish, that is a problem. We'll need stand.\n\nA: On my machine, boot-repair experienced an error! Fortunately, I was able to successfully boot Ubuntu 14.04 on my Lenovo ThinkCentre by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting boot mode to legacy in BIOS.\n\n*Booting Ubuntu LiveCD.\n\n*Using gPartEd to delete all partitions.\n\n*Using the Ubuntu installer, selecting the \"Replace current operating system\" option.\n\n\nA: I had this problem with an ECS A75 board which BIOS was based on Lenovo. Apparently, most of Lenovo BIOS have this little issue that makes the UEFI boot always seek for the boot folders with same structure as in Windows 8.\nI lost 3 days trying to figure out how to make Red Hat 6.5 boot properly after installation. Ok, RHEL have outdated Kernel and Ubuntu 13 already changed this, but in case someone still needs this solution, here goes how i solved it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Live Ubuntu and then mount the boot partition; \n\n*Inside this partition there is one only folder, named [EFI]. Inside [EFI] folder, a subfolder named [REDHAT], containing the files [grub.conf] and [grub.efi]. Probably in Ubuntu this subfolder is named [UBUNTU];\n\n*On [EFI] folder you should duplicate the subfolder, whatever it is, and then rename this copy as [BOOT];\n\n*Now, inside the newly renamed [BOOT] folder you should rename the files to [Bootx64.conf] and [Bootx64.efi];\n\n*Unmount the partition and try to boot to your system now.\n\n\nLet us know if this works for your problem.\n", "Q: System Reports only 4 GB or RAM To make a long story short, Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit is only detecting 4 GB of RAM even though 8 GB are installed. Here's what I've done so far to rectify the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replaced both RAM sticks, issue persisted.\n\n*Replaced motherboard, issue persisted.\n\n*Booted from Live CD to see if it was a software issue, persisted.\n\n*BIOS detects 8 GB of memory properly but shows it as being in \"single channel mode\". \n\n\nWhen I first put together this system (only a mere 3 weeks ago), it was detecting the proper amount of RAM just fine. Shortly thereafter, I installed a new power supply in the machine (as the original one I had ordered ended up being too small for my the enclosure I have). It seems to me that the problem started after I installed the new power supply. \nI've replaced every component in the system since then troubleshooting, but not the power supply. Could this in some way be the problem? If there's some sort of power flow problem, would it cause memory to run in Single Channel Mode? Everything else appears to be working fine... hard drive, blu-ray drive, only thing is that within System Information, I see that the reported CPU speed sometimes jumps between 2700 MHz and 800 MHz. Is that normal for a quad-core system under Ubuntu 12.04?\nThank you. \n    output of uname -m:\n    x86_64\n\n    output of free -m:\n\n\n                 total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\n    Mem:          3680       3072        608          0        150       1755\n    -/+ buffers/cache:       1166       2513\n    Swap:         7912          0       7912\n\n\n\n    `*-firmware              \n       description: BIOS\n       vendor: American Megatrends Inc.\n       physical id: 0\n       version: P1.50\n       date: 02/09/2012\n       size: 64KiB\n       capacity: 4032KiB\n       capabilities: pci upgrade shadowing cdboot bootselect socketedrom edd int13floppy1200 int13floppy720 int13floppy2880 int5printscreen int9keyboard int14serial int17printer acpi usb biosbootspecification\n    *-memory\n       description: System Memory\n       physical id: 6\n       slot: System board or motherboard\n       size: 8GiB\n     *-bank:0\n          description: DIMM DDR3 Synchronous 1333 MHz (0.8 ns)\n          product: 1333EL Series\n          vendor: Undefined\n          physical id: 0\n          serial: 00000000\n          slot: A1_DIMM0\n          size: 4GiB\n          width: 64 bits\n          clock: 1333MHz (0.8ns)\n     *-bank:1\n          description: DIMM DDR3 Synchronous 1333 MHz (0.8 ns)\n          product: Array1_PartNumber1\n          vendor: A1_Manufacturer1\n          physical id: 1\n          serial: A1_SerNum1\n          slot: A1_DIMM1\n          size: 4GiB\n          width: 64 bits\n          clock: 1333MHz (0.8ns)\n  *-cache:0\n       description: L1 cache\n       physical id: d\n       slot: L1 CACHE\n       size: 512KiB\n       capacity: 512KiB\n       clock: 1GHz (1.0ns)\n       capabilities: pipeline-burst internal write-back unified\n  *-cache:1\n       description: L2 cache\n       physical id: e\n       slot: L2 CACHE\n       size: 4MiB\n       capacity: 4MiB\n       clock: 1GHz (1.0ns)\n       capabilities: pipeline-burst internal write-back unified\n\nHere's the BIOS e820 information:\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000] BIOS-provided physical RAM map:\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009ec00 (usable)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 000000000009ec00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000000e0000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 00000000bf77c000 (usable)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000bf77c000 - 00000000bf7c5000 (ACPI NVS)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000bf7c5000 - 00000000bf7cd000 (ACPI data)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000bf7cd000 - 00000000bf7d1000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000bf7d1000 - 00000000bf7d6000 (ACPI NVS)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000bf7d6000 - 00000000bfa43000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000bfa43000 - 00000000bfa4a000 (ACPI NVS)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000bfa4a000 - 00000000bfa72000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000bfa72000 - 00000000bfc75000 (ACPI NVS)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000bfc75000 - 00000000bff00000 (usable)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000e0000000 - 00000000f0000000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000fec00000 - 00000000fec01000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000fec10000 - 00000000fec11000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000fed00000 - 00000000fed01000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000fed61000 - 00000000fed71000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000fed80000 - 00000000fed90000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 00000000ff000000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000]  BIOS-e820: 0000000100001000 - 000000012f000000 (usable)\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000] NX (Execute Disable) protection: active\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000] DMI 2.7 present.\nMay 25 04:48:08 Arcturus kernel: [    0.000000] DMI: To Be Filled By O.E.M.

I see Martin Pitt was involved from Canonical and I trust him. Sorting this sort of thing out is often a matter of trust unless you are an expert. I'm not.\nIt is said to be hardware specific, in terms of what the hard drive is doing to conserve power and temperature, so if you want to double check your hardware to see if it is doing excessive load cycles, why not? \nChecking Hard Drive S.M.A.R.T Statistics\n\n\n*\n\n*Start a terminal\n\n*sudo apt-get install smartmontools\n\n*sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda  # where /dev/sda should be replaced by\nthe name of your disk.\n\n*Look at the statistics for Load_Cycle_Count, write it down, and then\ncheck it again after 24 hours. \n\n\nYour laptop or disk manufacturer may have information about what is reasonable and what is excessive. I believe I saw that people have developed work arounds for use if they are concerned.\nPersonally, I've had my laptop about 2 1/2 years ago and have Ubuntu running on it 24/365 (I don't have to run Itunes anymore so I don't have to run Windows anymore). I do keep it plugged in most of the time so it's probably not doing really aggressive power saving, but I've never checked. It looks like it has done a load about every 20 minutes for the life of the hard drive (Looking at Power_On_Hours).\nHard drives don't last forever, due to this sort of thing, normal wear, temperature, etc. So it is always best to make regular backups, whether there's been anything to this sort of thing or not.\n", "Q: Logitech Wireless Keyboard & mouse not working after upgrade to 12.04? I upgraded my Dell Dimension 9200C to 12.04 Precise Pangolin with no issues, I ran it fine for a night but when I went back in a couple days later my Logitech Wireless Keyboard K350 and M510 mouse weren't active when booted.  I can boot into an older version from the main the boot screen the mouse and keyboard work, but the network stack is gone.  It says the networking manager on this version is not compatible.  I'm scratching my head, it isn't the mouse and keyboard, they work fine on my dual boot, and they load fine in Knoppix.  They did work fine on 12.04 for 1 night.  Open to suggestions before I re-install completely.\n\nA: I had the same problem; still do. But my solution now (after other failed ones) is to de-port and then re-port the two USB receivers after the initial daily boot up; then both the wireless mouse and keyboard work fine. A very minor nuisance at worst.\nHope this is helpful to someone.\n\nA: I do have similar problems. It works for a couple of minutes and then fails in most cases no matter  what.

I decided to switch to Ubuntu, and I tried installing it the same way I installed Mint.\nI put Ubuntu on a USB drive, booted with usb, installed from Ubuntu, clicked on Something Else (other then over windows), and picked the partition I made for Mint. I formatted it and used the ext4 filesystem and no swap space, the installation went just fine. At the end it told me to restart and when I did, not only did my Ubuntu Partition go missing, so did my D:\\ Drive which had all of my steam games, some school files, and my System Image folder (unfortunately). This is my partitions viewed from Windows 7\nWhat are my options\nedit: Im willing to reset my laptop to factory if I have to, to fix it\nedit2: I have an Asus K53-SV Laptop\nedit3: I can see my drives again in gparted but how can I fix grub so I can run ubuntu\nedit4: Grub doesn't seem to be installed when I look for it in the ubuntu software centre (keep in mind im a brand new linux user)\n\nA: Wait! Don't reformat yet...\nWhat probably happened is that Windows cannot see the ext4 partitions. Boot with your Ubuntu live cd and use Gparted. It should see the partitions. Use it to fix the Grub.\nLet me know if it works. I'm writing like a bat-out-of-hell to keep you from formatting!\n", "Q: Can I dual boot 12.04 with Vista? Recently I've grown an interest about Ubuntu and all its new characteristics, but one thing that concerns me is that in windows vista I currently run my itunes library, and programs such as Microsoft Office, and if I installed Ubuntu I would lose these files.\nIs it possible to install Ubuntu 12.04 without uninstalling Windows vista, and run the both OS's in the same computer?\n\nA: You can dual boot using Wubi Installer.\nHere, go to this website and click \"Start Download\":\n - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\nWhen you are finished downloading, click on the Ubuntu icon. It should install like a normal application. When it's finished reboot and let it prepare Ubuntu, then you can dual boot Ubuntu and Window. \nIf you do not like it, you can always boot back to Windows and uninstall it like a normal application. \n(I recommend making a backup of you files first, in case something goes wrong.(which does not happen often))\n(Treat it like a program that lets you dual boot)\n\nA: Guillermo, the simple answer is YES!\nThere is a bit of things you should do for an optimal dual-boot install tho.\n\n\n*\n\n*Highly recommended is first to make a backup of your whole drive or at least all your documents.\n\n*Then, for safety's sake, I've always partitioned my HD (assuming there's only one) to isolate the operating system (Vista in your case) from the data. The best tool to do that is GParted which is included in the Ubuntu Live CD.\n\n*The time and $ invested in a Live USB memory instead of a CD is worth every minute and penny. Follow the instructions given in the download page. A 4Gb stick is more than enough.\n\n*Last but not least make your Ubuntu partition large enough for growth, I've soon discovered that 30Gb are miserly and 50 barely sufficient. If your disk allows go for 100. When installing Ubuntu, always allow a swap partition twice the size as your RAM. You will eventually need it.\n\n*If you are installing in a Laptop with just one HD, let the auto-installer handle the details. It's quite straightforward really. Don't forget to make your data partition and external backup if at all possible.\nGood luck. Unjoy Ubuntu; 12.04 is terrific!\n\nA: Yes, \nWhen you boot off of the ubuntu live cd to install ubuntu choose \"install side by side with windows vista\" \n\nA: You can also try Ubuntu by booting from the Ubuntu Live CD and give it a test drive. It won't mess with your hard disk unless you tell it to install Ubuntu.\nSo you see from this and the other answers that there are several choices to get your feet wet with Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How can I get the specific colors that are being used in my vim ruby plugin / theme? I looking for the specific hex colors that are being used in my color scheme when I'm editing ruby files with vim. How would I find such information?\n\nA: If you have a GUI, you could use gpick:\n sudo apt-get install gpick\n\nThe colors themselves are reliant on what terminal you use. They are all the named colors, i.e. orange, blue, etc. The specific hex codes for these are very reliant on how your terminal interprets them (at least from my experience). The different color themes are stored here:\n /usr/share/vim/vim73/colors\n\n", "Q: Why does Upstart need `setgid` when I have `setuid` and the user is a member of the group? I'm attempting to configure Upstart to run a small utility that needs to access a tty as a system-wide daemon. When run from the command-line, the utility remains in the foreground and doesn't exit until a Ctrl+C; I've therefore omitted the expect stanza and Upstart is correctly tracking the PID. I've also created an unprivileged account for the daemon using adduser --system --no-create-home --disabled-login avrlirc.\nOn my system, the tty the utility needs to access is installed as:\ncrw-rw----   1 root dialout 166,   0 May 24 19:25 ttyACM0\n\nSo I added the user avrlirc (created above) to the dialout group. When I run the utility as avrlirc everything works as expected. I added the stanza setuid avrlirc to the Upstart configuration file, and the job fails with \"can't open tty\".\nIf I omit the setuid stanza, it works (so it's likely a permissions thing). If I add the setgid dialout stanza alongside the setuid, it also works.\nSo, why do I need setgid when I already have setuid and the user is a member of the appropriate group—why isn't that enough?\nFor reference, the Upstart job config file is:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\nconsole log\nsetuid avrlirc\nsetgid dialout\nexec /usr/local/bin/avrlirc2udp -f -H -h <IP_ADDRESS> -t /dev/ttyACM0\n\nWhere <IP_ADDRESS> is the IPv4 address of the local box and within 192.168.0.0/16.\n\nA: setuid does not set supplementary groups, only primary group. See Upstart bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/upstart/+bug/812870 .\nTo verify the case, you can check grep Gid /proc/YOURPID/status vs id YOURUSER.\n", "Q: Jupiter applet default setting I would like to start Jupiter in Power saving mode but it always start in Max performance mode.

I have seen some scripts starting with #!/bin/sh or #!/bin/bash. Is there any difference between them?\n\nA: bash and sh are two different shells. Basically bash is sh, with more features and better syntax. Most commands work the same, but they are different.  \nHaving said that, you should realize /bin/sh on most systems will be a symbolic link and will not invoke sh.  In Ubuntu /bin/sh used to link to bash, typical behavior on Linux distributions, but now has changed to linking to another shell called dash.  I would use bash, as that is pretty much the standard (or at least most common, from my experience).  In fact, problems arise when a bash script will use #!/bin/sh because the script-maker assumes the link is to bash when it doesn't have to be.\nFor more info, http://man.cx/sh, http://man.cx/bash.\n\nA: In addition to the previous answers, even if /bin/sh is a symbolic link to /bin/bash, #!/bin/sh is not totally equivalent to #!/bin/bash.\nFrom the bash(1) man page :\n\n\"If  bash is invoked with the name sh, it tries to mimic the startup\n  behavior of historical versions of sh as closely as possible, while\n  conforming to the POSIX standard as well.\"\n\nFor example the bash specific syntax :\n exec  > >(tee logfile.txt)\n\ngives an error in a shell beginning with #!/bin/sh, even with the sh->bash symbolic link in place.\n\nA: GNU Bash: #!/bin/bash;\nPOSIX shell: #!/bin/sh.\n\nA: On Linux and other Unix-like systems you have a choice of multiple shells.\nThe shell is responsible not only for drawing your little prompt, but interpreting your commands, especially if you put in complicated logic like pipes, conditionals and so on.\nbash is the most common shell used as a default shell for users of Linux systems.  It is a spiritual descendent of other shells used throughout Unix history.  Its name, bash is an abbreviation of Bourne-Again Shell, an homage to the Bourne shell it was designed to replace, though it also incorporates features from the C Shell and the Korn Shell.\nIt's run, these days, from /bin/bash - any system with bash will have it accessible here.\nIt's not just users that use shells, though.  Scripts (shell scripts) need shells to interpret them.  When you run a shell script, your system needs to start up a shell process to execute your script.\nThe problem is, different shells have tiny little inconsistencies between them, and when it comes to running scripts, these can be a real problem.  bash has quite a lot of scripting features that are unique only to bash, and not to other shells.  This is fine, if you're always going to use bash to run those scripts.  Other shells may try to either emulate bash, or adhere to the POSIX standard, which bash supports pretty well (though adds its own extensions to).\nIt's possible to specify at the top of a shell script which shell it should be run with using a shebang.  A script may specify #!/bin/bash on the first line, meaning that the script should always be run with bash, rather than another shell.\n/bin/sh is an executable representing the system shell.  Actually, it is usually implemented as a symbolic link pointing to the executable for whichever shell is the system shell.  The system shell is kind of the default shell that system scripts should use.  In Linux distributions, for a long time this was usually a symbolic link to bash, so much so that it has become somewhat of a convention to always link /bin/sh to bash or a bash-compatible shell.  However, in the last couple of years Debian (and Ubuntu) decided to switch the system shell from bash to dash - a similar shell - breaking with a long tradition in Linux (well, GNU) of using bash for /bin/sh.  Dash is seen as a lighter, and much faster, shell which can be beneficial to boot speed (and other things that require a lot of shell scripts, like package installation scripts).\nDash is fairly well compatible with bash, being based on the same POSIX standard.  However, it doesn't implement the bash-specific extensions.  There are scripts in existence that use #!/bin/sh (the system shell) as their shebang, but which require bash-specific extensions.  This is currently considered a bug that should be fixed by Debian and Ubuntu, who require /bin/sh to be able to work when pointed to dash.\nEven though Ubuntu's system shell is pointing to dash, your login shell as a user continues to be bash at this time.  That is, when you log in to a terminal emulator anywhere in Linux, your login shell will be bash.  Speed of operation is not so much a problem when the shell is used interactively, and users are familiar with bash (and may have bash-specific customisations in their home directory).\nWhat you should use when writing scripts\nIf your script requires features only supported by bash, use #!/bin/bash.\nBut if at all possible, it would be good to make sure your script is POSIX-compatible, and use #!/bin/sh, which should always, quite reliably, point to the preferred POSIX-compatible system shell in any installation.\n", "Q: Connecting to Ubuntu box I am trying to remote desktop from one Ubuntu machine to another. I can ssh from client to server successfully. On the server machine I set up everything that is mentioned in the guides (Remote Desktop Preferences), but every time I am trying to remote desktop to server from client I get error \"Unable to connect\". Do I need to set anything up on the server besides what I already did? Can I see somewhere why I couldn't connect?\n\nA: In Dash, find or search for Desktop Sharing, configure that and you can then graphically control another machine. This sets up a VNC connection that you can use. If there is no one on the other end when connecting to a machine, make sure that you require a password and disable \"You must confirm each access to this machine\"\n", "Q: How do i install Broadcom wireless driver after compile a custom kernel? i have compiled a custom kernel(ck-patchs,ubuntu-patchs) for my netbook, everything workis good, but not wireless, i can't install \"Wireless Broadcom STA driver\" i got this message :\nDesculpe, a instalação deste driver falhou.\nPor favor, dê uma olhada no arquivo de log para obter detalhes: /var/log/jockey.log\n\nThat is saying to i take a look on jockey.log because can't install the driver\nso jockey.log :\nhttp://pastebin.com/PreqBcUs\n\nA: I think \"ndiswrapper\" application can help you more.

Should I better use Ubuntu One to sync music, pictures and use something else for my ImportantFiles?\nAny tips about correct usage of Ubuntu One? Any tips about my scenario and my goal?\n\nA: If you don't want to treat the cloud version of these files as primary, one option would be to store them in an unsynchronised location and regularly copy them over to a synchronised location.  That way changes made from your phone would only affect the synchronised copy and not the original, and if something goes wrong with the originals you should have your last backup in the cloud.\nYou could either handle the copying manually, or perhaps set up a cron job to do the copying for you.\n\nA: I'd recommend Git in your case. Since your files are important, you may also want them be version controlled.\nIf your files are not secret and very small, you may push them to github, it's free.\nIf your files are secret or very big, you may need a personal git server.

I can't speak to the first, but I can answer the second.\nThe second is linking to bug #981261, which you can look up in Launchpad.  Here's a direct link:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/981261\nThat is marked as a duplicate of bug #974830, which is here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/974830\nThat bug is marked Fix Committed for Precise, which means the issue has been sorted out and a fix is available but it has not yet been rolled out to precise-updates.\nThe issue is a GPU hang in the kernel for Sandybridge which can be worked around by disabling Framebuffer Compression.  It appears that the freeze can be triggered when using Java apps, among other ways.\nSo, you can either bide your time and wait for the next kernel update (3.2.0-26.41), which should include this fix, or work around it manually by adding this parameter to your kernel command line in grub (e.g. add it to /etc/defaults/grub):\ni915.i915_enable_fbc=0\n\nOr, you can enable -proposed and install the pre-release kernel.

I had checked if the battery indicator was problematic but it turned out it wasn't. I drained the battery to it's least possible value and that came to around 1 hr 40 minutes. In fact, I've the same problem with Debian and Xubuntu as well. I would like to get some proper solution for this.\nFYI: I've been having this problem since Ubuntu 11.04 but I'm not able to solve this in spite of trying various fixes like reducing brightness, Removing startup apps, Updating kernel and what not?. I'm a big fan of Ubuntu but this problem is stopping me from using Ubuntu and I'm using Win7 for 90% of the time.\n\nA: I think battery management on Ubuntu is just fine. To improve it, however, you can install Jupiter. According to WebUpd8.Org,\n\nJupiter is an appindicator (it now uses Python instead of Mono) designed to improve laptops / netbooks battery life. It can be used to switch between maximum, high performance and power saving modes, change the screen resolution and orientation, enable or disable bluetooth, touchpad, WiFi (if available) and so on. If you own an Asus EeePC netbook, there's also a separate package that adds support for Asus Super Hybrid Engine (SHE) as well as some other EeePC tweaks.\n\nTo install Jupiter, enter the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install jupiter\n\nSource\nIs Ubuntu Battery Management Better Than Windows?\nI got same model but i7 ...this is awsome tool ..solved the problem \n\nA: I found this very helpful and my problem is solved (for Dell Inspiron N511o):\n\n\n*\n\n*http://itbeginner.hubpages.com/hub/recovering-laptop-battery-home-solution\n\nA: This happens mainly because of the NVIDIA GPU.

The Asus site says that the maximum RAM is 8 GB, but Intel's says my CPU supports 16 GB. What is the maximum RAM I can use on this system under Ubuntu?\n\nA: I just bought an extra 8GB to pop in my U31SD, for 12GB total. Despite the Asus spec page saying 8GB is the limit, this Works fine. Passed memtest86 and is visible to 64bit Ubuntu.\nI have the latest bios update installed, not sure if that makes any difference.\nFYI, output of sudo dmidecode -t 16 indicates Maximum Capacity: 16 GB.\n\nA: For 32 bit the theoretical limit is 2^32 = 4096 MB, but from Ubuntu 12.04 on the PAE (Physical Address Extension) is turned on by default with a limit of 2^36 = 64 GB.\nFor 64 bit it should be 2^64 = 16 777 216 TB (yes that's Terabyte) theroretically. In reality the amount of RAM is limited to 2^48 aka 256 TB of RAM.\nSince the theoretical limits can't really be reached in a normal laptop the actual limitation is the amount memory slots (normally 1-2) in your notebook and the support by the chipset. 8-16 GB is realistic here if you're willing to pay serious money for 8 GB modules.\n\nA: The limit is actually between your hardware (Motherboard memory support and amount of slots in it) and the version of Ubuntu (32 Bit, 32 Bit + PAE, x32ABI, 64 Bit)\nIf you have a motherboard that supports a maximum of 4GB, it does not matter if you use 32 Bit, 32 Bit PAE or 64 Bit since you will have a hardware limit of 4GB.\nBut if you buy a motherboard that supports a higher amount of memory, you can play around with the versions of Ubuntu, which have the following maximum supported memory:\nUbuntu 32 Bit - 4GB RAM\nUbuntu 32 Bit + PAE (Physical Address Extension) - 64GB RAM  \nUbuntu x32ABI - 4GB RAM (This is for 32 Bit architecture modified with 64 Bit enhancements running on 64 Bit hardware. It is not yet available.)  \nUbuntu 64 Bit - A LOT! (Actually 2^64) but because of hardware limits and real world computers the limit is around 1TB ( 1024GB RAM)\nSo the question about memory limit should be used when you are using more than 4GB of RAM. In this case you would need, either 32 Bit PAE or 64 BIT which support really big memory sizes.\nAlso note that if you have for example 4GB right now, and you buy 16GB of ram, there is no need to reinstall Ubuntu or do any changes. Just change the memories and Ubuntu should read and work with them out of the box. No configuration necessary. If you have 32 Bit with 4 GB RAM and you install 16GB or RAM, Ubuntu will automatically change from 32 Bit to 32 Bit PAE. I can vouch for this since I moved from 4GB to 16 GB in the beginning of this year.\nHere is a link to a very good explanation for Ubuntu about memory in 32/64: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/32bit_and_64bit#Memory\nUPDATE - Forgot to add that some motherboards have BIOS updates that enable, correct or enhance the maximum memory supported. For example, some Intel motherboards in the past had problems working with the maximum they supported. A BIOS update fixed this. Other motherboards had support for 4GB because of a BIOS problem, after upgrading they had support for more than 4GB.\nAlso comparing the Maximum supported memory for the CPU and the Motherboard, the Maximum you can have is the Minimum of any of them. So for example:\nCASE 1\nCPU Maximum Supported Memory - 16GB\nMotherboard Maximum Supported Memory - 8GB\nYour Maximum Supported Memory - 8GB (Because is the lowest value between the CPU and Motherboard)\nCASE 2\nCPU Maximum Supported Memory - 16GB\nMotherboard Maximum Supported Memory - 32GB\nYour Maximum Supported Memory - 16GB (Because is the lowest value between the CPU and Motherboard)\nCASE 3\nCPU Maximum Supported Memory - 16GB\nMotherboard Maximum Supported Memory - 64GB\nYour Maximum Supported Memory - 16GB (Because is the lowest value between the CPU and Motherboard)\nThe reason behind this Memory Limit relation to the CPU is because of technical modifications by Intel with the latest Core CPUs.\nSo in your case, you have a motherboard that supports 8GB and a CPU that supports 16GB. This means the maximum you can have is 8GB which you can use depending on the amount of slots in the motherboard. In that Asus you have 2 Slots, which means you can have two 4GB of RAM to complete the Maximum of 8GB.\nMore Info about x32abi:\nKernelNewbies - http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.4#head-039c9d273884c9639937c10d68b4a3214869eb4b\nLWN - https://lwn.net/Articles/456731/ (Recommend reading comments for easy to learn explanations about memory limit)\nGoogle - http://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/\nLastly, since Ubuntu 12.04, all 32 Bit versions of Ubuntu come with PAE activated by default so all 32 Bit will support a maximum of 64 GB of RAM. In case you are using 12.04+ and want to know which architecture to use, you now know that you can use any of them as long as you follow some recommendations:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have 512 MB of RAM or less it is highly recommended to use 32 Bit\n\n*If you have less than 4 GB of RAM but more than 512 MB it is recommended to use 32 Bit (But you can still use 64 Bit)\n\n*If you have 4 GB of RAM it is recommended to use 32 Bit (But you can still use 64 Bit)\n\n*If you have between 4 GB or RAM and 64 GB of RAM you can use either 32 Bit or 64 Bit, but it is recommended to use 64 Bit.\n\n*If you have more than 64 GB of RAM you need to use 64 Bit\n\nA: It is a restriction on the motherboard not on the CPU. The CPU may be able to support up to 16GB but if the motherboard can only take 8GB then that's your limit. \nIn Ubuntu if you're running 32-bit then your limit is 4GB and if you're running 64-bit it's much higher (can't remember for certain but it's way way above 16GB. \nBut you will always be restricted by your hardware. You must always compare the motherboard limit and the CPU limit and take the lowest value as the PC's limit.\n\nA: In your specific case, 8 GB is due to your motherboard not supporting any more than that amount of RAM.\nBut Ubuntu itself supports 4 GB max for 32 bit , 64 GB on 32-bit PAE and 128 GB on 64 bit (although theoretically the cap is much higher for 64 bit).\n\nA: there were many questions what determines size of a pointer. basically as a rule of thumb you can say this is processor architecture,\nx86 -> 4 bytes pointer -> can address 4,294,967,296 locations = 4GB (it is the limit)\n\nx64 -> 8 bytes pointer -> can address 1.84467440737e+19 locations (it is the limit, big, eh)\n\nTo address 8GB of RAM you need 8,589,934,592 mappings and pointer of size 4 bytes cannot address all possible values. so this is why I cannot have more than 4GB RAM on x86 architecture.\nThere are some other possibilities though:\n\nAmount of RAM is not limited by the architecture (32 or 64 bit).\n  Architecture only decides how much memory can be addressed at a time,\n  by the OS and the programs running on it. On a 32-bit machine, that\n  is, a machine with 32-bit wide memory bus, the OS and the programs can\n  \"see\" only 4 GB of memory. But that doesn't mean there is only 4 GB of\n  RAM. If the manufacturer has provided for it, you can have 16 GB or\n  4x4 GB of RAM. In that case, there will be 2 more \"hidden\" address\n  lines and also there'd be hardcoded logic to decide the levels of\n  those 2 lines, thus selecting any of the available 4 GB RAMs - 00 01\n  10 11 . These \"hidden\" address bits are not used by the software\n  layers, so for these layers, they can only use a 4-byte pointer. The\n  number of these \"hidden\" address lines decides by how much you can\n  extend your RAM.\nThis is just one example. It depends on the vendor, how they decide to\n  provide for the extra RAM.\n\nsee also:\n\nIn the usual case, a pointer is large enough to hold more addresses\n  than there are units of memory in the system. This introduces the\n  possibility that a program may attempt to access an address which\n  corresponds to no unit of memory, either because not enough memory is\n  installed (i.e. beyond the range of available memory) or the\n  architecture does not support such addresses. The first case may, in\n  certain platforms such as the Intel x86 architecture, be called a\n  segmentation fault (segfault). The second case is possible in the\n  current implementation of AMD64, where pointers are 64 bit long and\n  addresses only extend to 48 bits. There, pointers must conform to\n  certain rules (canonical addresses), so if a noncanonical pointer is\n  dereferenced, the processor raises a general protection fault.\nOn the other hand, some systems have more units of memory than there\n  are addresses. In this case, a more complex scheme such as memory\n  segmentation or paging is employed to use different parts of the\n  memory at different times. The last incarnations of the x86\n  architecture support up to 36 bits of physical memory addresses, which\n  were mapped to the 32-bit linear address space through the PAE paging\n  mechanism. Thus, only 1/16 of the possible total memory may be\n  accessed at a time. Another example in the same computer family was\n  the 16-bit protected mode of the 80286 processor, which, though\n  supporting only 16 MiB of physical memory, could access up to 1 GiB of\n  virtual memory, but the combination of 16-bit address and segment\n  registers made accessing more than 64 KiB in one data structure\n  cumbersome. Some restrictions of ANSI pointer arithmetic may have been\n  due to the segmented memory models of this processor family.[citation\n  needed]\nIn order to provide a consistent interface, some architectures provide\n  memory-mapped I/O, which allows some addresses to refer to units of\n  memory while others refer to device registers of other devices in the\n  computer. There are analogous concepts such as file offsets, array\n  indices, and remote object references that serve some of the same\n  purposes as addresses for other types of objects.\n\n(more here)\n", "Q: How to uninstall Ubuntu 12.04 in dell inspirion 14r laptop? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to uninstall Ubuntu from a dual boot system? \n\nHow to uninstall Ubuntu 12.04 completely from dell inspirion 14r laptop?

Because it is neither possible to (easily) configure it to shut up, nor is it possible to (easily) remove it without breaking other things.\nUnfortunately, the useful editor \"gedit\" won't install without it. Apparently it has a built-in zeitgeist plugin.\nSo, my question is: is it possible to install gedit without this zeitgeist thing?\nUpdate: \nManual configuration is not what I'm looking for - I have 30+ users (remotely connected) - should all users need to do this configuration tuning manually? \nHow does one start System Settings from a remote terminal at all? \nIs it possible to disable this zeitgeist from one place for all users once and forever?\n\nA: First, uninstall the zeitgeist package and allow gedit to be automatically uninstalled. Then:\nsudo su\napt-get download gedit\napt-get download gedit-plugins\n\ndpkg --force-all -i gedit_3.6.0-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb gedit-plugins_3.6.0-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb \n\nJust did this on Xubuntu 12.10 and it seems to be work fine on my system. Note that the exact name of the deb files will differ. You should disable the zeitgiest plugin which will still be installed in gedit, since presumably it won't work anyways. \n(note: dpkg command borrowed from this question):\nHow can I install a package without installing some dependencies?\n\nA: You can prevent Zeitgeist from logging particular applications by adding them to a black list. \nIn Ubuntu 12.04, simply go to System Settings and click on Privacy (in the Personal section). Then hit the Applications tab and add gedit to the list.\n\nA: Try:\n  apt-get install --no-install-recommends gedit\n\nIt only installs the libzeitgeist library but not the full zeitgeist package.\n", "Q: How can I assign the key Super+M» to minimize all windows in Ubuntu 12.04?

Any help greatly appreciated. screenshot provided. many thanks!\n\nA: If your 58.35 GB partition (ext4) is the system root partition, or your /home, or your /boot partition, you can't modify it when the system is running. That's because you have to unmount the patition you want to resize.\nIf that's your case, you can use a live CD or live USB linux distribution and run a partition manager program. I think the best choise is GParted Live. It is a linux distro based on Debian. When you boot it, it automatically runs a partition manager called GParted.\nThis is the GParted official Website:\nhttp://gparted.sourceforge.net/\nNOTE:\nYou can use an Ubuntu Live CD (or another live distro) too. You just have to install, for example, GParted on it and you will have the same partition manager program.\nBut if your ext4 patition doesn't have system files, you can unmount it and use Gparted (by installing it from the Ubuntu Software Center) to resize it.\nSorry for my extremly poor english.\nRegards!\nAriel\n", "Q: Expect script: wait for completion I'm using an expect script to connect to a windows machine and execute an ant script.

I'm used to using workspace/desktop managers in Windows like Dexpot and sDesk that give me a \"panner\" or \"desktop preview\" that shows thumbnails of the windows in each desktop, and lets me click in a desktop to move to that desktop, or drag windows from within the panner/manager to move the actual window.\nI just installed Ubuntu 12.04, and I'm finding that the default workspace manager seems pretty minimal.  Are there better options for a workspace manager, or is there a way to make the workspace manager more functional?\n\nA: When logging in you can select a different window manager, such as Gnome. I think it has the feature you're looking for.\nAt the login screen, click the cog wheel and select the window manager of your preference.\nIf the manger you're looking for isn't there, just search for it in the software center. Some options: \"gnome\", \"lxde\".\nEdit: Or in case you like to stick to Unity, you can install the CompizConfig Settings Manager and you can change some settings there.\nEdit2: You can also install a \"workspace indicator\" which kind of fulfills a similar purpose as the \"panner\" you're talking about.

On a default installation of 11.04 desktop (running inside a VM), I'm getting a strange phenomena in which occasionally some people can't ssh into their account in the regular way (they simply get a \"connection timed out\"), but can connect if they change their external IP address (e.g. use iphone tethering, or a socks proxy through some remote server.)\nI suspect that it may be connected to several failed connection/authentication attempts that those people reported having a short time before this IP-blocking started for each of them.\nIs there anything in 11.04 that auto-blocks IPs for whatever reason? If so, what is this and how can I release a block manually? If not I guess I'll have to investigate in the host machine and in the router...\n\nA: There's nothing by default that does this.\nHowever, you may have fail2ban or something installed that is monitoring attempt logs and banning temporarily.

However, if there's something wrong with the shortcut, it just doesn't do anything.  For instance, I tried to create a shortcut for this command line to create a shortcut.  When I double-click it, it just does nothing.\nThis is the resulting text of my \"Create Desktop Shortcut.desktop\" file on the desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon[en_CA]=gnome-panel-launcher\nExec=/usr/bin/gnome-desktop-item-edit ~/Desktop/ --create-new\nName[en_CA]=Create Desktop Shortcut\nName=Create Desktop Shortcut\nIcon=gnome-panel-launcher\n\nAs I said, when I double-click this, or right-click it and select Open, nothing happens.  Is there a log file where something about this would be written to?\n\nA: To create Desktop shortcuts in Ubuntu,gnome-panel package is required first.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal. To open terminal click the Dash home from Unity launcher. And type terminal in the search field. And click Terminal.\n\n*Type the below code in terminal and hit enter.\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gnome-panel\n\n\n*Then type below code in terminal and hit enter\ngnome-desktop-item-edit ~/Desktop/ --create-new\n\n\n*The create launcher window will pop-up,Type application name in the name field and type application name or path or browse in the command field. And click OK button.\n\nExample: CinePaint\n\n*Now check your desktop for the shortcut.\n\n\n*If you want your shortcut to appear in the Unity launcher panel (the pop-out one on the left), you can drag it there from the desktop.\n\nA: My experience with 12.04 in this respect is utterly weird. First of all, when I \"upgraded\" from 10.04 to 12.04, most of the previous desktop icons survived the transition and worked. The old Open Office icons were there, but did not work because the programs had been removed in the course of the upgrade.\nFor some programs, such as Calculator, I find that I can just drag the icon from the Dash to the desktop, and it works right away. For others, such as all of the Libre Office programs, the dragged item does not work but gives a message of \"broken link.\" There is no possibility of fixing it, because when you right-click it and look at the Properties, you cannot edit the command field.\nThe suggestion to find the application in /usr/share/applications and use \"Make link\" never worked for me because \"Make link\" was gray on all the icons I looked at. Dragging or copying from this directory also produced \"broken link\" messages. \nHow to get good desktop shortcuts for ALL installed programs -- shortcuts that both work right and look right -- is still for me an open question.\nI was able to get working icons for these programs by (a) noting down the \"command\" found by right-clicking on the icon in /usr/share/applications and selecting Properties, and then (b) using the gnome-desktop-item-edit program in a terminal window to create the icon and then right-clicking on it, selecting Properties, and editing the Command field to show the command noted in step (a). This process gives a working icon, but it does not have the proper picture. Rather, the picture is always just the Gnome footprint symbol.\n\nA: The following line is the culprit:\nExec=/usr/bin/gnome-desktop-item-edit ~/Desktop/ --create-new\n\nThe user HOME path ~ will not be expanded in a .desktop file. Please use to full path to get it working:\nExec=/usr/bin/gnome-desktop-item-edit /home/<user>/Desktop/ --create-new\n\n\nA: The simplest answer is this: drag the software icon to the desktop, right-click on it and select Properties → Permissions tab → check mark the \"Allow to Execute\" (or something like that) checkbox. Voila.\n\nA: Found it utterly simple to create shortcuts (on your desktop  or anywhere else) in Ubuntu 12.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the file or folder\n\n*Click on \"Make Link\"\n\n*A link will get created (folder icon with a curvy arrow)\n\n*Cut/copy and paste the link wherever you choose to\n\n\nI have seen that this works as well for executables / programs.\n\nA: Another method is searching for the application within the Unity dash and dragging it over to your Desktop as a shortcut/launcher. You can then modify an existing one by right clicking on it and modifying it's properties, or editing the .desktop file in a terminal if you prefer.\n\nA: Let us assume your source folder is in directory '/home/blah/' and you want to move it to Desktop. \nHow about you create a link to the folder* in ' /home/blah/' and then drag and drop the link to your desktop. The link is a shortcut to the folder. \n\n\n*\n\n*you can create a link to a folder by right clicking and then clicking 'Make Link'  in ubuntu 12.10 ( and perhaps also in older versions)\n\n\nA: If you don't have a contextual menu for this purpose (12.04 doesn't have it by default)\nThe best and easiest option for me is to install ubuntu-tweak:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\nubuntu-tweak\n\nIn the Administration → Personnal panel of this tool add the script Create a new launcher\nNow when right clicking on the desktop, in the Scripts sub-menu you will have an entry: Create a new launcher\nPS: Sorry, not sure about the translations, I have it in French.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Freezing (Chrome Runs Out of Memory?) My Ubuntu 12.04 freezes when I open quite a few windows. I use it at work with a dual desktop, so I usually use about 10 different tabs in two different Chrome applications. I assume Chrome runs out of memory, or is it my small Swap partition? \n\nA: If Chrome really runs out of RAM, there are two simple options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add more RAM.\n\n*Open less tabs.\nAnother route it to reduce RAM consumption by other processes, for example, disable what's not used, or switch to XFCE or LXDE desktop environments.\n\nA: When you start swaping your computer will get slow, if you had too little swap, then it wouldn't freeze, instead using too much memory would trigger the kernels Out Of Memory killer, which would then kill the \"Baddest\" process. (usually your graphical server, or processes in chrome, which would result in the \"sad tab\" page, or Firefox.) It doesn't sound like you are running out of swap, most computers will get far too slow when they start using alot of swap.\nTurning off javascript is a major move towards using less memory, but lots of pages wont work, NoScript for Firefox makes this more managable. Also, keep the number of open tabs low, and some sites (IME \"Web 2.0\" news sites like Huffington post are the worst) are much more performance hungry than others.\nA good program to let you see what processes are running on your computer is htop, which you can install from the software center.\n\nA: Chrome is known for using more memory than Firefox. Chrome is written with the assumption that people will happily buy more RAM and then they will want pages to load super-super fast. (And that this behaviour is preferable to using less memory and performing better with 200+ tabs.)\nThere are a number of extensions that help one \"save tabs for later\" like Too Many Tabs and TabCloud.\nAnother option is to open articles in w3m (a text-only browser which uses less memory).\nHTH.\n", "Q: How to add applications and GUI to the minimal Ubuntu? I would like to build a custom Ubuntu from the minimal Ubuntu version. I plan to use the 11.10 version.\nMy question is, how to I add the basic necessary packages like networking, desktop, apt-get, and all the basic stuff?\nI wish to add only the free applications.\nAlso, please specify how to connect to Internet using the command prompt and a GRPS mobile phone?\n\nA: A minimal installation is (or starts out as) a command-line only system, but it does include networking and apt-get. You can use apt-get to install whatever else you need (or if you prefer aptitude, use apt-get to install aptitude and then use aptitude to install whatever else you want).\nSince a minimal Ubuntu installation is command-line only, you cannot use the graphical help viewer from the console to get help. But you can access manual pages with the man command. To get help on the man command, run man man. (Scroll per line with Up and Down, or per page with the PgUp and PgDn or b and Spacebar keys; search by pressing / and quit by pressing q.)\nA minimal Ubuntu system will automatically access the Internet if you plug it into a wired Ethernet network providing an Internet connection. If you use wireless, you'll probably have to configure that manually. (If you're able to use a wired connection until you have your GUI installed, that might save you some hassle.) This question might help with that. Or if you're using Ubuntu 11.04, you can easily install and use cnetworkmanager (a command-line frontend for configuring Network Manager). If you need to install a package to get networking working, you can manually retrieve the .deb file from the CD or from https://launchpad.net/ubuntu, then install it with sudo dpkg -i ... (replacing ... with the name of the .deb file you want to install).\nWith networking working (which might be the case out of the box), you should first update all the packages on your command-line system:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThen you can install a GUI. If you want a fully-featured GUI as though you'd installed regular Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Kubuntu, or Lubuntu, but without the applications that come with them, then you can install one of these packages with the --no-install-recommends flag:\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install xubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install kubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install lubuntu-desktop\nIf you want something more minimal, you can install the X server xorg (which must be present for any GUI on Ubuntu):\nsudo apt-get install xorg\n\nThen install a window manager That must be present for any GUI on Ubuntu to be useful, since otherwise application windows pop up and cannot be moved, hidden, reshown, switched between, resized, and so forth. An exception are \"kiosk\" systems running only one application fullscreen all the time. Lightweight options for a window manager include twm, fluxbox, and openbox, which you'd install with (one of) these commands:\nsudo apt-get install twm\nsudo apt-get install fluxbox\nsudo apt-get install openbox\nTo start your GUI, run startx. Note that it may require substantial manual configuration, for it to be to your liking, depending on your needs.\nIf you want something more sophisticated than X11 and a simple window manager, but less sophisticated than the whole interface provided by a -desktop package, then you can try installing desktop environment packages themselves (like xfce4 for Xfce, the GUI provided in Xubuntu)...but your mileage may vary, as these packages do not always include all the necessary components to make your interface reasonably powerful and useful in Ubuntu.\nSince Ubuntu Server systems, like minimal installations of Ubuntu, are GUIless, the information on the ServerGUI documentation page is partially relevant (though not completely--for example, the arguments against having a GUI probably do not apply to your situation).\nBy the way, links to manual pages in this answer are to the 12.04 LTS version, for maximal usefulness to others...but you can click the 11.10 link at the top of the page to bring up to 11.10 version.\n", "Q: Where is info for specific compiz settings, like \"clone output\" and \"Window Previews\"?

For instance, there are fields labeled \"Clone Output\" and \"Window Previews\", and I can't find any information about exactly what those do.  Is there a place where all of these fields are documented?\n\nA: Try these...

I have dual booted Ubuntu 12.04 on my Mac using disk utility and the rEFIt tool.The battery life is very bad and therefore I want to switch back to Ubuntu 10.04 . How can I completely remove the 12.04 partition?  \n\nA: Since you're switching back to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, you won't want to expand your other OS (I am guessing it's Mac OS X) to fill up the space that had been used for Ubuntu's partitions, because you'll just be installing 10.04 after removing 12.04. This simplifies things.\nIt is a good idea to actually remove the partitions though, to ensure that Ubuntu 10.04 LTS's installer sees unpartitioned space that it can use.\nBoot from the Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS installation CD/DVD or USB flash drive. (It's worth getting that point release's installation media even if you have the original 10.04 LTS installation media or media for an earlier point release.) Select Try Ubuntu without installing (not Install Ubuntu).\nMake sure to back up any data in your Ubuntu partitions, as you'll be deleting them and it's a hassle (and sometimes impossible) to recover data from a deleted partition. It's also a good idea to ensure your backups of documents and other important files in your other OS's partition are current. This is less necessary since you won't be resizing that partition, but you could still make a mistake.\nOpen GParted (System > Administration > GParted Partition Editor). The Ubuntu partitions are of type ext4 and linux-swap (or, if you started with a very old Ubuntu system, ext3 and linux-swap). Remove them, but make sure to keep other partitions. (These other partitions are probably, but not necessarily, of type hfs+, since that's what Mac OS X uses. If your other OS is Windows, then its partitions would probably be ntfs.)\nAfter removing those partitions, click the green check mark to apply your changes. Wait for it to finish. Then quit GParted. Double-click on the Install Ubuntu icon on the desktop, and this will start the Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS installer. When you install, make sure not to tell it to use the whole disk, as this would wipe out your existing (Mac OS X?) operating system.\n", "Q: Mac like MultiTouch support I don't remember how but in 11.10 I had managed to find a few multitouch actions to be supporetd by some software.\nNow I am using 12.04, Is there any way/application/workaround/plugin or anything that can provide me with multitouch gestures similar to mac or atleast near to it?\nWith synaptics I figured out that my touchpad supports 3finger control.\nI am using a Samsung NP-RV509-A0GIN.\n\nA: Touchegg\n\nTouchégg is  a “multitouch gesture recognizer” for Linux,  written in C++ , with Qt and utilizing Ubuntu’s uTouch-geis library.

So add the following PPA  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:utouch-team/daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install utouch  \n\nInstallation\nIn Quantal (12.10), Precise (12.04) and Oneric (11.10) the package is in the repositories as shown here\nEditing the config file\nConfig file is located here\n~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf\nEditing the config file:  \ngedit ~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf\n\nIn the example below, the four finger drag gesture is configured to switch to Show Desktop\nFour Fingers Drag \n[FOUR_FINGERS_DRAG_DOWN]\naction=SHOW_DESKTOP\nsettings=\n\nThree Fingers Drag\n[THREE_FINGERS_DRAG_UP]\naction=MAXIMIZE_RESTORE_WINDOW\nsettings=\n\n[THREE_FINGERS_DRAG_DOWN]\naction=MINIMIZE_WINDOW\nsettings=  \n\nList of more actions here \nThus you can get Mac like multi-touch experience on Linux systems.\nCheck out a demonstation video here and here\nWhich gestures are supported?\nThe following gestures are suppoted  \nOther alternatives\nGinn \n\nA: There's some great advice here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1419833\nEasiest solution is probably just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System/Preferences/Mouse\n\n*Click on the touchpad tab and you can select two finger scrolling under the scrolling heading. \n\n\nIf that fails, you may need to do something like shown below, depending on your hardware:\nxinput set-int-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Two-Finger Scrolling\" 8 1\nxinput set-int-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Two-Finger Scrolling\" 8 1 1\nxinput set-int-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Two-Finger Pressure\" 32 10\nxinput set-int-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Two-Finger Width\" 32 8\n\nYou've gotta run at least these four (more in the link above), and you have to run them on boot, so you'll probably want to drop them into a startup script; preferably one late in the boot process.  \nI'm not sure what make of touchpad you have, so you may have to do a little digging to get the right names and properties to set.\nTo check your input devices for the touchpad, run xinput list and look under the pointer section.  You should have multiple items in the list, and the one with highest id is likely your touchpad.  If it's synaptic, you're golden, and the four commands above will solve you woes.\nIf not, you must dig a little.\nIn The second column of xinput list, each device has id=#\nRun xinput list-props #, where # = your device id.\nThis will show you all the available properties for your input device.\nThe commands above differ from my default settings from the return values of xinput list-props in that the 8s and 32s describe the size of the data being set.  The second and third ints match exactly what xinput list-props returned, but going through the act of setting enabled two finger scrolling for me.\n\nA: @Ashu's answer is pretty much to the point and really complete. But I would like to add one more point to it that would really make your experience better one.\nFirstly I am using Ubuntu 16.04 on my Asus ZenBook UX305 laptop, and touchegg worked very well for me in this configuration.\nYou could customize your three finger left and three finger right drags to change workspaces, using as Ashu pointed out changing the config file for touchegg.\n(to open config file you can also go to home then Ctrl+H access hidden folders to find .config folder. Inside it there is a folder related to touchegg. where the config file for touchegg id present!)\nOpening the config file you can change the default action to the shortcut keys Ctrl+Alt+Right and Ctrl+Alt+Left for three finger drag left and three finger drag right. (hoe to do possible gestures are in the link provided by Ashu) . Doing this you can enjoy three finger drag in Ubuntu as well.\nI have uploaded the picture of my config file here in which i highlighted the edit i made from the default touchegg config file.\n(Make sure you enabled multiple workspaces in ubuntu with all workspaces aligned horizontally, in case you havent check  How can I reduce or increase the number of workspaces in Unity?)\nYou can also use this tutorial as it covers all my points and probably also fixes errors.

The settings in print to file option in Ubuntu is limiting and dangerous. All the applications apart from Mozilla print to a  file ~/output.pdf, this is dangerous as you can overwrite a previous print.\nEdit: I have been informed you are asked whether you wish to overwrite, unlike in cups-pdf\nWhy can't applications use the title of the document, the filename or the page title of the web page?\nWhat package and where are the settings of this print to file held. I would prefer it printing to the desktop if it cannot intuitively chose a filename, as when it arrives on the desktop it would be a visual reminder for me to change the filename.\nPreviously I did not use the print to file feature, as the cups-pdf didn't have these short comings.

How do I report a bug? may be helpful.\nNevertheless, to get to your question in bold. Each application can manage its print menu. The Libre suite seems to go for exporting a .pdf file over printing to a file. For gedit the answer is: ~/.config/gedit/gedit-print-settings.

Grub2 uses /boot/grub/grub.cfg and is generated automatically when you invoke update-grub command So you can not edit it.\nyou MUST edit /etc/default/grub or /etc/grub.d/ but Never edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nA: /etc/default/grub is a user editable file which is used by update-grub and grub-mkconfig to construct /boot/grub/grub.cfg which is not usually edited by users.  Some experimenters and such edit it anyway knowing [or not] that their changes will be wiped out the next time update-grub is run.\nThere is another set of files in /etc/grub.d/ which are scripts used by grub-mkconfig in the process of making /boot/grub/grub.cfg.  This is another common place to work grub magic.\n\nA: The first, /etc/default/grub is the one you should edit. The second one, /boot/grub/grub.cfg, is produced by runing update-grub. There are comments in the beginning of each of those files reminding you of which is which. It mentions grub-mkconfig but that's a program that is run by update-grub.\nThe first one only has rather permanent information that tell update-grub what you want. The second merges that information with what operating systems you had on your system at the time you ran update-grub and is what grub itself uses to produce the boot menu.\nTo see information on using the /etc/default/grub use the info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration' command.\nMost people don't have to mess with any of this.

This is one of its advantages, though if you want to use Ubuntu a lot or as your primary system, you might consider doing a standard installation alongside your Windows system (which does require repartitioning, though the installer can do it automatically for you).\nSee the official Wubi installation instructions for more information about how Wubi works, how it gives you an Ubuntu installation without needing repartitioning, and how to install it.\n\nA: Wubi is an alternative method of installation for new Linux users.

But today when I opened Netbeans, it just got stuck in the Ubuntu launcher bar at the left side of screen.\nI have my project pending in Netbeans (which is not opening). I am stuck in this problem.\nI also rebooted Ubuntu a number of times, still the same. I can't open Netbeans.\nWhy is this happening? What is the cause of this problem? What should I do?\ntried $gksu netbeans, nothing happens, $ prompt shown again.\n\nA: I finally re-installed netbeans and restarted the system before trying to open it.\n\nA: If you have recently upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 and installed Netbeans manually in 11.10 (or older), you'll find out that netbeans cannot start with the following error:\nCannot find java. Please use the --jdkhome switch.\n\nThis is because the path for the Java Runtime Environment has slightly changed. Before, it was something like /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre. In Ubuntu 12.04, this path has become is /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/. (or i386 if you have a 32-bit OS)\nTo solve this problem without reinstalling Netbeans, open the file netbeans-7.1.1/etc/netbeans.conf (the path for 7.0.1 should not differ a lot). Find the line:\nnetbeans_jdkhome=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk\"\n\nand replace it by:\nnetbeans_jdkhome=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64\"\n\nThe next time you start netbeans, the issue should be gone.\n\nA: Open your Terminal, run sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-pixbuf, and try again.\n", "Q: Is there a GUI to edit the PATH variable? There's a GUI in Windows to edit the path variable. I was wondering if there's something equivalent in Ubuntu to do the same. \n\nA: Thing is... path is set inside several text files based on what you want to accomplish, like in ~/.profile for the user, /etc/profile as a default for users, /etc/environment for the system or /etc/bash.bashrc for system wide interactive bash shells. In some of these $PATH is set as part of some coding.\nSo a text editor is the most logical thing to use. Like gedit if you want it graphical but you will still be looking at the same type of deal as with nano or vi from commandline. But it will not be possible with something where you edit in some directories with an input box to browse directories since in Linux PATH can have some more logic to it than simply editing a variable. \nMy advice: get used to command line editing for things like this and similar things. It will one day help you fix your problems when not being able to login or Unity crashing just after login. \nThere is more likely to be a reason for it being done this way. Linux has many more ways of doing things then either of us will ever use but that does not mean someone else does not need them. \n\nFor Latex I would suggest adding it to /etc/bash.bashrc. That is the place to edit path for system wide bash shells. \ngksu gedit /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nAfter adding it in and saving you can check with\necho $PATH\n\nif it is set correctly (and this will be permament).\n", "Q: Finding stations for Rhythmbox I can Google for stations I'd like to listen to, but I can't find the correct URL to put into Rhythmbox for them to work. \nDo I need to find stations that offer a specific kind of protocol? \ni.e. \"PLS\" (playlist?) Where are some top-notch places to find stations?\n\nA: Shoutcast\nShoutcast is a massive selection of individual radio stations (over 700 pages). There are so many stations that it is intimidating to even find one.\nHow to add Radio Stations to Rhythmbox?\n\n*\n\n*Vist Shoutcast, find your favorite radio station, right click on it and select Save Link As, Save it in your music library.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on .pls file you just downloaded and select Open with Rhythmbox.\n\n\n*Alternatively, instead of saving the .pls file just copy the link location, in Rhythmbox select Radios in side bar and click on add, enter the link there and save it.\n\n\n\n*3rd option is to open the .pls file in Gedit and copy the address from there and add it to Rhythmbox.\n\nAlternative:\nOr just install Guayadeque. Listen and browse the complete Shoutcast collection (Over 5,700 stations) and many other radio stations right from your desktop. It's available in Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n\nA: When I want to get the url of a radio stream I check the source code of the radio player.\nE.g this dutch radio station \nGet the source code of the page and  go to line 147, you will see this\n{ codec: 'asx', url: 'http://livestreams.omroep.nl/npo/3fm-bb', stream: true }\n\nAdd the url  to rhytmbox and voila.\n\nA: http://listenlive.eu has a good database with easy access to the playlist files that Rhythmbox can make use of.\n\nA: Yes a good answer from Basharat Sial. \nIt is too bad RhythmBox still cannot open downloaded .pls files by just clicking them. It was reported as a bug on 2006-10-04 (LP bug #62430), and still nobody had this fixed. Anyway if you want RhythmBox to run a specific .pls file you can open your terminal and run this:\nrhythmbox-client --play-uri=[PATH HERE]\n\nThis solution was given under the discussion of the bug, but it is a long discussion and it can be difficult to spot it.

I am planning to package FBuntu into PPA for easier distribution. \nThe nature of this app is that the user has to make specific edits to the auth.py file to make it work and hence I am stuck from proceeding any further. \nA default first couple of lines of auth.py looks like this:\nimport facebook\n\nclass facebookAuthentication:\n    def __init__(self):\n        url = \"https://...\"\n        self.parse_url(url)\n\nThe user after branching FBuntu from the bazaar, has to manually edit the url with the one you get after authenticating with Facebook. I have no idea on how to make an app be edited after a deb package has been generated. \nAny guidance on how to proceed with packaging this would be welcome. \n\nA: I'm not sure what this question has to do with packaging. Users shouldn't have to be editing the python files directly, and of course would need to be root to do so to installed one. What you really want is a proper conf file installed to the users home directory. Something like:\nimport os\nimport ConfigParser\n\ntry:\n    import xdg.BaseDirectory\nexcept ImportError:\n    home = os.environ.get('HOME')\n    xdg_config_home = os.path.join(home, '.config/')\nelse:\n    xdg_config_home = xdg.BaseDirectory.xdg_config_home\n\nconfDir =  os.path.join(xdg_config_home, 'myApp')\nconfFile =  os.path.join(confDir, 'conf.ini')\n\nconfig = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()\n\nif os.path.isfile(confFile):\n    config.read(confFile)\n    print \"The URL is \" + config.get('Section', 'url')\nelse:\n    print \"URL not set.

You might want to implement a preferences window.\n\nA: Because of your \"very specific url\" comment I gather using gwibber is not an option.\nI maintain a couple year old python application originally put together with Quickly. Even if you don't want to use Quickly to put together your app, Quickly uses a modified setup.py file to modify a very small Python module. As the app. is built setup.py is called from the make sequence (usual) and a modification to setup.py changes one small but important detail regarding whether the program has been installed or whether it is being tested. I suppose you could use the same approach to change a different kind of detail.\nStill, leaving an application generalized and having it read a config (preference) file would be the standard way to customize a program's operation, if at all possible. So if you can use andrewsomething's suggetion I think that would be better.\n", "Q: Dual-monitor (TwinView) vertical, rotated display: how to make mouse span horizontally?

Since I installed Ubuntu 12.04 (fresh, not upgrade), my wifi is much weaker than before and much weaker than under Windows XP. \nThere is a noticeable difference in required sensitivity: It doesn't establish a connection unless I carry the notebook directly to the hotspot (so that the indicator shows 3 or 4 bars). However afterwards the connection breaks only when I move farther away (1-2 bars).\n(Side note: I remember my 9.04 had stronger wifi than XP.)\nMy wireless interface is wlan0 and with sudo lspci -nn I found that my network controller is:\nNetwork controller [0280]: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection [8086:4222] (rev 02)\n\nShould I report it as a bug?\nIs there a configuration how I can improve it?\n\nA: Do not trust the bars... 5 full bars might be lots of noise and just 2 bars might be without noise. More about this here (is about Windows but same physics apply for Ubuntu). There is a better method: more /proc/net/wireless shows quality of the link, signal strength and noise level.\nExample:\nrinzwind@discworld:~$ more /proc/net/wireless \nInter-| sta-|   Quality        |   Discarded packets               | Missed | WE\n face | tus | link level noise |  nwid  crypt   frag  retry   misc | beacon | 22\n wlan0: 0000   57.  -53.  -256        0      0      0     34   1185        0\n\nFor each device, the following information is given:\n\n\n*\n\n*Status : Its current state.

The Quality - level might help him to track shadow areas.\nThe basic difference between Quality - link and Quality - level is that the first indicate how good the reception is (for example the percentage of correctly received packets) and the second how strong the signal is.

The appropriate debs can be found in the Debian repositories here. You can't install them directly on the router, so extract with dpkg-deb -x filename.deb destination-dir first.\nYou can then try moving the extracted files to your router, and seeing if the binaries appear to work. If not, you can always (cross-)compile them from source. I don't see anything in apt-cacher-ng that should prevent it from working on a non-Debian-based system.\n\nAlternative: Use the OpenWRT packages\nThere's also an apt-cacher-ng branch for OpenWRT on Github here, and it looks like it's being actively updated. DD-WRT runs on a superset of the hardware supported by OpenWRT, so it would almost certainly compile and work on your system.

This is what I have gathered from the past year and half (Since Ubuntu 10.04 up to 12.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*Nvidia video cards (Using proprietary or open source drivers) create less heat and have less temperature than using them on the same hardware with Windows. In this case Windows 7. Of course the temperature I am talking about is not something like 72 Degrees Celsius. My tests are in Windows around 40-42 Degrees while in Ubuntu they are around 33 Degrees. Almost 10 degrees less. When playing the same game they go in Windows up to 49-51 while on Windows they go to 39-41. Not only this but in the case of the Nvidia 9800 that a friend has, he told me that Ubuntu tok care of the Video card so good that it never passed the 60 Degree limit he was afraid of. On Windows the video card was around 55 without doing nothing. 70 easy while playing. On Ubuntu it was 38. 50-56 while playing. He even bought 3 fans to cool down the video card. Does not need them anymore.\n\n*Intel Video cards run great and are the same thing on Windows than Ubuntu.\n\n*Hard drives LAST LONGER. This is something not much limited to Laptops. This tests have only been with HDD not with SSD. But I have tested around 30-40 hard drives in the ranges from 250GB up to 3TB. From Western Digital, Hitachi to Samsung and Seagate (Before the WD merge). Hard drives that have started to have problems have somehow being brought back to life in Ubuntu. Other hard drives that made a screech sound when rebooting do not make it when loading on Ubuntu. And the life span of Hard drives is about 2 years longer. I can vouch for this at least for a test I did buying 4 HDD Samsung Spinpoint F3 of 1TB each. 2 were used in Windows. 2 in Ubuntu. Guess which ones started dying out. Yeap, the Windows ones. They started developing a huge amount of bad sectors and not only that but one of them started making strange noises when booting or rebooting. After a couple of weeks of this, it died. The other one that was on Windows I moved it to Ubuntu and I am using it as backup right now. This was around May 2011. Basically a year ago and it is still working.\n\n*Hard Drives are faster. Tested this with a Samsung Spinpoint F3 and a 3TB Seagate. using Windows 7 versus Ubuntu 12.04 I could see (Not just a burst/cache but an actual stable speed) that on Windows 7 I was gettings around 50-60MB/s speed in all HDDs. In Ubuntu I got 90MB/s with the Spinpoints and 140MB with the 3TB Seagate. It was really taking advantage of the Sata and the technology around the HDD.\n\n*Hard Drives are better monitored. Have you tried Disk Utility. If I were a robot man (50% there already), my wife would be that utility. It has a very good way of monitoring the HDD and notifying you when they have a problem.\n\n*Battery Life - This was a problem for a long time in Linux. It was solved in the 3.3 version of the Kernel. I am guessing you would ask: But 12.04 is using the 3.2 version not the 3.3. you are correct but many features of the 3.3 were backported. This was one. Others like performance enhancements and video enhancements for Intel were also backported. So you have a 12.04 that has a very good battery life again.\n\n*Battery Recovery - If the following has happened to you, you can fix it with Ubuntu. Already tested on 3 laptops. If you have a battery that Ubuntu says has less Watts than it should you can discharge the battery until it is completely depleted. you can do this effectively with Ubuntu. Somehow it correctly makes sure the battery is 100% dead. Leave it charging for several hours (12 minimum) and then started up with Ubuntu. You will see an increase of at least 100%. Some cases like the HP DV6000 I have went from 88W power to 114W. I tested this and the laptop which never ever lasted for me over 2 hours (When new) lasted almost 3 hours. The good thing about Ubuntu is that it tells you have charge the battery is and how long it will really last after doing this \"Battery reset\". It does a beautiful job and analysing the battery, battery usage, power usage, etc..\nyou can get the idea after reading all of this that using Ubuntu or any other Linux OS for that matter should make your laptop last several months/years longer. Got an additional case of a cousin in Aruba that has an Acer REALLYY old model that was having problems with Windows XP and the battery, wifi and video. I install Ubuntu on the laptop. It is still working today. Guess what version of Ubuntu I installed.. 6.10. Almost 6 years ago his laptop was going to die.\nIn the end you can test both of them on the same hardware I see it for yourself. You can come to this question in a year or two to give your thoughts about how it all went.\n\nA: \nI want to make sure that Ubuntu is not going to reduce longevity of my laptop or going to harm my laptop parts\n\nNo. In general it is almost impossible for software to unintentionally damage hardware.\n\nA: Ubuntu is always safe, on every hardware.\nRemember to always properly shutdown or reboot your computer and everything should work well for a long, long time. \n\nA: Any Linux operating system is always safe to use... :)\nDefinitely better than...You know what i am saying...\nThere are so many people who also port Ubuntu to their MACs..!!\nMACs are obviously costly machines..!! But Ubuntu runs in Peace with everyone.. ;)\nYou do not need to worry...Stay with Linux/Ubuntu and be the safest person on earth ;)\nJust be sure you dont do anything Intentionaly as said in other answers..!! ;)\n\nA: Even my friend got the same laptop and I installed it a few months ago with Ubuntu 11.04 and its very nice, He didn't complained till date.\n", "Q: How to use alternate config file when compiling the Kernel? I am using Ubuntu 12.04 as host, and I plan to compile a new kernel. I downloaded the Linux-Libre kernel.

How to use the alternate configuration ?\n\nA: \nI have an alternate kernel config, which is not the default Ubuntu config. How to use the alternate configuration ?\n\nIt is as simple as copying the alternate .config to the top-level linux kernel source directory. You can check if it's the top-level by verifying with ls that the Kbuild or Kconfig files exist in the directory.\nThen compile your kernel as usual (make-kpkg, etc.).\n", "Q: Headphone jack does not cut speakers in 12.04 When I connecting my headphones to laptop, the speakers is still working. Where is the problem?\n\nA: Could you please report a bug and make your comment on the bellow link for permanent solution??\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/995684\n\nA: Looks like a hardware problem, not related to Ubuntu (to me, at least). In most cases, the headphone connector is designed in such a ways that inserting a headphone jack cuts of the signal that goes to speakers.\n\nA: Same issue, always worked perfectly until I dist-upgrade'd to 12.04. Have a Acer Aspire8930. Pluging in headphones works, I don't get sound through headphones. However, like described earlier in this thread, the speakers in the laptop are still making noise.\nCutting the volume using the volume in Ubuntu causes the headphones to be cut off also.\nOnly way to cut the speakers is to open a console and run alsamixer. Then fiddle around turning centre / side / surround and LFE down. The alsamixer doesn't work like before with me though, as sometimes sliders are turned up while I'm moving up or down a completely other slider. Seems like the sound system in 12.04 is kinda bugged for some setups / hardware.\n", "Q: Raid 5 mdadm Problem - Help Please My Raid 5 array (4 1tb Disks WD10EARS) had was showing as degraded.\nI looked and one of the disks wasnt installed, so i re-added it with the mdadm add command.\nthe array is now showing as (null)Array , but cant be mounted\nif i run:\nroot@warren-P5K-E:/home/warren# sudo mdadm --misc --detail /dev/md0\n\nI get:\nmdadm: cannot open /dev/md0: No such file or directory\n\nand running:\nroot@warren-P5K-E:/home/warren# cat /proc/mdstat \n\ngives me:\nPersonalities : [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [raid10]\n\nunused devices: < none >\n\nThe data is very important\n\nroot@warren-P5K-E:/home/warren# mdadm --examine /dev/sda\n/dev/sda:\n          Magic : a92b4efc\n        Version : 0.90.00\n           UUID : 00000000:00000000:00000000:00000000\n  Creation Time : Sat May 26 12:08:14 2012\n     Raid Level : -unknown-\n   Raid Devices : 0\n  Total Devices : 4\nPreferred Minor : 0\n\n    Update Time : Sat May 26 12:08:40 2012\n          State : active\n Active Devices : 0\nWorking Devices : 4\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 4\n       Checksum : 82d5b792 - correct\n         Events : 1\n\n\n      Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\nthis     1       8        0        1      spare   /dev/sda\n\n   0     0       8       16        0      spare   /dev/sdb\n   1     1       8        0        1      spare   /dev/sda\n   2     2       8       32        2      spare   /dev/sdc\n   3     3       8       48        3      spare   /dev/sdd\n\nroot@warren-P5K-E:/home/warren# mdadm --examine /dev/sdb\n/dev/sdb:\n          Magic : a92b4efc\n        Version : 0.90.00\n           UUID : 00000000:00000000:00000000:00000000\n  Creation Time : Sat May 26 12:08:14 2012\n     Raid Level : -unknown-\n   Raid Devices : 0\n  Total Devices : 4\nPreferred Minor : 0\n\n    Update Time : Sat May 26 12:08:40 2012\n          State : active\n Active Devices : 0\nWorking Devices : 4\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 4\n       Checksum : 82d5b7a0 - correct\n         Events : 1\n\n\n      Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\nthis     0       8       16        0      spare   /dev/sdb\n\n   0     0       8       16        0      spare   /dev/sdb\n   1     1       8        0        1      spare   /dev/sda\n   2     2       8       32        2      spare   /dev/sdc\n   3     3       8       48        3      spare   /dev/sdd\nroot@warren-P5K-E:/home/warren# \noot@warren-P5K-E:/home/warren# mdadm --examine /dev/sdc\n/dev/sdc:\n          Magic : a92b4efc\n        Version : 0.90.00\n           UUID : 00000000:00000000:00000000:00000000\n  Creation Time : Sat May 26 12:08:14 2012\n     Raid Level : -unknown-\n   Raid Devices : 0\n  Total Devices : 4\nPreferred Minor : 0\n\n    Update Time : Sat May 26 12:08:40 2012\n          State : active\n Active Devices : 0\nWorking Devices : 4\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 4\n       Checksum : 82d5b7b4 - correct\n         Events : 1\n\n\n      Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\nthis     2       8       32        2      spare   /dev/sdc\n\n   0     0       8       16        0      spare   /dev/sdb\n   1     1       8        0        1      spare   /dev/sda\n   2     2       8       32        2      spare   /dev/sdc\n   3     3       8       48        3      spare   /dev/sdd\nroot@warren-P5K-E:/home/warren# mdadm --examine /dev/sdd\n/dev/sdd:\n          Magic : a92b4efc\n        Version : 0.90.00\n           UUID : 00000000:00000000:00000000:00000000\n  Creation Time : Sat May 26 12:08:14 2012\n     Raid Level : -unknown-\n   Raid Devices : 0\n  Total Devices : 4\nPreferred Minor : 0\n\n    Update Time : Sat May 26 12:08:40 2012\n          State : active\n Active Devices : 0\nWorking Devices : 4\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 4\n       Checksum : 82d5b7c6 - correct\n         Events : 1\n\n\n      Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\nthis     3       8       48        3      spare   /dev/sdd\n\n   0     0       8       16        0      spare   /dev/sdb\n   1     1       8        0        1      spare   /dev/sda\n   2     2       8       32        2      spare   /dev/sdc\n   3     3       8       48        3      spare   /dev/sdd\n\nThat on the 4 drives.\n\nA: You array status shows all your members as SPARES not MEMBERS.

When I open a terminal using CTRL+ALT+T in Unity, I would like this window to be automatically maximized, rather than to have to additionally hit ALT+SPACE and the 'X' key to make the window that contains it maximized.\nIf my memory serves me right, I do remember that there used to be a maximize mode that we can set in preferences, but I can't seem to find it now. Any ideas?\n\nA: Go to System Settings -> Keyboard. Under the \"Shortcuts\" tab, go to \"Custom Shortcuts\". Create a new entry named \"Launch Terminal Fullscreen\" (or whatever), and enter the following as the command:\ngnome-terminal --window --full-screen\n\nYou're supposed to be able to click on that entry and then press the key combination you wish to use in order to set the new keyboard shortcut, but for some reason, that wasn't working for me.

If you have attempted various other fixes, a reinstall would be easiest way to get it back to correct state, or make the BIOS change and then try a live CD to confirm before reinstalling.\nUbuntu Install on Acer Aspire One 722\nIn case that link stops working, here's a copy of the text :\n\nUnder Ubuntu Natty, the Aspire One 722 wifi adapter is fully supported, but presents a very annoying bug, specific to the AO722\n  hardware.\nIn fact, every time you try to connect to a wireless network, your\n  netbook may freeze, the only option being a hard reset !\nIt seems that this bug comes from a conflict between the ethernet and\n  the wireless adapter.\nBut the good news is that there is a very simple tip to avoid this bug\n  : you need to setup a specific boot order, where the network boot is\n  used first. With this setup, the ethernet adapter will be configured\n  in a way that there won't be any conflict with the wifi adpater at the\n  time of wireless network connexion.\nTo do so, reboot your netbook and enter the BIOS by typing F2 at boot\n  time.\nFirst, set the Network Boot as the first one in the boot priority\n  order :\nNext, be sure that Network Boot is enabled :\nSave and exit.\nAfter reboot, the freeze problem should be part of the past …\n\n\nA: \nThere is a problem with blacklisted drivers.\nFix it with 2 steps, go to directory /etc/modprobe.d, then edit file broadcom-sta-common.conf\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove or comment this line:\nblacklist brcmsmac\n\n\n*Add new line with new blacklist rule:\nblacklist bcma\n\n\n*Reboot and enjoy active Wireless Network connection.\nIt works for me (Samsung Q530). \nWorking example of broadcom-sta-common.conf file shown below.\n# wl module from Broadcom conflicts with ssb\n# We must blacklist the following modules:\nblacklist b44\nblacklist b43legacy\nblacklist b43\nblacklist brcm80211\n# CHANGE STARTS HERE\n#blacklist brcmsmac\nblacklist bcma\n# END OF CHANGE\nblacklist ssb\ninstall wl /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install wl $CMDLINE_OPTS\n\n\nA: This list of supported Broadcom hardware suggests wl (broadcom-sta-common in Ubuntu repositories) as an alternative to brcmsmac.\n\nA: Same problem with Broadcom 4313 (but on a Samsung NP305U).

The power failure may have affected your filesystem or the partition table, so you're best off with the Live CD rather than risk messing anything up from within busybox.\n", "Q: Why is Google glog library not present in 12.04?

I would like to leave an application running in my terminal that shows me the memory usage, similar to how top shows CPU and other info, and iotop shows the top I/O users.\n\nDoes such an application exist?\nP.S. I know top shows memory usage as well, but I'm talking about sorting by top memory usage and not showing any other info (similar to what iotop does).\n\nA: The closest I could find is memtop, a Python script available here on Google Code.\nScreenshot:\n\nHow to use memtop\n\n\n*\n\n*It's a Python script, so simply do a sudo mv memtop-1.0.0.py /usr/bin/memtop.py and a chmod +x /path/to/memtop.py to make it executable\n\n*Default update period is 15 min; use switch -p 1 to make it 1 minute, etc. (can't go lower than that unless you modify the source)\n\n*Use -l N, where N is the number of processes you want to show, depending on the size of your terminal.\n\n*Use -m to show \"more\" information, i.e. the Swap/Page stats at the bottom of the screenshot.\n\n\n\nThe htop disguised as memtop option\nIf you don't use htop otherwise, it's pretty easy to set it up with the F2-setup option to look like memtop:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*htop config is stored in ~/.config/htop/htoprc, so just delete htoprc to restore normal htop.\n\n\nA: I don't know about any specific application for monitoring what you want in real time but I did find some information that might be helpful.\nFirst heres a simple command to print this info ps -e -orss=,args= | sort -b -k1,1n | pr -TW$COLUMNS (found here: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/how-to-show-the-memory-usage-per-process-160181/)\nSecond here is some more info about scripts to do the same:\nhttp://unixlive.editboard.com/t4-memory-usage-retrieval-on-linux-process-wise-and-general\nand\nhttp://unixlive.editboard.com/t5-how-much-ram-is-used-per-program\nYou could write your own script/program to meet your needs.

I know very little about bash scripting or programming but to display the information in realtime you would need to use something like a lot of tail commands with a pipe to sort/print only the desired information for each process.\n\n\nNot really a complete answer, but hopefully this gives you some ideas of what you could try.

Apparently there is no way for these to work with the current xserver.\nFrom what I understood from the info I found, muxless systems are the ones where the integrated chip is always connected to the display. In that case the discrete graphics chip is only used to render the frames, but sends them to the integrated one in order to show them on the display.\nThe counter part of this is ofcourse muxed. In this case both chips (integrated and discrete) are connected to a separate \"thing\" (the mux) and the display is can be switched from one chip to the other using this. This is the setup for which vgaswitcheroo does the trick\nConclusion: I have the impression that all we can do for now is wait until x supports these muxless systems, or maybe wayland will...\n\nA: I use Ubuntu 12.10\nThe workaroud above works fine for me when I want to switch from IGD (which is set after a normal ubuntu-boot) to DIS.\nEverything is fine then, I can use my monitor via HDMI and even HDMI sound output.\nBut if I want to switch back from DIS to IGD it does not work.\nEither I get the message\n client 101 refused switch\n\nor even\n [drm:atom_op_jump] *ERROR* atombios stuck in loop for more than 1sec aborting\n\nIt does only help to reboot then with ALT + PRINT + REISUB.\nAny ideas? :-/\n", "Q: How to fix \"-5 No address associated with hostname error\" while updating? I am getting this error frequently while updating Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. How can I fix it? Log is:\nIgn http://archive.scrapy.org precise/main Translation-en\nFetched 6,620 kB in 1min 21s (81.2 kB/s)\nW: Failed to fetch http://archive.scrapy.org/ubuntu/dists/precise/Release.gpg\nSomething wicked happened resolving 'archive.scrapy.org:http' (-5 - No address associated with hostname)\n\n\nA: http://archive.scrapy.org/ seems like a perfectly working Ubuntu mirror, so while I'd usually ask you to provide information about what Software Sources are configured, it looks like this problem is either specific to your Ubuntu system, or was a short-lived problem with (or accessing) your DNS server. (The problem is not actually with the server at http://archive.scrapy.org/ itself, though it may have been due to a configuration problem for that server's DNS record.)\nThis is, of course, assuming that you have Internet access on the affected machine. If you don't, then you need to connect to the Internet before updating. It's quite normal to see errors like that if you don't have Internet access, or if your Internet connection itself is interrupted.\nThe problem may have gone away by itself. If not, you can try a different DNS server (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are good public DNS servers operated by Google), and/or try a different mirror for updating Ubuntu.\n\nA: This has been a long term problem with apt, and Ubuntu has never fixed it.   Apt doesn't seem to use the same DNS servers that the internal system does - 'ping ' returns a correct IP address.  Apt-get claims that the hostname isn't found. \n\"Something wicked happened resolving 'extras.ubuntu.com:http\" (Which sounds, somewhat, like it's trying to resolve a .com:http domain, which isn't a valid TLD) \nTo modify /etc/hosts, use the following:\nPing each of the names that are failing to resolve - \n        PING extras.ubuntu.com (91.189.88.33) 56(84) bytes of data.\nUse your favourite editor, such as vi - 'sudo vi /etc/hosts'.  \nScroll down to the end, and add a line such as the following\n91.189.88.33 extras.ubuntu.com  (with the appropriate name and IP address. IP is first) \n\nSave the file, then re-run apt-get.  Once you've run apt-get, edit /etc/hosts again, and comment out the line with a hash mark - #.   (or delete it entirely)\n#91.189.88.33 extras.ubuntu.com\n\nThe reason to comment out/delete the line is that Ubuntu apparently shuffles their servers around randomly, and that might not be the correct IP the next time. \n\nA: When I got this error, I put the IP address of the Ubuntu mirror in /etc/hosts.  No more error.  (When I queried the mirror in DNS there was never a problem or delay in response, so I'm not sure of the root cause of the error.)\n\nA: That hostname resolves to an Amazon EC2 instance. It's possible there was some transient issue which is now solved as it resolves fine here. Does it now work for you?\n\nA: I got the \"No address associated with hostname\" message with Centos 6.5 when I said yes to IPv6 and apparently the ISP DHCP didn't have it. It solved the problem when I commented out the line in /etc/hosts:\n# ::1     localhost6.localdomain6  localhost6\n\n", "Q: External Hard drive not mounting I have an external hard drive that I transferred a lot of music onto from an old Apple computer. When I plug it into ubuntu it never shows up. \nI tried looking through the filesystem for it but didnt really see or recognize anything. \n\nA: If you copied the files onto the hard drive using Mac OS X, it is possible that the file system is HFS+. Linux doesn't support journaling on HFS+ so Ubuntu will not mount it automatically. Searching the Internet, I see that there are ways of disabling the journaling so that Ubuntu can mount it but I cannot recommend doing this as the solutions appear to me as dangerous hacks. In my opinion the best solution is to find a friend with an Apple computer and copy the files over the network.\nTo check what filesystem the hard drive is, run the following command after plugging it in: \nsudo fdisk -l\n\nA: You could also use a mac with as much free space as you have used on the drive to reformat the drive. That is, move everything onto that mac, use something like Disk Utility to reformat the drive as ext4 or something, and then move everything back onto it. This would be slow and would require 2N space, but would definitely work.\n", "Q: Virtual Machine does not recognize source media to boot. Need help! I just installed the Oracle VM to create a virtual image of Windows XP because I had issues running Yahoo Messenger with Wine. So I decided to try the virtualization instead, but as soon as I installed the virtual machine for XP and started it, for some reason it does not recognize the boot media to start the virtual system installation process.\nI need help, I really love my Ubuntu OS and I don't want to go back to windows, but unfortunately I need to install at least a couple of windows programs that with Ubuntu I haven't able to run the way they should work.\n\nA: If you're not heavily invested in Oracle VM, you should check out Virtual Box OSE, which should be available in the package manager. I use it for running Windows programs, and for testing different versions of Internet Explorer.\nIt's GUI prompts for an ISO or physical disc for installation when you first start a new VM, but, if you're missing that for some reason, you can go to Devices > CD/DVD Devices > More CD/DVD Images... within a virtual machine window to open VB's Virtual Media Manager, then click the Add button to add a new CD/DVD image. Physical discs should be shown at Devices > CD/DVD Devices > (the disk name)\n\nA: To boot Virtual Box with an installation medium we have two options. We can either mount a bootable CD .iso image as a virtual CD drive, or we use the host CD/DVD-drive for booting from a real installation CD. After having set up the basics of a machine such as architecture, prozessor, memory, etc. we go to the Storage settings int the Virtual Box Manager and choose the CD in the IDE Controller -> CD/DVD Drive:\n\nUse the dropdown menu from the CD icon on the right side to add a virtual CD/DVD disk file (which is the bootable .iso CD image mentioned above) or choose the Host Drive  in case you have an installation CD only.\nIn case you already have a virtual hard drive with another bootable OS you may want to change the boot priority in System -> Motherboard settings first:\n\nAfter restarting the machine it will boot the installation medium very much like a real computer does.\n", "Q: Problem for Matlab Installation I install the Matlab2009a to my computer successfully and when I try to activate it without using the internet (Activate manually without the Internet) and provide the path to license file.

I'm trying to install along side windows on an HP Pavillion dv7.\nI've installed ubuntu on other machines, so I know a little about the process.\nIf I remember right, my HD had too many partitions, and I would have to remove one to dual boot properly, so I put it off until now.\nI'm using a live CD now, and I'm on the \"Installation type\" step.\nI don't really understand what I'm looking at.\n\n\nA: Let me try to explain this one.\nProblem: If you already have four primary partitions, then you won't be able to create another partition on your hard disk.\nSolution: Copy all the data from one of your partitions to another and delete that former partition. You can copy it to an external hard disk too. I seriously can't see any workaround for this.\nIn order to delete a partition, launch Gparted and right-click on the drive that you wish to delete. Refer to the figure below:\n \nAfter deleting it proceed with inserting a Live CD and your ubuntu installation.

As for what's the exact difference between a primary and logical partition, I'm afraid I do not know.\n\nA: Your screenshot makes it look like you're creating a custom partition. Assuming that's the case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create two partitions: one more than 7 GB for mounting the root filesystem, and another about 2-3 GB for your swap partition.\n\n*Create the root partition with ext4 filesystem and set the mount point to /.\n\n*And the swap partition as linux-swap.\n\n\nIf you want you can create another partition, around 4-5 GB, for as ext4 and mount /home on it.

I cant ctrl+shift+F1 to a terminal, I can't hold shift during boot to access BIOS. I have tried everything I can think of. Please help!\nMy system:\nXPC shuttle \nUbuntu 12.04\ngraphics card (old) GeForce 6200\ngraphics card (new) Radeon HD 5450\nI also have onboard graphics\nBackground:\nI am trying to upgrade my graphics card from my old nVidia to a newer Radeon. I started by hoping everything would just work and shutting down the system and popping out the old card and sticking in the new one. No luck- the monitor is not detected. So in order to fidget, I have to reinstall the old card to access a terminal. For some reason I can't just use the VGA port for the onboard graphics with a card installed-If I do the monitor is still not detected. If I pull out the card and try to use the onboard graphics, things get weird and Ubuntu doesnt boot properly, although I can get to the BIOS. Also For some reason I can't get ssh to work properly with other computers on my network but i suspect that is a whole other problem. So I reinstall the old card, and remove the proprietary nVidia drivers I was using. Then I install fglrx for the Radeon card. repeat installation process- still no monitor detected. Put the old card back in and remove fglrx (assuming the drivers weren't compatible or something) and try to install with no additional drivers (I reinstalled xorg.conf from apt as well just to be safe). Still no monitor detected. This is a very frustrating problem because in order to fix anything I have to install/remove components. I have taken out and put in this card like 40 times. I would be tempted to assume this is an Ubuntu problem and just erase and install windows, but the fact that I get no monitor at all (and not just a black screen) suggests that a new operating system won't help since the card should be detected before Ubuntu boots (right?)

I will try anything at this point. All my files are already backed up, so I don't have anything to lose. \n\nA: I'm new in Linux. But not new PC technician. Ubuntu I use for two months. What I see, that you have not tried the Live UBUNTU from USB (or DVD). See what happens. If you get into Live Ubuntu, then I guess is somehow bad your installation (I would do fresh install). When you will success with Live Ubuntu with new your Radeon GPU open terminal and enter: lspci | grep VGA. you should get something like that:00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03) - it depends on GPU that use your system. I recently upgraded the one system from old Radeon X800GTO to the new Radeon HD7750.

Here is a list of services provided through Geoclue with the currently included implementations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Position: gpsd, gypsy, hostip, plazes, gsmloc\n\n*Address: hostip, plazes, manual, localnet\n\n*Velocity: gpsd, gypsy\n\n*Geocode: nominatim, geonames, yahoo\n\n*ReverseGeocode: nominatim, geonames\n\n*Geoclue source code contains:\n\n\n*\n\n*D-Bus definitions for the above APIs\n\n*C bindings for Geoclue clients\n\n*C bindings for data providers\n\n*a set of provider implementations\n\n*(experimental) master provider implementation.\n\n\n\n\nApplication ideas (so not actual implementations)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*F-Spot / GThumb: tag photos with location data\n\n*Stars / MaemoStars: show night sky simulation in correct place\n\n*Map applications (MaemoMapper) show correct location on application open\n\n*Jabber / Telepathy: support XEP-0080, add location info to Presence\n\n*Blog software: add geotags to posts\n\n*Yahoo Fire Eagle could use Geoclue as data provider\n\n*Use position/address for desktop settings (timezone, printers, SMTP servers, whatever). Marco Polo looks like a good implementation on OS X\n\n*disable-screensaver-lock-when-at-home\n\n*Find closest free wifi access point\n\n*Tracking application (save location history). Could be used later for tagging photos etc.\n\n*browser, calendar: autofill address form fields (not sure if current location is wanted that often, though?)\n\n*Browser could expose location to websites: Webkit may support Locationaware in the future.\n\n*Google Gears\n\n\n\nPossible data sources\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Geocoding for phone numbers - use countries telephone number dial plans to convert phone numbers to general locations (obviously less accuracy with mobiles and world-wide roaming/etc)\n\n*Google Maps Geocoding API -- License says \"only for showing places on Google Maps\"\n\n*Wigle.net-- WIFI location database (10 million networks). License requires users to login.\n\n*geocoder.us -- geocoder for the USA (TIGER data)\n\n*gsmloc-provider could easily get the GSM information using AT commands on the OpenMoko platform\n\n*A free network location database project has begun at http://geomena.org\n\n\nTurning it off\n\nIf you delete the package it will also delete indicator-datetime. If loosing the date/time applet is not a concern you can go for it.\nOtherwise this seems to work too:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the clock setting to manual;\n\n*Kill /usr/lib/geoclue/geoclue-master\n\n*Kill /usr/lib/ubuntu-geoip/ubuntu-geoip-provider\nThe connection seems to close after killing it.\n\nA: Is it used for tracking?\nNo; GeoClue itself does not contact external services for the reason of providing your location, but rather only provides an API for ubuntu applications to use to find out where you are.\nIf you are in doubt that GeoClue is providing location data to a third party for the purpose of surveillance, you can examine the source code yourself:\ngit clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/geoclue\n\nIMHO, a free (as in freedom) surveillance tool is an impossible realisation.\n\nA: This not tested, but its logic is simple.\n(Still the question is - why we need to dig (more and more) for tricks... Like, how to remove \"mail\" icon/indicator-messages...)\nAdd this to the file /etc/rc.local before last line (i.e., before exit 0):\n# create dump file\necho '#!/bin/sh' > /tmp/my-will\n#echo 'sleep 6000' >> /tmp/my-will; # optional/depends\n#chmod +x /tmp/my-will; # optional/depends\n\n# replace \"bad\" files\nmount -o bind /tmp/my-will /usr/lib/geoclue/geoclue-master\nmount -o bind /tmp/my-will /usr/lib/ubuntu-geoip/ubuntu-geoip-provider\n\n# kill \"bad\" processes\npkill geoclue-master\npkill ubuntu-geoip-provider\n\n\nA: Another simple way to remove those 2 dbus services is to do that:\nsudo mv /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Geoclue.Master.service  /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Geoclue.Master.service_disabled\nsudo mv /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Geoclue.Providers.UbuntuGeoIP.service  /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Geoclue.Providers.UbuntuGeoIP.service_disabled\n\nThen you either kill both services or reboot.\nThe services won't be launched again at subsequent reboots.\nYou have to repeat the same commands if geoclue packages are updated because it will  recreate the original service files.\nIf you need these two dbus services back, do the two mv commands above the other way to restore the original .service files.\n\nA: You can install dconf-tools and navigate to com > ubuntu > geoip and then set the geoip url to something like http://example.com\nor you can set it to a local file containing a permanent xml file so that it remains static.\n", "Q: I've given up on NVIDIA in Ubuntu 64bit 12.04. What graphics cards are stable? I can't handle any more crashes. I have tried many different fixes to the NVIDIA driver problem but none of them work.

Which method is more preferable in which situation ? Which process poses less stress over the cpu ?\n\nA: Encrypting your entire home directory is a fairly comprehensive way to ensure that everything that's unique to you on your system gets encrypted before it's actually written to disk.\nAlternatively, you can just encrypt a single folder.  Anything you save or store in that directory will be encrypted before writing it to disk.  Some people prefer this, but they typically have very specific needs, and know exactly what data they do and do not want to encrypt.\nEncrypting all of home will cause slightly more load on your CPU than just encrypting a single directory.  However, neither of them should cause a terribly noticeable load on your CPU.\nFull disclosure: I'm the author and maintainer of Ubuntu's Encrypted Private, Encrypted Home directory feature and eCryptfs.\n\nA: If you have a private folder , encrypted with encfs, you could make encrypted remote backups of that folder to Ubuntu One.\n", "Q: Does anybody know if Granola does what it says or even if it's safe for Ubuntu? I found a program called Granola, does it do what it says it does or is it even safe or even needed in Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit (It claims to save power by cycling down your system when the extra power isn't needed)? I found it at a website called How to Ubuntu. I'm a little concerned because it's not in the repository, and I couldn't find much 'hard' information about it.\n\nA: *\n\n*It probably does what it says, but there's no need to use it when you can configure Ubuntu to do the same with the built-in tools.\n\n*It's mostly basics like putting your monitor to sleep if the system is idle for so long, putting the system to sleep if idle for so long, spinning down hard drives, reducing CPU frequency, etc.\n\n*Here's a screenshot to give you an idea:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are using a laptop, just closing the lid when you are not using it will save the most power (by default).\n\n*Ubuntu has pretty aggressive power-save settings even for desktops, but you can still tweak it if you'd like to be even more aggressive.\n\n", "Q: notification daemon configuration trouble I am using ubuntu 12.04, and I have somehow got a notification daemon with dumb looking graphics.

I cannot use arrows nor shift-space, nor any key or key combination to go to previous image in gthumb 2.13.1 (Ubuntu Natty Narwhal 11.10). There should be shortcut-keys even to flip horizontally and vertically. And I cannot have a preview box (like before).\nI think that there is no need to do image viewers that are worse and more clumsy to use than previews programs or previous versions of the same program. Hello! What is going on?\n\nA: There are still some key combinations/shortcut-keys available. This is a nice list, but in gThumb 3.0.1 (Ubuntu 12.04) a lot of the shortcut-keys don't work (anymore).

I've createed boot pendrive and installed Ubuntu using option \"Install next to Windows 7\", after installation, when I restarted my computer, there is no system-choosing screen (I suppose it should be GRUB2 there) and Windows 7 starts normally. What's the problem and how to fix it?\n\nA: The problem isn't GRUB2,its Windows MBR Boot loader (NTLDR) That overwrites it.\nThe thing is, if you want to do it with windows 7/8, you'll need to install Ubuntu first,then install windows 7/8.\nOn Windows Vista and XP, it might work but i'm not so sure.\n\nA: You had Win7 installed on your netbook already and then you installed Ubuntu 12.04 from off a pendrive? What I think happened is that Ubuntu was installed OK, but that GRUB was written to the MBR of the pendrive, or to the Ubuntu partition you just installed to. You may have inadvertently selected either option.\nSeeing as you are new to Linux you could consider installing Ubuntu again. No need to delete the existing partition, you can just install Ubuntu over the old partition with the \"Use different option\" option.\nAlternetively you could just boot into a live session from your pendrive and install GRUB2 to the MBR of your internal drive. using:\n$ sudo grub-install /dev/sdx\n\nwhere the x in sdx would be the correct drive letter for your internal drive, usually sda, but double check using:\n$ sudo fdisk -l\n\n", "Q: Error with trying to compile with make.(This also includes a snapshot after doing apt-get update) This is the error I get:\nFetched 120 kB in 1min  1s (1,937 B/s)\nReading package lists...

So I tried to install windows, by creating a partition for it.  \nThere wasn't enough room on the drive so I tried changing the filesystem of my existing partition to support windows.  Now whenever I try to start my computer I get the grub rescue screen.\nI've tried booting from CD and USB with ubuntu and also with windows, but nothing happens. \nI ran ls in grub rescue and got hd0, (hd0,msdos5), cd (with an install disc inserted), fd0, and fd1. However if I run ls on any of these I receive the error: unknown filesystem.  \nCan anyone help me out?\n\nA: When you changed the file-system, GRUB couldn't load into it.\nThere's your problem right there.\nYour going to need to re-install it or find a way to reinitialize the partion with the right file-system without harming the files.\n\nA: Well, if you have Ubuntu lying somewhere on your hard disk, you can re-install GRUB and everything will work fine. Otherwise, GRUB needs its own configuration files and stuff which are by default stored in Ubuntu. So you need to install Ubuntu.\nAnd its not a big problem to install windows after installing Ubuntu. The only thing that will happen is your GRUB will be over written by Windows boot loader and you will directly boot into windows. So in that situation too, what you have to do is to re-install GRUB.\nThe following are the steps to re-install GRUB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot using a live CD of Ubuntu.\n\n*Open a terminal and run the command\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIt lists the complete partition table of the hard disk. In there, identify which partition you have got your linux installed on. You can identify it using the drive size you had allocated for it and looking at the last column of the output which will be ‘extended’ for all of your linux partitions. The partition will most probably be something like /dev/sda5 or something. Remember this partition.\n\n*Create a temporary folder in your home directory (Note: You can make the temporary folder anywhere you want. I’m using the home folder just for the sake of explanation). I’m calling it ‘temp’ for now. So that ‘temp’ folder’s path will be /home/ubuntu/temp.\n\n*Mount your linux partition there. That is, assuming that you found your linux partition to be /dev/sda5, you mount that at the ‘temp’ folder by doing the following command\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /home/ubuntu/temp\n\n\n*If you want to check whether you have mounted the correct partition, go to your home folder and open temp. You will be in the ‘/’ directory. In there you will find ‘home’, in which your home folder’s name will be there. Once you’ve confirmed you have mounted the correct partition, do step 6.\n\n*You have to install grub by showing the system where to read the data from the hard disk at the beginning. Don’t worry, just run the following command\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/home/ubuntu/temp /dev/sda\n\nThe /dev/sda corresponds to your hard disk name. Replace it by whatever the command sudo fdisk -l command showed you.\n\n*You’re done. You may restart your system. \nHope this works for you!\n", "Q: Dell D620 can't detect external monitor when docked Installing 12.04 on Dell D620 laptop (Nvidia Quadro NVS 110M) in a Dell docking station  with Dell 1907FP external monitor.

Plugin only wants wodim I've used cdrtools instead of cdrkit in the past, and has no significant problems getting Brasero to accept cdrtools.  However now it seems Brasero will only look for wodim, it even would not accept a symlink pointing cdrecord -> wodim !!! The same obviously goes for mkisofs -> genisoimage, and readcd -> readom. \nHow can I get Brasero to accept cdrtools? I'm ok with rebuilding the package if nessesary, but not sure where it is specified.  If a ppa already exists for cdrtrools enables brasero, please let me know.  I do not need to be told about Brandon Snider's PPA, I'm already aware how to get cdrtools installed.\nIf anyone has any knowledge on this, any help in the right direction would be most appreciated. \n\nA: How someone did it, from Ubuntu Forums:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=852085\n\nA: https://launchpad.net/~brandonsnider/+archive/cdrtools\nCan not be more simple. Writing with k3b and cdrecord 3 right now as a test. Nothing more than to add this ppa, install and burn.\nI have not tested Brasero though, but this PPA is made for replacing the cdrkit so I assume he though of that too.\nOh, it was mentioned already :)\n\nA: I'm still trying to wrap my head around all the issues but I think I know why your having problems. I have also been struggling with the switch to cdrtools and mkisofs. As far as Brasero 3.4.1 is concerned (I assume you have a similar version) there is a directory /usr/lib/brasero3-1/plugins which seems to be the basis for how Brasero is configured. This directory contains a file called wodim.so, which is a binary. \nI'm afraid I have no idea how to change this. Even more annoying is the fact that the xcdroast which is available in the repositories also insists on having wodim.\nMy suggestion is to use cdrtools on the command line. I'm avoiding wodim because I have had significant problems with it including (but not restricted to) wasting a large number of blank CDs because it simply did not work with Brasero... \"An error occurred\" \nSorry, I can't give you better advice at this stage.\n\nA: The PPA now has a resolution to the crafty Brasero checks in place to make sure you're really using Wodim, Readom, and Genisoimage. There are scripts I developed with Jorg Schilling and Clement Lefebvre to act as middle-men -- fooling Brasero into thinking it's actually using Kit, when it's really using Tools. All features of the Kit plugins are enabled at that point.\nPlugins for mkisofs, cdrecord, and readcd are available in Brasero, but they go unbuilt. A different solution would be to rebuild Brasero locally and enable the Tools plugins, installing them in a separate package called \"brasero-cdrtools\". That's undoubtedly beyond most users.\n", "Q: Modinfo, /etc/modules and lsmod: incoherent output?

The other certain i2c real time clocks.\nThe config file for each built Ubuntu kernel is placed into /boot along with the headers and the kernel image itself so you can see how it was set up.\nBuilt in drivers don't show up in lsmod, for example.\nAt one time there was a driver simply named rtc, but not now.

This is not a question about how to create a home partition, just as a caveat. :)\nWhat are the pros and cons to having a separate home partition? How do I know if having one is right for me? Will it increase or decrease speed of file retrieval? Are there any risks?\n\nA: *\n\n*The biggest pro, in my opinion, is that you can easily install a newer Ubuntu version (or any Linux distro for your architecture, really), without losing most of your custom settings, configurations, downloads, etc., since such a step usually involves wiping out the existing system/boot partitions. You simply choose to preserve your /home in the partitioner during install, and you're set. It is also possible to do this with /home on your / partition, but is a little more complicated.\n\n*It also makes resizing/migrating to a larger home partition easier, if you ever need more space.\n\n*It isn't going to affect the speed of file access much, UNLESS you tend to have lots and lots of small files in your home directory. e.g., if you are a developer, or you have lots of sources lying around. That MAY affect overall file access speed on the entire partition with some filesystems. In that case, go for a separate /home.\n\n*There aren't any risks to making a separate home partition.\n\nBottom-line: In your place, I wouldn't go for a separate home partition unless I had a second physical drive I wanted to use for it. But if you're not very familiar with Linux or the command-line, and you intend to try out different Linux distributions, a separate /home is recommended.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you have an SSD or a faster hard disk that you want to dedicate to\n/home, which will improve speed for some things.\n\n*If you write lots of data to your home partition, but you don't really install too many packages. For example, if all you do on that box is video editing and all of your projects are in /home.\n\n\nA: It won't speed up file access much, unless the partition the /home is on a faster device.  It does allow for separate buffering though, so I guess there would be a minor speed increase from that under the right conditions.\nMainly though, it makes your file system more rugged.  Filling up the /home partition does not result in the main filesystem crashing or being unable to update.  You can also re-install at any time, and by selecting the advanced mode (partitioner) in Ubiquity you can specify the /home partition without formatting it.  This speeds up the installation and leaves your data intact, even if you wish to format the / partition at that time.\nA separate /home can also make data retrieval easier in the case of a crash.  If you suffer from a failed release upgrade for example, the /home partition will be untouched and you can easily recover by installing or re-commencing the upgrade without being too concerned about your data.  On one of my machines /home is on a separate drive, physically insulating the data from problems on the first hard drive.\nHaving a separate /home partition does NOT negate the necessity to do proper backups of your important data however.  You should never entrust your most important files to just one drive or partition.\nThere are no problems with having a separate /home, as long as the person administering the system has the ability to understand and set up subsequent releases correctly.\nSince Ubuntu itself requires less than 4GB, efficiently sizing the / partition is the key to success.  Generally 15-20GB is more than enough for the / partition no matter you want to do, however if you want to install large database programs (oracle) setup large servers, or doing anything else that the normal desktop user will not do, then you need to understand the requirements for the system you are trying to build before proceeding.\nI like to have two / partitions.  Subsequent releases can then be put on the next partition, allowing me a complete fallback to the previous release in the event of problems.  This has stood me in good stead recently, when problems were encountered configuring shares in the LAN. The previous release could be booted while the problems were sorted out, minimising disruption for people using these shares.  Two 15-20GB partitions do not take up much space on modern hard drives.\n\nA: The main disadvantage I can see if you have a separate /home partition is that space is not optimized.\nFor example, you may not have enough space to install new software in /usr or you may not have enough space to add new data to the /home partition.\nSo the advantage of not using a separate /home partition is that you are only limited by the size of the whole drive and not the size of your partitions.\n", "Q: Streaming Radio I can stream Radio Paradise in Audacious but not in Banshee.

In there, identify which partition you have got your linux installed on.

Remember this partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a temporary folder in your home directory (Note: You can make the temporary folder anywhere you want. I’m using the home folder just for the sake of explanation). I’m calling it ‘temp’ for now. So that ‘temp’ folder’s path will be /home/ubuntu/temp.\n\n*Mount your linux partition there. That is, assuming that you found your linux partition to be /dev/sda5, you mount that at the ‘temp’ folder by doing the following command\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /home/ubuntu/temp\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to check whether you have mounted the correct partition, go to your home folder and open temp.

On subject machine I may have neglected to complete the 11.10 updates before running the upgrade to 12.04.  \nThe questions please are how can I back out of this upgrade to Wubi, since with no network connection one may not do over the wire repairs?  Or lacking that back out, might one repair this from an ISO file of 12.04? Or lacking all, how may one back out of the Wubi altogether and go back to the Win7 only boot, since the 12.04 ISO file is running well as a boot under VM Virtual Box under the Win7?  \n\nA: I don't think the online upgrade is guaranteed to work in a Wubi install.  I seem to recall that it does not get thoroughly tested during beta testing.  A failure in the on-line upgrade can result in the data on the Wubi install being inaccessible.\nYou could boot off the LiveDVD of 12.04 (or other) and mount the wubi virtual drive to get your data off it.  You should then remove the wubi install from Windows and re-install 12.04, then put your data back on /home.\nYou could also consider a dual boot installation of Ubuntu.  Before setting up a dual boot system I recommend that you defrag and check your Windows file system as it can speed up the install (re-partitioning) immensely and greatly reduce the chance of problems.  You really should back up all your data before you do any of this.  If you want to backup the wubi virtual disk before proceeding, you will find it at \nd:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk\nChris\n\nA: As long as VirtualBox is working well enough for you, I would recommend uninstalling Wubi. \nAccording to the WubiGuide, you should just be able to uninstall Wubi as you would any other Windows application. You can also uninstall by running C:\\ubuntu\\Uninstall-Ubuntu.exe.\nDo not forget to save any data of value to you from your Wubi install before you remove it.\n", "Q: Help with BURG on 12.04 Can anyone tell me if this article for BURG Boot-loader is correct? I'm sure it is due to the fact that I have never had a problem with the site before. But I am always weary of things made for older versions of Ubuntu. \nKeep in mind I have 12.04 not 11.04. Could the same be applied for 12.04 or are they completely different. If so, could you give me a step by step guide of what to do in order to get BURG up and running on my 12.04 computer? \nIt also says to be completely sure of what I'm doing and how to reverse it. I know that I'm messing with my boot-loader, meaning, if I mess up, I would have basically no way of booting any operating system and would have to install Ubuntu all over again in order to get back to the original boot-loader. (Or, at least, that is what happened before (not when trying to change loaders, just when I accidentally turned off my computer while Ubuntu was in start-up.) But, I do not know any way to reverse the process if something were to go wrong.\nI dual-boot with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 only, side-by-side. \nMy Ubuntu partition is named /dev/sda4, and (according to GParted,) contains /dev/sda6 (file system: ext4) and /dev/sda4 (file system: linux-swap). My Windows 7 partition is /dev/sda3. This information was given so you don't have to say \"replace \"blah\" with your hard drive name,\" or anything like that. I do not want to mess anything up.\nEven if it is all correct for Ubuntu 12.04, I'd like you to rewrite it so any simpleton anywhere knows exactly what to do. (No definitions needed.) Please and Thank you.\n\nA: The tut on the link you provided looks fine. If you mess up the boot loader you do NOT need to do a full install again. You can reinstall grub using a live CD or something like Super GRUB Disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:n-muench/burg\n\n*ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install burg burg-themes grub-customizer\n\n*sudo burg-install \"(hd0)\" \n[Or (sda)]\n\n*sudo burg-emu\n(to test it out)\n\n\nA: What I can tell is that the burg package from ppa:n-muench/burg still works in 12.04.\nI had Ubuntu 11.04 with burg installed and working, and I recently went through the (somewhat painful) upgrade to 12.04. \nAlthough the upgrade installed and configured the latest grub, after a simple 'burg-upgrade' operation I was able to get burg back to work, including also the saved theme.\n", "Q: How to fix syslinux error creating a bootable USB stick in Windows? I downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 desktop and I am trying to create a bootable USB drive using the universal USB installer. \nHowever, I keep getting the message:\nAn error(1) occurred while executing syslinux. Your USB drive won’t be bootable.\n\nI have formatted the USB using FAT32 (both quick and complete format) and even tried only FAT. The error still appears. I have also turned off all firewall but it does not make a difference. \nWhy is this happening?\n\nA: I've had the same problem with Ubuntu 12.04 desktop 64bits. I tried 2 times, same error: Syslinux shows a warning, closes and say \"Won't be bootable\". \nSo, I formatted the USB stick BEFORE opening universal USB installer, and NOT checked the \"format drive\" option (checkbox) and it worked just fine.\n\nA: Download Unetbootin for Windows and try that:\nhttp://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\nBefore going ahead and making the Bootable USB, it's always a good idea to check the md5sum of the iso that you downloaded:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM#MD5SUM_on_Windows\nThis can save you a lot of grief later if it turns out the download was corrupt\nChris\nEdit: @emersonhsieh, I think the LiveUSB must be formatted FAT to be able to boot off it.\n@ Chris Mine had fat32 but it didn't work.  after I reformatted it to ntfs it didn't have the error message.\n@eversonhsieh:  I have come across situations where the partition table put on the USB stick by the manufacturer causes some problems.  The solution is to delete the partition table completely, remake it, and re-format FAT.\nChris\nI'm adding this as another edit, because my comment below seems to get hidden by a \"show more\" link.  I think it's important enough to put it here in clear as it's caused a problem for quite a few people, myself included:\nOk, I've just verified this problem with Unetbootin and Ubuntu Startup disk creator on a Verbatim 2Gb drive. The problem is the partition table that the manufacturers put on the devices. Perhaps it's not marked bootable, or has something non-standard in there. The solution is to remove the partition table on the device, and remake a new partition table. You can then create a new partition and format it FAT32 and it will work. Chris\n\nA: I also used the universal usb installer, and also got that problem.\nTry reformat the drive to NTFS and try again.  It should work.\n\nA: I resolved this problem. I tried format stick from FAT32 to NTFS - without results. I tried to format stick BEFORE running the Installer - without results. Then I did SLOW, LONG format of my USB stick using the system's Windows format (right click of mouse on the icon of USB stick and not-marked \"Fast format\"). Good luck ! :-)\n\nA: Here's my experience after following some of the top rated answers on this thread.\n\n\n*\n\n*Formatting with NTFS using Windows built in format utility got rid of syslinux error but I could never boot from the pendrive. \n\n*Formatting with exFAT be it quick or thorough didnt solve the problem and syslinux error persisted.\n\n*Universal USB Installer has a setting to format fat32 as highlighted in the image:\n\nThis setting worked perfectly fine, the pen drive was formatted by this tool, installer was copied and I could boot from the pen drive.\n\nA: Disable Windows Ransomware Protection\nWindows Ransomware Protection was preventing syslinx from working correctly. Actually, it displayed a pop-up notification indicating that it was prevented from working.\nAfter disabling Windows Ransomware Protection, I was able to write an Ubuntu image.\nHow to Disable Windows Ransomware Protection?\nStart ➜ (type) Settings ➜ Windows Security ➜ Virus & threat protection ➜ Ransomware protection ➜ Manage ransomware protection ➜ Controlled folder access ➜ set OFF\nThis can be reenabled after the USB image creation\n\nA: FAT32 has a maximum partition size of 32GB. If you're using a newer flash drive, it's likely greater than 32GB - so you will have problems.\nDelete all the partitions and the volume, then create a new volume that is 32GB or less in size.\nNow the ISO -> USB program can re-format as FAT32 successfully.\n\nA: I was having the same problem of \"SYSLINX ERROR\"\nFormat your pendrive using NTFS format and then load your ios (Note: Again Don't format pendriver with bootable software ok it will not work if you format it again with bootable software).\nit will work fine.\n\nA: My experience is to make sure no GPT used in boot as mentioned in the requirements of the UUI.\ne.g., re-run rufus to make sure MBR boot is used.\n", "Q: Problem renaming wireless interfaces I want to rename a wireless interface.

In there, identify which partition you have got your linux installed on. You can identify it using the drive size you had allocated for it and looking at the last column of the output which will be ‘extended’ for all of your linux partitions. The partition will most probably be something like /dev/sda5 or something. Remember this partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a temporary folder in your home directory (Note: You can make the temporary folder anywhere you want. I’m using the home folder just for the sake of explanation). I’m calling it ‘temp’ for now. So that ‘temp’ folder’s path will be /home/ubuntu/temp.\n\n*Mount your linux partition there. That is, assuming that you found your linux partition to be /dev/sda5, you mount that at the ‘temp’ folder by doing the following command\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /home/ubuntu/temp\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to check whether you have mounted the correct partition, go to your home folder and open temp. You will be in the ‘/’ directory. In there you will find ‘home’, in which your home folder’s name will be there. Once you’ve confirmed you have mounted the correct partition, do step 6.\n\n*You have to install grub by showing the system where to read the data from the hard disk at the beginning. Don’t worry, just run the following command\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/home/ubuntu/temp /dev/sda\nThe ‘/dev/sda’ corresponds to your hard disk name. Replace it by whatever the command ‘sudo fdisk -l’ command showed you.\n\n\n*\n\n*You’re done.

I am about to download and load Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit to my usb with the pen drive linux software. \nI have a dell 570 desktop 64 bit. I have bought a separate and physical hard drive for my new operating operating system,... the hard drive is a SATA 500, Western Caviar Blue. \nIf anyone have any tips, I would really appreciate the help. I have been doing this one task for four days, but was not possible of getting it done. I have came up with grub missing files, it wouldn't read the old/new external hard drive. Even thought it noticed and was installed to it. Using the \" / \" ,  \" swap \". \nIf anyone can give me some feed back of help. So that it can be a good installation from top to bottom. And just to clarify I did make my own live cd with the Ubuntu. Plus does anyone know what is up with Grub 1 and grub 2. \nFrom Ronnie D. Marlow.\n\nA: I could install 12.04 64-bit with no issues whatsoever.\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, there are 3 disk devices during installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*internal disk\n\n*pendrive (the ubuntu installer)\n\n*external disk\n\n\nI'm wondering if the order in which the disks are detected and assigned to device files in /dev/sdX can be a problem here. For example if during the installation the above devices are assigned respectively to /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, then that might be a problem when you try to reboot with the pendrive removed, as in that case the external disk will be /dev/sdb instead of /dev/sdc. \nSince I don't know grub2 in detail, this hypothesis can be completely wrong, but I would try to fiddle with the disk order:\n\n\n*\n\n*After installation, try to boot with the pendrive plugged in.\n\n*After installation, try to boot with the pendrive removed.\n\n*Instead of installing from pendrive, try to install from a cd.\n\n\nAs per your grub question, this should explain:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2\n\nA: While I can relate to your desire to getting the most optimal OS for your computer,I have to ask: Do you NEED the 64-bit version of Ubuntu?\nAs far as I know (feel free to correct), the improvements of 64-bit over 32-bit are only needed for special use purposes, for example if you are doing some very precise scientific calculations on your machine and you need the performance improvements.\nYou'll notice that when you download the 12.04 image on the Ubuntu website, it says that the 32-bit version is recommended. So, give it a try and see if that fixes any of your problems. From general experience (again please shoot me down if I am wrong), software is more geared towards 32-bit and you'll get less bugs. Especially when the release is relatively new. \nAlso, simply to clarify, how many hard drives are you using? There's the one inside your machine and there's also an external drive (the SATA 500)? Are you replacing the old one with the new one? And what you're saying is that the mount point (/) and the swap partition for your Ubuntu install are on the external drive...?\nI need more details to be able to help.\n", "Q: How can I make the Indicator backgrounds transparent in the gnome-panel? I've searched everywhere to solve this problem and cannot for the life of me find an answer.\nI am currently using Ubuntu 12.04 with the Gnome classic session. I am trying to make the background of my panel transparent and every tricky I try fails with the indicator backgrounds. Is there a way to do this? Thanks! \n\nA: I'm sorry if I'm answering this incorrectly, but I assume you mean your taskbar at the top of your screen or the panel in your SuperKey.\nIf you want to do that, you'll want to get a theme for Gnome. In order to get a theme for Gnome, you'll have to download one here, or just look around yourself. Gnome themes change everything in your desktop except Window edges and GTK, so everything will fit in.\nIn order to apply Gnome Shell Themes, follow the instructions here. \nIf you just wanted to change the transparency of that bar alone, I don't know what to tell you, that's probably out of my pay-grade. You can do it with Unity by downloading MyUnity, which is available through the Software Center, though, and just going through the settings of it. If you try it with MyUnity, the settings might transfer over to Gnome, but there are no guarantees. \nI'm sorry I could not help more, but I am considered a new user and may only use two Hyperlinks when answering questions. I'm sure a quick Google of \"Gnome Shell Themes\" will direct you to the right place. If you want to know a transparent theme, one is called Nord. I would have posted pics, but I'm not allowed to do that either. \n\nA: Not really sure here, but probably Compiz Config Settings Manager may help you; \nIf I'm not mistaken it should work as an equivalent to Gnome Classic of MyUnity.\n", "Q: How to resize a window when the bottom right is not visible?

This way you will be directed to the location where we want to make the required changes. This is the section of the file we will be editing:\nYou will see that the file noise-texture.png specifies the default image that Ubuntu uses as the lock and login screen background.\nYou need to replace the lines with the following ones:\n#lockDialogGroup {\nbackground: #2c001e url(file:///[fileLocation/filename.png]);\nbackground-repeat: no-repeat;\nbackground-size: cover;\nbackground-position: center;\n}\n\nSave this file by clicking the Save button located at the top right corner of the text editor.\nRestart your computer for these changes to take effect.\nNow when you log in to your system, you will be able to see the newly set up background instead of the default Ubuntu login image. \nSo, as you have seen, changing the login background is not as difficult as it seems. You simply need to edit the ubuntu.css file and restart the computer in order to make this supposedly technical customization.\n", "Q: How can I repair Unity after trying to install macOS theme from noobslab?

Last night I successfully installed Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, and then I tried to install Mac OSX Theme following this noobslab article.\nBut after I installed the last thing, GNOME Tweak Tool, I ran compiz and my Ubuntu bar disappeared, then the system froze, so I restarted, and now all I see is wallpaper; no icons, no bar. \nNow I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 Live CD. It's all I can use, live CD.\nAnd one other thing, I have Windows 7 64-bit, and it's full of spyware and trojans.

The same applies to setting LC_MESSSAGES and LANG. Specifying an invalid / non-installed locale name causes fallback to the POSIX locale and therefore US English.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] The reasons that Lekensteyn's answer works even _without_ unsetting / overriding `LANGUAGE` is an _exception_: if the (effective) `LC_MESSAGES` value (typically set indirectly via `LANG` or `LC_ALL`) is either `C` or (its synonym) `POSIX`, that value is respected, irrespective of the value of `LANGUAGE`, if any. Conversely, if the (effective) `LC_MESSAGES` value is any other, _specific_ locale, `LANGUAGE` takes precedence.\n\n\n[2] This applies to [Ubuntu proper](https://www.ubuntu.com/), but not necessarily to [other flavors](https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/flavours); Lekensteyn states that [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) does _not_ set `LANGUAGE`.  \nArguably, `LANGUAGE` should _not_ be set by default, given that in its absence the `LC_MESSAGES` value implied by the `LANG` value (which determines the current locale), is respected.\n\n\n[3] You can also use this approach to switch to [US] English by assigning either `LANGUAGE=C` or `LANGUAGE=POSIX` (as an alternative to, `LANG=C` / `LANG=POSIX`), though I'm unclear whether that is actively recognized or simply a _fallback_ mechanism, given that these values don't start with a _language_ tag; perhaps the better choice would be `en_US`.\n\n\n[4] There's an _edge_ case where this approach doesn't work: Trying to invoke an executable with a _path_ - whether relative or absolute - does NOT switch to the specified language, whereas a _mere filename_ does:  \n`LANGUAGE= LC_ALL=es_ES.UTF-8 /path/to/no_such_utility` does _not_ work (outputs a message in the current locale), whereas  \n`LANGUAGE= LC_ALL=es_ES.UTF-8 no_such_utility` does (outputs a Spanish error message).  \nIf anyone knows why and whether there's a good reason for this, do let us know.\n\n", "Q: Which debconf preseed option to install GRUB automatically to MBR?

I'm currently running Ubuntu 12.04 and want to completely format my laptop so I can install Windows 7 (replace Ubuntu). \nWhen I put in my bootable USB with the OS it just shows a black screen with a white blinking cursor on the top left corner. I wait for hours (to be specific 5 whole hours) waiting for something to happen but I get nothing, so I pull out the USB and my Ubuntu 12.04 loads up.\nRepeated this several times with putting different boot priority options on top-est that relate to USB but the results are same. I go and visit some sites on the net like this http://www.techspot.com/community/topics/cant-replace-ubuntu-with-windows.175716/ that say I have to zero out my hard drive. \nMy question is how?\nNote: Erasing out all my data is no problem cause I have nothing important to backup.\nIf I have to lose my primary OS (Ubuntu 12.04) in the process I am ready to as my aim is just to install Windows 7 successfully. Please don't answer that there is something wrong with my USB or my USB reader/port/hardware or the content inside the USB cause they all works fine on my brothers PC as it boots up flawlessly.\n\nA: Zero-out drive on Linux is done via:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX\n\nwhere sdX is the device of the drive to delete.\nIf you're not aware on how to do this, press Ctrl+Alt+T from Ubuntu, and type following:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb\n\nIn example above, sdb is the second connected drive.\nNB! This will erase your drive completely. Use at your own risk.\n\nEDIT 1:\nOptionally, you might want to add status=progress to show progress status:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb status=progress\n\n\nEDIT 2:\nAs per comments below, setting the buffer size might significantly speed up the process:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=16M\n\nPlease note, however, with a buffer dd will not wait until operation is complete, so afterwards you might need to execute sync command, which synchronizes data on disk with memory.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=16M && sync\n\nWhat's the purpose of sync? Simple: in case if your storage is slow and power off happens right after dd while disk data is not synchronized, some of the data might be lost. It might be not so relevant for this particular case about zeroing out the drive on PC, but for things like embedded systems with slow flash memories this needs to be considered.\n\nA: You can use pv to do it and you'll even get a nice progress bar:\npv < /dev/zero > /dev/sdX\n\nwhere sdX is the device of the drive to delete; you can get that from this command:\nlsblk\n\nTaken from pv(1)\n\nA: Another tool that can do the job is shred:\nshred -v -f -n1 --random-source=/dev/zero /dev/sda2\n\n\nA: Maybe I can add a little insight here. When booting with a Windows CD, the Windows installer program is kind of stupid and worthless as most Microsoft products are. What can end up happening is the operating system of the Windows installer CD will hand and die. Mostly because it doesn't know what to do with a hard drive that is not zero'd, or doesn't have Windows. It doesn't give an error, just hangs.\nI happen to have a perfect example right in front of me right now. Even when I boot with an Ubuntu CD, on this ASUS computer, the OS, begins to start, then it touches the hard drive, as any good OS should do, in order to see what resources are present.\nOn this particular computer, (and the problem is with the BIOS of the particular machine) it appears to hang, for almost 20 minutes, for each touch of the hard drive. So booting a live CD on this computer can take almost 20 minutes. Just in case, I'd check for a BIOS upgrade on your system, it will prolly fix the USB booting issues and maybe the timeout routine for no hard drive access, although that's more unlikely.\nIf you can boot from the live CD, just let it sit. Shouldn't take more than an hour, if you have the same booting flaw as this machine. Once it comes up, do the HD zero out,  in a pinch though, boot with your Ubuntu on HD, and zero it out anyhow. It should zero out enough before the OS crashes to allow your worthless Windows install CD to work.\n", "Q: Does pulseaudio have an error log?

If set to auto (which is the default),\n          then logging is directed to syslog when --daemonize  is  passed,\n          otherwise to STDERR.\n\nSo, to answer your question.  No, by default it does not have a log, it sends its log output to syslog as a daemon (when its running in the background), or to STDERR when its run in the terminal (aka, you see the output in the terminal.\nYou have three options (potentially) to get the log information you need in one nice package:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use it in the terminal\n\n*See (and upvote :P) the other answer for a good trick for filtering out the pulseaudio output from syslog.\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*Trying changing the --log-target= to a new log file (located in /var/log/ I'm assuming.

I haven't tested this so I don't know if it will work.\nAfter disabling autospawn kill the daemon with pulseaudio --kill and start it again pulseaudio (with any options you want to pass).  Hope this works!\n\nA: I've been able to find some output from Pulse Audio in syslog. I don't think Pulse Audio has some seperate log file.

Pick whatever you feel comfortable using.\n\n\n*Click the Back key when your done. Please note changes above should change instantly.\n\n\nThe main reason I did this too, was because I like freeing up my Super key to be able to do other shortcuts. For example Super+T = Terminal, Super+g = Gedit, Super+c = Chrome, Super+PrtScn = grab section of the screen (for taking screenshots). If you want to set something like this... then the section is called \"General\" and the button to press is \"Commands\".

The data is read synchronously and it takes about 10 seconds to finish the read operation, during which time the loading of the UI is delayed.\nI'd like to run the task asynchronously, and get a notification when it's ready, without blocking the UI, more or less like:\ndef take_ages():\n    read_a_huge_file_from_disk()\n\ndef on_finished_long_task():\n    print \"Finished!\"\n\nrun_long_task(task=take_ages, callback=on_finished_long_task)\nload_the_UI_without_blocking_on_long_task()\n\nI've used GTask in the past for this sort of thing, but I'm concerned that its code hasn't been touched in 3 years, let alone been ported to GObject Introspection. Most importantly, it's no longer available in Ubuntu 12.04. So I'm looking for an easy way to run tasks asynchronously, either in a standard Python way or in a GObject/GTK+ standard way.\nEdit: here's some code with an example of what I'm trying to do. I've tried python-defer as suggested in the comments, but I could not manage to run the long task asynchronously and let the UI load without having to wait for it to finish. Browse the test code. \nIs there an easy and widely used way of running asynchronous tasks and get notified when they're finished?\n\nA: Use the introspected Gio API to read a file, with its asynchronous methods, and when making the initial call, do it as a timeout with GLib.timeout_add_seconds(3, call_the_gio_stuff) where call_the_gio_stuff is a function which returns False.\nThe timeout here is necessary to add (a different number of seconds may be required, though), because while the Gio async calls are asynchronous, they are not non-blocking, meaning that the heavy disk activity of reading a large file, or large number of files, can result in blocked UI, as the UI and I/O are still in the same (main) thread.\nIf you want to write your own functions to be async, and integrate with the main loop, using Python's file I/O APIs, you'll have to write the code as a GObject, or to pass callbacks around, or use python-defer to help you do it. But it's best to use Gio here, as it can bring you a lot of nice features, especially if you're doing file open/save stuff in the UX.\n\nA: You can also use GLib.idle_add(callback) to call the long running task once the GLib Mainloop finishes all it's higher priority events (which I believe includes building the UI).\n\nA: Your problem is a very common one, therefore there are tons of solutions (sheds, queues with multiprocessing or threading, worker pools, ...) \nSince it is so common, there is also a python build-in solution (in 3.2, but backported here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures) called concurrent.futures. 'Futures' are available in many languages, therefore python calls them the same. Here are the typical calls (and here is your full example, however, the db part is replaced by sleep, see below why). \nfrom concurrent import futures\nexecutor = futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)\n#executor = futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)\nfuture = executor.submit(slow_load)\nfuture.add_done_callback(self.on_complete)\n\nNow to your problem, which is much more complicated than your simple example suggests. In general you have threads or processes to solve this, but here is why your example is so complicated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most Python implementations have a GIL, which makes threads not fully utilize multicores. So: do not use threads with python!\n\n*The objects you want to return in slow_load from the DB are not pickelable, which means that they can not simply be passed between processes. So: no multiprocessing with softwarecenter results!\n\n*The library you call (softwarecenter.db) is not threadsafe (seems to include gtk or similar), therefore calling these methods in a thread results in strange behaviour (in my test, everything from 'it works' over 'core dump' to simple quitting without results). So: no threads with softwarecenter.\n\n*Every asynchronous callback in gtk should not do anything except sheduling a callback which will be called in the glib mainloop. So: no print, no gtk state changes, except adding a callback!\n\n*Gtk and alike does not work with threads out of the box. You need to do threads_init, and if you call a gtk or alike method, you have to protect that method (in earlier versions this was gtk.gdk.threads_enter(), gtk.gdk.threads_leave(). see for example gstreamer:  http://pygstdocs.berlios.de/pygst-tutorial/playbin.html).\n\n\nI can give you the following suggestion: \n\n\n*\n\n*Rewrite your slow_load to return pickelable results and use futures with processes. \n\n*Switch from softwarecenter to python-apt or similar (you probably don't like that). But since your employed by Canonical, you could ask the softwarecenter developers directly to add documention to their software (e.g. stating that it is not thread safe) and even better, making softwarecenter threadsafe.\n\n\nAs a note: the solutions given by the others (Gio.io_scheduler_push_job, async_call) do work with time.sleep but not with softwarecenter.db. This is, because it all boils down to threads or processes and threads to not work with gtk and softwarecenter.\n\nA: Here's another option using GIO's I/O Scheduler (I've never used it before from Python, but the example below seems to run fine).\nfrom gi.repository import GLib, Gio, GObject\nimport time\n\ndef slow_stuff(job, cancellable, user_data):\n    print \"Slow!\"\n    for i in xrange(5):\n        print \"doing slow stuff...\"\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n    print \"finished doing slow stuff!\"\n    return False # job completed\n\ndef main():\n    GObject.threads_init()\n    print \"Starting...\"\n    Gio.io_scheduler_push_job(slow_stuff, None, GLib.PRIORITY_DEFAULT, None)\n    print \"It's running async...\"\n    GLib.idle_add(ui_stuff)\n    GLib.MainLoop().run()\n\ndef ui_stuff():\n    print \"This is the UI doing stuff...\"\n    time.sleep(1)\n    return True\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n\nA: I think it bears noting that this is a convoluted way to do what @mhall suggested.\nEssentially, you've got a run this then run that function of async_call.\nIf you want to see how it works, you can play with the sleep timer and keep clicking the button.  It's essentially the same as @mhall's answer except that there's example code.\nBased on this which is not my work.\nimport threading\nimport time\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, GObject\n\n\n\n# calls f on another thread\ndef async_call(f, on_done):\n    if not on_done:\n        on_done = lambda r, e: None\n\n    def do_call():\n        result = None\n        error = None\n\n        try:\n            result = f()\n        except Exception, err:\n            error = err\n\n        GObject.idle_add(lambda: on_done(result, error))\n    thread = threading.Thread(target = do_call)\n    thread.start()\n\nclass SlowLoad(Gtk.Window):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        Gtk.Window.__init__(self, title=\"Hello World\")\n        GObject.threads_init()        \n\n        self.connect(\"delete-event\", Gtk.main_quit)\n\n        self.button = Gtk.Button(label=\"Click Here\")\n        self.button.connect(\"clicked\", self.on_button_clicked)\n        self.add(self.button)\n\n        self.file_contents = 'Slow load pending'\n\n        async_call(self.slow_load, self.slow_complete)\n\n    def on_button_clicked(self, widget):\n        print self.file_contents\n\n    def slow_complete(self, results, errors):\n        '''\n        '''\n        self.file_contents = results\n        self.button.set_label(self.file_contents)\n        self.button.show_all()\n\n    def slow_load(self):\n        '''\n        '''\n        time.sleep(5)\n        self.file_contents = \"Slow load in progress...\"\n        time.sleep(5)\n        return 'Slow load complete'\n\n\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    win = SlowLoad()\n    win.show_all()\n    #time.sleep(10)\n    Gtk.main()\n    \n\nAdditional note, you have to let the other thread finish before it will terminate properly or check for a file.lock in your child thread.\nEdit to address comment:\nInitially I forgot GObject.threads_init().  Evidently when the button fired, it initialized threading for me.  This masked the mistake for me.\nGenerally the flow is create the window in memory, immediately launch the other thread, when the thread completes update the button.  I added an additional sleep before I even called Gtk.main to verify that the full update COULD run before the window was even drawn.  I also commented it out to verify that the thread launch doesn't impede window drawing at all.\n", "Q: How to make a password protected folder without any software I would like to make a private folder.\n\nso how can I password protected folder without any additional software?\n\n\nA: If by \"no additional software\" you mean using the filesystem tools alone, then the answer is: you can't.\nHowever, you can easily create a private directory accessible to your non-privileged user only. All you need for this is restrict access for all other users. You can use the means of your graphical file manager, or you can do it from the command line:\nchmod -v 700 /path/to/your/directory\n\nAfter this, the content of your directory will be visible only to your non-privileged user (and root, of course).\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Can I get any logging and error output from Flash?

Where is the boot loader, such as Grub, installed generally? \nWhen I install 12.04 along side Windows on different partitions of my disk, I encountered a choice for \"Device for boot loader installation\". If I understand it correctly, it is to specify where to install the boot loader Grub,\nI found on the internet that it is to specify the disk that contains the partitions for the OS, not any partition on the disk. E.g.\ndisk sda, not partition sda1, sda2.\nQuestions:\nI wonder where the boot loader installed actually on the disk?\nIs it installed on any of the existing partitions for the OSes and for personal data, or does it have its own partition, which is also visible e.g. from system monitor of Ubuntu?\nThanks and regards!\n\nA: It's exactly where you chose to install it when you installed Ubuntu. ubiquity prompts you for this information during installation. See below:\n\nIf you are running a legacy system (BIOS) this will typically be the Master Boot Record of the drive you choose or the unusual choice of the Partition Boot Record of the partition you chose to install it on. If you are running a system with a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface the grub bootloader will be installed in the ESP.\nSources:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface\nhttps://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/installation.html#accessing\nExperience\n\nA: I spent an hour trying to find the configuration of where GRUB is installed in Debian, because it's not stored in GRUB's own configuration files.\nIt turns out it's handled by debconf:\ndebconf-show grub-pc\nand look for \"grub-pc/install_devices\".\n\nA: The boot loader needs to be installed where the BIOS is looking for something to boot. To keep things simple, you usually have a disk drive where your computer boots from, you install a GNU/Linux system in that disk and the bootloader gets there too.\nThe only things you need from the bootloader are really:\n\n\n*\n\n*That the BIOS is able to find it\n\n*That it is able to find and boot your Operating System (with Linux, you just need the bootloader to have somehow access to the kernel and, if you're using one, the initrd image.)\n\n\nAs far as you have these two points covered, you install it where it is more convenient and where the BIOS will look for it.\nThe BIOS will usually look for bootloaders in the Master Boot Record of hard drives, a small area in the beginning of the drive where you can put some code to be run. You can also have a bootloader installed at the beginning of a partition. \nBootloaders are usually small enough to fit in these small areas, and even if they don't, they must put something there so the BIOS boots the bootloader.\nlilo is a simple bootloader which is installed in those areas. grub is a bit bigger, and so you install some code in those areas, which, then, loads some more code from a disk partition (where grub is said to be \"installed\", where its configuration file lies, along with the binary code, this is usually set to be the system /boot partition, where kernels and initrds are placed too, for convenience).\nIn this case, if it is prompting you for the disk, this means it's asking you on which Master Boot Record should grubget installed, that is, the disk you will be booting the computer from. That part of grub will be installed only on the disk MBR. The rest probably gets installed to the same partition as / or /boot/ of the Ubuntu system you're installing (and that rest is accessible from Ubuntu, look for directories /boot/grub/ or /grub/).\n\nA: Grub2 is the standard boot loader for Ubuntu. As always we prefer to have highly configurable applications. Grub2 is one of these. Grub2 will install exactly to where you told it to, irrespective of this being a good idea or not.\nMaster Boot Record\nThe usual case will be the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the drive you boot your computer from. This is most likely your first (or only) harddisk /sda. This will also be the default option when installing Grub2.\nOther drives\nOf course this boot device can also be another harddrive, a SSD, or even an external device. Then you will have to tell Grub2 where you want it to be installed when it asks you.\nPartitions\nThe case where you need to install Grub to a partition is rare but still it is possible, e.g. in case you use another bootloader and chainload Grub from a partition boot record.\nOther bootloaders\nOther bootloaders are located in the MBR as well. Grub2 will overwrite these and thus you will no longer be able to boot with these. Grub2 will take the role to boot the OS you chose from a menu displayed on boot.\nGrub application and settings\nThe Grub application, and the settings will not fit to the master boot record due to their size. Therefore they will be installed elsewhere (again you can configure this). Usually and per default Grub2 looks for it's files on the root / partition where you installed your Ubuntu, but this can also be any other partition on any of your harddrives.\nBoot partition\nSome people believe that it is a good idea to have a separate dedicated boot partition for this. But you will only need this in special cases, e.g. if you installed a UEFI BIOS which needs a GUID Partition Table (GPT) to boot from.\n\nA: Command lsblk /dev/sda or lsblk /dev/sdb etc\nwill show a label /boot or /boot/efi etc indicating the partition used by the boot manager\n\nA: It's in the MBR (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI . grub is a Bootloader.\n", "Q: Intel graphic chipset and NVIDIA Geforce GTX560 I have an NVIDIA Geforce GTX560 with two video projectors and I would like to use the onboard Intel Graphic Chipset to plug an additional monitor.\nI saw the question : How can I use both Intel onboard and Nvidia graphics at the same time? but the answer is so short that \nI was not convinced.\nMy motherboard (GIGABYTE GA-H61M-D2P-B3 (rev. 1.0)) equipped with Intel H61 Chipset allow shared memory between onboard and PCIe cards.\nAnd Windows 7 allow me to use the three outputs thanks to Intel's driver.\nI'm able to use the onboard graphic card but without graphical interface for now.\nI think i need intel driver for that.\nBut I would like to know if I can setup my displays in xorg.conf with something like :\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"Device0\"\n    Driver \"intel\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"Device1\"\n    Driver \"nvidia\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"Device2\"\n    Driver \"nvidia\"\nEndSection\n\nDoes anyone have successfully setup something like that ?

I don't even remember what Windows OS was on it.  Anyway, what I want to do is this: forget Windows and install ubuntu on this computer and then possibly sell it as a fully functional machine.  Can I download ubuntu onto a set of cd's or dvd's, using this Vista pc, then take the downloaded media to the broken machine and install ubuntu system from them?  Will the downloaded system on the cd's be bootable?  I have an old Win98 startup diskette that will boot to drive A: and that will let me change to drive D: (the cd drive).  So if the downloaded ubuntu system on cd's or dvd's is bootable, can I proceed to install it from there?\n\nA: \"missing NTLDR\" is a Windows error message (NTLDR is the small program that boots Windows NT). If your computer makes it to that error message, then it is booting properly and has no issues, it is just the windows install that's broken.\nSo, the computer is not \"non-bootable\". Depending on how old is \"old\", it may be unable to boot the installation media directly, in which case you can just use a floppy loaded with something like SmartBootManager, which is able to boot CDs itself (no matter whether the BIOS supports bootable CD's or not, SBM has its own implementation of El Torito (the bootable CD standard)).\nYou can use SBM if you have a floppy drive. I'm afraid the Windows 98 floppy won't be of much help here (there is probably some clever way to boot a live CD from MS-DOS, but it won't be as easy as just trying SBM).\n\nA: First thing to do is check if your hardware can handle Ubuntu.

X.Org does NOT support composite extension when xinerama is enabled. \nAnd all the new desktops like Unity,Gnome Shell etc. REQUIRE composite to work in the \"full\" feature mode. In my dual-monitor setup I could just use twinview and everything is fine with Unity and Gnome Shell since composite extension works with twinview.\nHowever for anyone have 3+ monitors who NEEDS to use xinerama , I strongly reccomend using XFCE under xubuntu-desktop .

I haven't found a useful answer to similar questions. I have downloaded Ubuntu 12.01 to my desktop running Windows 7 and it seems to work fine. But I want to make a CD/DVD to be able to boot Linux on another desktop PC. I can see that I get an ISO file as a result of the download, but as soon as I unzip it there is no longer an ISO file. Please help.\nFinn Nielsen  \n\nA: There is no need to unzip an ISO file.  You can burn it directly to CD using Brasero if you're already using Ubuntu, or if you are using Windows, you can use programs like Nero, PowerISO, or WinISO.\nWhile some archive programs will let you treat an ISO file like an archive and extract its contents, fundamentally an ISO file is an image for a disk. Extracting the ISO is a completely separate operation than burning it, which is what you want to do.\nThe official installation instructions explain how you can burn the ISO on a Windows system, after downloading it.\nFor more information and other programs that you can use, see this page.\n", "Q: Bash Completion Doesn't Work In Root User I'm on 12.04 and I'm trying to find a way to enable Bash completion in root user.\nAny ideas on how to do that?\n\nA: Bash completion can be enabled in the file .bashrc as explained in this Q&A. In your case it seems to be correct in your user's .bashrc, but not in your root's .bashrc. The latter file is located in /root/.bashrc.

Is that also the right place to report \"pure content\" problems like the one I have encountered?\nSince I originally posted this question, aking1012 has pointed out in chat that at least one bug filed against ubuntu-website and accepted is, like this one, a non-trivial content issue. This suggests that I can just report this against ubuntu-website...but if anyone has a definitive answer with documentation (or just more examples of such bugs, or personal experience, or if you maintain the Ubuntu website), I'd still welcome an answer here.\n\nA: Your suspicion is correct.

(more than 10000)\nI don't want Thunderbird to download them all, also because I have really slow connection.\nIs there a way to make Thunderbird download only mails more recent than, for example, 10days ago?\n\nA: No, it seems that Tbird has a BIG shortcoming in that it does not let you download \"only messages newer than  x days\".\nWe have the option to not download \"messages larger than\", so why no option to not download \"mesages older than\" ?\nIt is a big problem that developers ought to address.\nSo many people take their email on several different devices.

For example, if I open Rhythmbox, then at the top of the screen there is a text which says which song is playing. If I move my mouse over this text, then it will select this text; but I am not clicking. \nThis behaviour does not happen in all programs. For example in Firefox I have no problem at all. Maybe it is Gtk related? Nautilus also behaves strangely; I cannot open files by clicking on them, I have to select and make a box around the file and then press enter to open it. If I click, then nothing happens. Similar problems also happen with other Gtk software. \nI think the problem might be related to touchscreen issues (I have a touchscreen). I run Gnome 3 on Ubuntu 12.04. I have a HP touchsmart 610 desktop computer. Any help is greatly appreciated. \nUPDATE: I just did a fresh reinstall, and I am 90% certain that it is related to the touchscreen drivers. Here is what happens when I reinstall.

Then on next reboot I have touchscreen working , but the working touchscreen comes together with the mouse selecting everything on its own.\nSECOND QUESTION: Would anybody know how I could figure out what those touchscreen drivers are (so that I can disable them) ?\n\nA: Got to System Settings -> Universal Access -> Pointing and Clicking:\n\nMake sure you have not activated Hover Click\n\nA: There is a bug in X and it's already reported. Sadly it took a while for them to realize that it's made by X.\n\nA: Touch your screen to make it stop.\nI have the same problem on a touchscreen machine. It just happened now, and I decided to see if someone offered a solution. @mnr's mention that it might be touchscreen-related made me try: Touching the screen made the mouse stop auto-highlighting.\n\nA: In my case, it was my mouse cord on top of the touchpad the one created the mayhem.  It took me a shameful time to figure this out...   \n\nA: I experienced the same problem on Ubuntu 20.04 with a touchscreen.\nThe solution proposed by Rasmus (touch the screen) solved the problem.\nIf (like me) you don't use the touch screen without a pen, you can disable the \"finger\" part of it using the following command:\nxinput disable \"$( xinput list | grep -i Finger | sed '/Finger/s/^.*id=\\([0-9]*\\).*$/\\1/' )\"\n\n(you can reenable it using the xinput enable command with the same argument)\n", "Q: None of the DVDs can be read It does not matter what kind of DVD I try to play on either my DVD-ROM or my DVD-R/RW I get the same error message from VLC media player.  \nI have tried all disc device options.

After installing Ubuntu 12.04, which I'm using right now and it works great, my extra hard drive was detected the first time I turned on my computer but then it does not show anymore on my Home Folder, when I run the Disk Utility says that has a few errors but when I try to fix it, says that hard drive is busy and cannot do anything else.\nI've unmounted it and mounted again but nothing happens.\nDo you know what can be going on? Cause the first time that I was able to see my hard drive it had all the files I have, but I don't know if deleting the partition will format the whole hard drive or just the ubuntu files.\nTHANKS in advance!\nBY THE WAY, I'm new to Ubuntu... :S\n\nA: First thing to check is whether your drive is listed in fstab, which is a file that automagically mounts filesystems when your computer boots. You can see the contents of this file by running any of the following:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\nsudo vim /etc/fstab        #    [esc], then \":q!\" to quit\nsudo nano /etc/fstab       #     CTRL+X then enter to quit\n\nEach line is a filesystem. Look for your external drive by looking at the field after UUID=XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX it will look like /media/NameOfYourDrive unless you told the installer otherwise. Copy the UUID somewhere.\nNext, check that the UUID of your filesystem matches that. You can find the UUID of all the filesystems Ubuntu knows about by running:\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid\nls -l /dev/disk/by-label\n\nCheck that the UUID you found in fstab matches the UUID that points to your drive. (i.e., the UUID points to /dev/sdb1 and so does the label from /dev/disk/by-label, /dev/sdb1 could be anything)\nIf those match then go back to fstab and check that the filesystem type is correct (ntfs for windows drives, ext for ubuntu ones). If it is anything else, copy the line from fstab and put it in your question\n", "Q: How can I create a samba share from the command line? As part of the installation step of some software on a Ubuntu VM I'd like to create a samba share. How would I go about doing that from the command line?\n\nA: Use Samba's net usershare command to share directories from the command line, IMHO this is less clunky and much safer than fiddling around in the main smb.conf file:\nnet usershare add share_name /home/user/somefolder \"Share description\" everyone:F guest_ok=y\n\nTo make these shares permanent (i.e. persist over reboots) create a file for each share under /var/lib/samba/usershares/ like this:\nnet usershare info --long share_name > /var/lib/samba/usershares/share_name\n\nThis has a further advantage that if you're using a desktop like KDE or GNOME/MATE/Unity the directories will show up as shared in the file manager (Dolphin, Nautilus etc.). That's cause the net username//var/lib/samba/usershares/ thing is the same mechanism that Dolphin and Nautilus use when you share directories in the GUI.\nSee also: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1659816\n\nA: You can edit /etc/samba/smb.conf and enter the share name, location, and who should access it.

I am interested in buying the Asus UX32VD.\nI intend to dual boot if I end up buying it, and I was wondering how that would work out given the dual nature of the storage on this laptop (a hybrid 500GB HDD + 24GB SSD).\nWill Ubuntu and Windows be able to share the storage space? If yes, will Ubuntu also be able to use the SSD the same way Windows will, to speed up the system?\n\nA: Dual graphics might cause issues, but I don't know how the current state of dual graphics support (bumblebee etc.) is.\nFor the storage part, that hybrid HDD is probably a Seagate Momentus XT 500GB since Seagate seems to be the only manufacturer selling hybrid HDDs. The 500 model should have additional 4 GB of solid state memory that is not exposed to the operating system and works like the usual drive cache, but larger and a bit slower.\nThe 24 GB SSD should be a PCIe mini card module, something like this. (Update: Instead of PCIe mini card it would probably be mSATA) I would recommend installing Ubuntu onto the SSD, that would be a very good solution, since Ubuntu itself does not need a lot of storage space (3 to 6 GB). However remembering CES 2012, manufacturers were very happy to show us running a customized version of Android while Windows was booting or as some sort of battery saving mode. That 1 GB difference might be the space occupied by Android. Currently with the details of implementation unknown (signed bootloaders, UEFI, S-ON etc.) I would not bother tinkering with this. Sure there is Ubuntu for Android and Linaro (mostly for ARM based CPUs) but it's up to the manufacturers  to make this work, or at least to make it no more cumbersome as needed. So forget about that SSD for now until there are more details.\nBack to the hybrid drive. Like said, the SSD part is not to be exposed, so this drive can be partitioned like usual. However I can't say how the hybrid feature works out with 2 different operating systems or how it impacts the system performance in general.\nThis is very likely to be an UEFI based system which varies from the traditional BIOS/MBR devices. But since this is not a Tablet running Windows 8 and UEFI support worked well since 11.10, that's what I tested, I do not see major issues for running dual boot on this device. \n\nA: That's not a hybrid drive, those have a small 4GB+ SSD as a cache to accelerate the HDD (Momentus)\nWhat you have is essentially a small SSD and an HDD so if you want to dualboot you simply have to choose which OS goes into which drive, because with 24GB you can't fit both in the SSD and have a good experience IMO.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server Installer does not detect usb device For some time now I am struggling with the 12.04 Ubuntu Server installer. I am trying to execute a clean, CD based install with the mentioned version onto an SD card. For the sake of the simplicity I have taken out the HDD. \nHowever, I had to recognise that the \"disk detection\" phase simply can not find the SDCARD. It says \"No disk drive was detected. If you know the name of the driver needed by your disk drive, you can select from the list.\"\nWhat is really strange that I have tried the older Ubuntu Server installer (11.04) and this is simply recognising the sdcard...\nDoes anyone have any idea? \nMany thanks,\nPeter\n\nA: First of all many thanks for your feedback! \nRegarding the exact setup:  \n\n\n*\n\n*I was using a ZOTAC ZBOXHD-ID11, an external CD/DVD drive and an SD card (sitting in the zotac built in sdcard bay) which supposed to be the target of the OS install. The HDD was taken completely out for the tests.  \n\n*The setup was exactly the same in both cases only the content of the installer CD was different. :) Formerly the 11.04 (64bit server) installer downloaded directly from ubuntu and now the 12.04 (64bit server).\n\n*In both cases the CD in the drive was booted and I tried to install the OS directly onto the SD card. Using the old version it went fine, while in the latter case it failed with the mentioned error message. Of course the error message was given by the Ubuntu installer. \n\n\nIn the mean time I could work around my initial issue and I also believe that I could (hopefully) understand the root cause of the problem. So, please find my supposition (as it might be useful for others):\n\n\n*\n\n*I think that the kernel version which was shipped with the 12.04 64bit Server installer CD did not support the internal SD card reader (Realtek Semiconductor Corp. USB 2.0 multicard reader based on \"lsusb\") in the zotac box. \n\n\nHow I come to this conclusion:\n\n\n*\n\n*After fighting with the SD card for a while I decided to skip that and give it a try with an regular USB pendrive. This was correctly recognised by the installer and I could easily finish the installation process (exactly the same was as before with the old ubuntu and the SD card). What was even more interesting that after finishing the install of 12.04 I have executed the ususal \"apt-get update\" and \"apt-get dist-upgrade\" which brought a new kernel version. After rebooting this latest version was already able to see the SD-card as well. \n\n\nSo, now if I still would like to stick to the original plan I just have to copy the complete content of the pendrive onto the SD card.. ;) \nBest regards,\nPeter\n\nA: Just a couple bits of info to make sure I understand your problem here.\nAt what phase of install are you getting your 'drive not detected' message?  Is that from BIOS, or is it actually coming from the first phase of booting from the SDcard?\nAnd of course I have to ask the obvious questions; you say 11.10 worked using this method so is everything set up exactly the same way now or is something else different also?\nLastly, there was a weird problem with usb boot media made from versions other then than themselves.  Such as 10.04 usb media not booting cleanly if the stick was created with 11.10.\n\nA: I own an old Shuttle X27D - and to install from usb stick I had to switch off and disconnect the CD/DVD drive. The installation then carries on instead of telling me of missing cd drive. This helped with Ubuntu Server 64-bit 11.10 and 12.04.\nI hope it helps someone else.\n", "Q: Can't boot into Ubuntu after upgrade from Ubuntu 11 to 12.04 on dual boot system Running Dell Inspiron 15r notebook with Windows 7 Pro and 11.10 Ubuntu (also have Windows CR).  All worked fine until attempted upgrade to 12.04 system which 'locked'.\nVia Windows, uninstalled and reinstalled Ubuntu 12.04.  Windows install part went okay, but when rebooted to continue installation in 12.04 was only able to boot into grub (i.e., grub> prompt).\nHave tried to uninstall and reinstall (via Windows).  Also, ran Boot-Repair CD -- no change.\nHere is the link to the Boot-Repair's Boot Info Summary:  \n            Boot Info Script 0.61-git-patched      [23 April 2012]\n\n\n============================= Boot Info Summary: ===============================\n\n => Syslinux MBR (3.61-4.03) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda.\n\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       vfat\n    Boot sector type:  Dell Utility: FAT16\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /DELLBIO.BIN /DELLRMK.BIN /COMMAND.COM\n\nsda2: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /bootmgr /Boot/BCD /wubildr\n\nsda3: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  Windows 7\n    Boot files:        /bootmgr /Boot/BCD /Windows/System32/winload.exe \n                       /wubildr /wubildr.mbr\n\nsda4: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       Extended Partition\n    Boot sector type:  Unknown\n    Boot sector info: \n\nsda5: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows XP: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  According to the info in the boot sector, sda5 starts \n                       at sector 63.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        \n\nsda6: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows XP: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  According to the info in the boot sector, sda6 starts \n                       at sector 63.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /ubuntu/winboot/wubildr /ubuntu/winboot/wubildr.mbr \n                       /ubuntu/disks/root.disk /ubuntu/disks/swap.disk\n\nsda6/Wubi: _____________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       \n    Boot sector type:  Unknown\n    Boot sector info: \n    Mounting failed:   mount: unknown filesystem type ''\n\nsda7: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows XP: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  According to the info in the boot sector, sda7 starts \n                       at sector 63.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        \n\nsda8: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  According to the info in the boot sector, sda8 starts \n                       at sector 63.\n    Operating System:  Windows 7\n    Boot files:        /bootmgr /Boot/BCD /Windows/System32/winload.exe\n\nsda9: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  According to the info in the boot sector, sda9 starts \n                       at sector 319.

The sys76 driver installs a ppa in your repositories, so as long as you update your system it should also be updated (I believe we are now in version 3.0.x). If you downloaded the deb file from their website and installed it then you have the drivers running. In case of doubt you can always open them and click in restore defaults, which will bring the drivers to the same config as to when you bought your machine.This is also the procedure when you perform a fresh ubuntu install or upgrade in your system.\nYou can open your dash and type system76. If you see a black sys76 logo then you have the drivers installed.\nOther than that syst76 drivers works just fine and are transparent to the user.

What would be the best way to have a server recognize when a specific mobile device (cell phone, iPad, etc.) connects to the network (wirelessly, of course)? \nAs an example situation, a person has his home wifi network properly configured on his cellphone. When he gets within range of the router, it would connect (nothing new about that). Upon connection to that router, his home server would launch a certain program (or throw a notification, write to a file, etc.). \nI thought that a possible solution would be a network-hosted custom \"web app\" that would be launched from the phone so that the server would recognize the page was called. However, if this could be done when the phone connects automatically, that would be best. \nAny thoughts or alternate solutions would be greatly appreciated, so thanks in advance!\n\nA: I think this can be easily accomplished by arp-scan.\nInstall arp-scan: sudo apt-get install arp-scan\nDetect all the hosts on the local network: sudo arp-scan -l \nYou can set up a crontab to periodically (every 2 mins maybe) run a script that scans the network with arp-scan and parses its output to discover the active hosts.\nSometimes I needed the -r 3 flag, which runs it three times; works much better as the default 2 times, which sometimes miss some devices. Thus: \n sudo arp-scan -l -r 3 | grep {Phone Static Assigned IP} \n\nworks better for me to LG V30+.\n\nA: import subprocess\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    while True:\n        sleep(5)\n        p = subprocess.Popen(\"arp-scan -l | grep xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\", stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)\n        (output, err) = p.communicate()\n        p_status = p.wait()\n        if output:\n            print \"Yay, the devine is connected to your network!\"\n        else:\n            print \"The device is not present!\"\n\nThis way you can scan for the MAC of your device :)\n\nA: I am actually contemplating to implement a solution for this that meets following requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*The phone does not need to have assigned IP address on the network.\n\n*The phone does not need to periodically send out signals that would drain its battery.\n\n*If there are many phones on the network, all of them would be detected.\n\n\nMy intention is to mount the phones filesystem with ssh, but it could be used for whatever.\nLet's say the local network is 192.168.1.0...\nSo I would implement an APP that listens to UDP broadcasts from the broadcast address: 192.168.1.255. This app would not drain battery as it totally passive. (it only gets active when a packet is received).\nA daemon on the computer will will periodically send out broadcasts to the broadcast address 192.168.1.255. The phone will reply to such signals giving its name, id, ip address etc.\nNow the computer know that the phone exists on the network and for my case can invoke sshfs mount.\nSurely this needs a lot of work, including programming work, and is not easy. But I think it would be the most reliable and reasonable solution.  \n\nA: The best way I can think of is to give said device a static IP address, and use a simply script to ping the device every X seconds and trigger your program / notification.\nThings to note: Many phones won't connect to the wifi network until the wake up from sleep. Your script will need to be able to tell the difference between the phone going to sleep and the phone leaving the house, possibly by considering the time of day. After that, having the script trigger a program to run or a notification to appear is trivial.\n\nA: I wrote a script that does something similar using arp-scan and a static IP address on an iPhone. \nYou can find the code here: https://github.com/blackairplane/pydetect\nIt needs to be cleaned up as I am new to Python, but I think it illustrates the concept.\n\nA: I stumbled on this and as I once did something similar decided to post an answer.\nI did the following:\n1. Ping all addresses within given network and subnet (excluding network and broadcast addresses)\n2. Wait for response has a timeout so that if device doesn't answer from furthest corner of your WiFi it is considered not present.\n3. So we get all IPs on the net that answer to ICMP packets.\n4. Then use each detected IP to ask for more and decide which device you like and which one you don't.\n\nIn my case I had an HTTP server running on my device. So I just sent HTTP HEAD request for essentially nothing on port 80. If device responded and Server header is properly named, then this is my device.\nBut I couldn't go fast without pinging first. HTTP is TCP and request is big, so timeouts have to be 4 seconds for WiFi. Doing this for 253 addresses is slow as hell. But you wouldn't have 253 devices (probably) more less HTTP servers. (or in your case, phones)\nConsidering router logs is very good idea, and easy. And even faster than pinging all. Some routers do not even need logging in for getting to them.\nAlso, it is worth checking whether your device has UPNP support. If it does, you can use UPNP to detect its presence. This would be official solution (listening on broadcast for UDPs of UPNP). But all devices does not support it. But all devices do not support ICMP also. (they don't wish to be bombarded needlessly).\nThere is another interesting possibility. You can fish for DHCP packets and see when a router is giving a new device an IP address. But this wouldn't work for devices with static IPs. They wouldn't even touch the network until they need something. Connecting to WiFi itself is on another layer and cannot be easily detected unless you wish to act as a sniffer. I am not sure even if it is doable with network adapter in a promisquous mode. I think additional hardware would be needed for this.\nTo achieve ping in Python, without subprocessing to ping program and losing speed, you have to create raw socket and construct ICMP packet manually. It is not hard. There is example of it somewhere on the web. Of course, to send it you will need root permissions as does the ping. This is a drawback. If you will distribute the software you cannot expect users to want to run it as root.\n\nA: I had two solutions that I used. (Python)\nSolution 1\nFirst was to arping known ipnumbers that I want to track.\nI did this in three steps.\n1# use \"-c1\" to only send one ping.if the device is active it will reply and. The function will exit with success\n2# use \"-c3\" now give it more time to reply on one of three. This is usually enough when it's a poor wifi signal.\n3# use \"-c10\" this might be needed when it's really bad wifi signal. (Noticed the old iPad needs about 10 tries to answer)\nTo speed up things I created separate Processes for each ip number I want to track.\nI also changed the pinging intervals depending on if it's a success or not. If it finds the device it will wait longer until it checks again.\nIf it's a failure it will try again in 60 seconds. (I want the light on when I enter my home) so 60s is enough to find me on the street\nThis worked perfectly! When I got home it sensed me and turned out the light, and off when I left.\nSolution 2\nArping might not be heavy on the network but I changed the solution to skip all pings and created my own DHCP server on my raspberry pi.\nI then added \"on commit\" which trigger a script as soon as a device gets an ipnumber. This script use a 'curl http API call'  to notify my www server (Flask) as soon as a device gets or renew it's ipnumber.\nOn my Android I changed the settings to never turn off wifi when the screen is off. Not sure if it's possible on iPhone. No big difference on battery (OnePlus 5)\nThe first solution also included Bluetooth scanning for specific Mac.\nSo even if my WiFi is off on my phone it will still sense the Bluetooth. Using Mac address don't need to pair it or have it available for everyone to see.\n", "Q: Connecting Galaxy Note: Unable to mount Android Error initializing camera: -53: Could not claim the USB device I'm running cm9 ics on my Galaxy Note and i tried anything i could find googleing around but to no result, if i look on the phone in usb settings there is the option for mass storage but it's grey and therefore not selectable\nI don`t know what the problem is but i saw somwhere that it might be an old version of libmtp so i tried to install libmtp 1.1.3 with ./configure make make install but even after when i try mtp-detect it gives me libmtp 1.1.1 is it normal?\nanyway when i run mtp-detect here is what it gives me\nlibmtp version: 1.1.1\n\nListing raw device(s)\nDevice 0 (VID=04e8 and PID=6860) is a Samsung GT-P7310/P7510/N7000/I9100/Galaxy Tab 7.7/10.1/S2/Nexus/Note.\n   Found 1 device(s):\n   Samsung: GT-P7310/P7510/N7000/I9100/Galaxy Tab 7.7/10.1/S2/Nexus/Note (04e8:6860) @ bus 2, dev 6\nAttempting to connect device(s)\nignoring usb_claim_interface = -99PTP_ERROR_IO: failed to open session, trying again after resetting USB interface\nLIBMTP libusb: Attempt to reset device\nignoring usb_claim_interface = -99LIBMTP PANIC: failed to open session on second attempt\nUnable to open raw device 0\nOK. \n\nThanks in advamce\n\nA: I had a very similar problem until I read this this morning.

Are there any tools that are capable of this? It seems that if I could write the partition table at a low level, I'd be able to accomplish this. What do you recommend?\nBy the way, I use an encrypted home directory (that's $HOME, not /home), and previously my swap was encrypted. I don't know how encrypted swap is set up.\n\nA: Rather than manually editing the partition tables you could just recreate your old partition table using gparted and either use cp -p or dd to copy the old partitions into the new ones.\nExternal storage requirements\nHow you do so depends on your external storage capabilities.  If you have another drive that you can copy the partitions you should copy the primary partition(s) to an image (for dd) or directory (for cp) on the external drive, then create an empty logical partition and and copy the image into this new empty partition. This would be the best way to go about things.\nTo back partitions up as images somewhere (sda1 being the first partition on your first hard drive):\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=[path to where you want to store the image] bs=1M noerror\n\nTo copy partitions to a directory (preserving permissions) first mount them then:\nsudo mkdir /[path to where you want to store them]/partition-backup1\nsudo cp -pr /media/mounted-partition-to-be-copied /[path to where you want to store them]/partition-backup1\n\nSee below for more information on cp and dd.\nIf you don't have external storage\nHowever, if you don't have enough space/time to copy to partitions to external storage first, you could potentially use creative resizing/copying to do the entire move on the same drive.  In other words, you could resize partitions with a lot of free space down to a smaller size give you the room to create new duplicate logical partitions and then delete the old one and resize back up after the copy.  You would also need to temporarily store one partition as an image inside of another one so you could create the extended partition.\nHowever, be careful if any of the partitions (/home, swap, etc) are encrypted.  If so it would be very, very dangerous to resize them.  There is a guide for resizing encrypted partitions here but I wouldn't recommend doing so unless you really cannot find any external storage to avoid this step.\nCopying the old primary partitions into new logical partitions\nFirst make sure you have a liveCD/USB handy, you will probably need to reinstall GRUB later.\nI'm assuming here that you have assessed the method best for you and have now created an empty new logical partition and have access to either the old primary partition or an image of the partition stored externally.\nYou can either use cp which copies file by file or dd which copies blocks of raw data.  For any encrypted partitions you will have to use dd.  I personally feel that when used correctly dd is safer because you don't have to worry about permissions/ownership/symlinks/etc.  However if you make a mistake using dd you will break something.\nTo use cp: (for non-encrypted partitions) first mount both the old primary version of the partition and the new empty logical partition.  The copy the files from the old partition to the new ones. The -p option preserves the permissions and owners of the files so you don't mess up your permissions, -r just copies recursively.   However it cannot create files with owners above the permissions of whoever is running the command so you shoul run this command as root.\nsudo cp -pr /media/[mounted-old-primary]/ /media/[mounted-empty-logical]/\n\nThis might take awhile.\nTo use dd: You need to be absolutely sure of the partition names of your old and new partitions.  You should also be cloning partitions that are exactly the same size (or to a partition that is larger--at your own risk). Do not try cloning to a partition that is smaller than the original. dd will overwrite any device it is ordered to copy to.  Either use the gparted GUI to get these right or you can run sudo fdisk -l to see the partition table.  Once you are sure of your names run the dd command (must be run as root to write directory to devices)\nPeople googling in: DO NOT run the following commands unless you understand what they do and have changed the partition names to the partitions your want to copy/overwrite\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/dev/sda6 bs=1M noerror\n\nIn this example sda2 is the original primary partition and sda6 is the new, empty logical partition.  Be sure to check that you've changed the pathes correctly before each operations.\nIf you are copying from an image you backed up, run a command like this:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/image.img of=/dev/sda6 bs=1M noerror\n\nEither of these will also take awhile.  You can make sure they are still running by checking top and noting various related processes chugging along.\nCleaning up\nDo not delete anything until you are sure that it has copied correctly and that you will not need the backup anymore.  That said once you've successfully copied everything onto the new logical partitions you will want to remove the old primary partitions and resize all the partitions to how you want them.\nYou haven't touched the MBR at all but if you've moved the partition with /boot on it, you will need to reinstall/upgrade GRUB so it points to the new partition.\nReinstall GRUB from a liveCD by mounting your / directory (replace sda3 with whatever partition it is for you)\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\n\nAt this point you could run sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda to reinstall grub but you would still need to run update-grub from the native installtion (meaning a rescue boot from the GRUB command line) to update the config files.  We can combine both these steps and use chroot to make the / partition the liveCD's / filesystem.\n(This part heavily based on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing)\n\nMount the critical virtual filesystems. Run the following as a single\n  command:\n  for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\nChroot into your normal system device:\n  sudo chroot /mnt\nReinstall GRUB 2:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\nRecreate the GRUB 2 menu file (grub.cfg)\nupdate-grub\n\nExit chroot: CTRL+D\nReboot.\nsudo reboot\n\n\n\nA: Having and encrypted /dev/sda3 doesn't help matters here.  There is no tool that will move partitions onto an extended partition automatically.  You are going to have to do this manually, however the good news is that you've only got 70 odd Gb of data on home and extra to back up and restore.\nI suggest you back up the data from /dev/sda3 (home) and /dev/sda4 (extra) and delete the partitions.  I note that you actually had two swap partitions originally.\nOnce you've backed up the data, delete /dev/sda3 and /dev/sda4, and in their place make one extended partition.  You can then create partitions for /home, swap, and extra as well if you want.  I recommend ext4 for /home (not ext3 as you have currently) and not encrypted unless you have really sensitive data on there. consider if \"extra\" is superfluous to your needs.\nUsing volume label as a basis for mounting partitions in fstab seems to work very well. It's just a matter of changing 'UUID=uuid' to 'LABEL=volume_label' in fstab once the partition labels have been assigned.  This is easier to do manually and easy to change later, since you don't have to deal with spaghetti uuid numbers.  I'm not sure you can assign a volume name to the swap partition however.\nChris\n", "Q: How to extract archives to file system in terminal? I installed jupiter and I use the radiance theme so the icon doesnt look right, so I found this answer on how to change it How can I change the icon for Jupiter?.  It mentions needing superuser access and I figured using sudo in terminal would be eaiser than enabling root or whatever I need to do, but I can't find anything on here that explains how to extract a tar.bz file to a directory in terminal.\n\nA: Method 1: Extracting the Files, Then Copying Them as Root\nNavigate in the Terminal to wherever the file is located. For example, if it's located in the Downloads folder inside your home folder, run this command:\ncd ~/Downloads\n\nThe ~ character in this context is an abbreviation for the full name of your home folder. (For instance, if your username is jeff, it is an abbreviation for /home/jeff.)\nNow extract the archive with tar. Since that file is a .gz archive, you'll use the z flag to tell tar this:\ntar xvzf Jupiter_Radiance_theme_icons.tar.gz\n\nx means to extract. v means to list the files as it extracts them (you can leave this off if you like). z means to gunzip it (as the .tar archive is itself compressed with gzip--that's what the .gz extension designates). f means to extract it here in the filesystem (and the need for it is an artifact of the older common use of tar, to create and extract tape archives).\nThe archive you just extracted contains three files (you saw their filenames if you kept the v flag in the command). Their names are bolt1.png, bolt2.png, and bolt4.png. So now, copy these files to /usr/share/pixmaps. This is the part that requires root privileges, so this is where you should use sudo:\nsudo cp --no-preserve=ownership bolt1.png bolt2.png bolt4.png /usr/share/pixmaps\n\nYou had extracted them as your own (non-root) user, which gave you ownership over them. But root should own the files in /usr/share/pixmaps, which is why you should use the --no-preserve=ownership argument to cp. Since you are copying the files as root in a directory owned by root, the copy you make will be owned by root as is proper.\nMethod 2: Copying and Extracting the Archive as Root\nYou might find it simpler to do everything as root. Then root will own the files initially, because root will extract them. The easiest way to do this is to put the archive in the destination folder (if it's not already there).\nSupposing the file is located in Downloads:\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo cp Jupiter_Radiance_theme_icons.tar.gz /usr/share/pixmaps\n\nPlease note that you could instead have used mv instead of cp to move it instead of copying it (provided that the source and target folders are on the same partition).\nNow go to the target folder and extract the archive:\ncd /usr/share/pixmaps\nsudo tar xzvf Jupiter_Radiance_theme_icons.tar.gz\n\nYou should probably remove the archive, because it's not good to have extraneous files in /usr/share/pixmaps:\nsudo rm Jupiter_Radiance_theme_icons.tar.gz\n\nMethod 3: Just Extracting the Archive as Root\nIf you like, you can keep the archive wherever you downloaded it, and just extract it to /usr/share/pixmaps as root. (Thanks to adempewolff for suggesting I present this method.)\ncd /usr/share/pixmaps\nsudo tar xzvf ~/Downloads/Jupiter_Radiance_theme_icons.tar.gz\n\nThis works because tar will, by default, extract the archive to whatever folder you are in, rather than to the folder the archive is in (if they are different).\nOther Methods\nYou can easily make a variation of Method 1 where you extract the files graphically with the Archive Manager, then copy them in the Terminal with sudo. But you can also do both as root, by running Nautilus (the file browser) as root. If you do this, you can perform any file management task with Nautilus, and any programs you launch from Nautilus will also run as root. You have to be careful with this, because you can damage your system by making a mistake (just as you can by running the wrong command with sudo), and because it would be particularly bad to forget that this Nautilus window was running as root rather than normally.\nTo run graphical programs as root, don't use sudo directly. Instead, use gksu. So, to run Nautilus as root, you could press Alt+F2 and run:\ngksu nautilus\n\nIf you do this, make sure to close the Nautilus window when you're done, and to only use it for tasks where you know you need to be root (like making changes to the contents of /usr/share/pixmaps).\nYou could even do a variation of Method 2 or Method 3 where you don't copy anything as root, but instead extract the archive as root graphically, by running the Archive Manager as root. To do this, press Alt+F2 and run:\ngksu file-roller\n\nHowever, most users find it easier to extract files by launching the Archive Manager from within Nautilus, because then it opens knowing what archive you want it to use. (You can pass the name of the archive as part of the file-roller command...but at this point you start to lose the ease-of-use benefit of GUI over command-line.)\nSuggested Resources\nTo learn more about extracting files with tar, see man tar.\nIf the archive had been .tar.bz2, you would use j instead of z. If it had been .xz, you would use J instead. For all other information, see that manual page.\nTo learn more about performing administrative tasks in Ubuntu, see the community documentation on sudo and root, and also man sudo and man gksu (or man kdesudo if you're using Kubuntu).\nThe community documentation on File Compression is worth a read, to learn more about archives and file compression. (Technically these are two related and overlapping but different things. For example: A .tar file is an archive. A .gz file is compressed.)\nMost of the time you use tar it will probably not be to create and restore backups, but it can be useful for that, plus, understanding how that works enhances your understanding of what tar can and cannot do and how to use it. If this interests you, see the community documentation on backing up your system with tar.\n", "Q: Which is the best method to install/uninstall apps in Ubuntu? While apps can be installed with the apt-get command, Synaptic Package Manager or Ubuntu Software Centre, can anybody throw some light on which is the best method? I recently installed kubuntu-desktop and as a result even Ubuntu Software Centre showed that it was installed. When I tried uninstalling it with Ubuntu Software Centre, the package didn't actually uninstall until I used Synaptic once again.\n\nA: For most users, using the Ubuntu software center would be fine because it provides a simple GUI that allows to install and uninstall apps.  sudo apt-get install and sudo apt-get remove would also be good because they're the only commands in the terminal that don't make normal Ubuntu users feel frustrated.\nBut for advanced users, they might need to use Synaptic Package Manager because they only want to install or uninstall a specific package, like GTK.\nSo, for installing and uninstalling software, I would use the Software Center.\nI would also use sudo apt-get if I can't install through the software center and sudo apt-get --purge remove to remove the software.

As an alternative to using gsmctl as in the accepted answer, you can use qmicli.

I have a dual boot system with a previous 10.04 version of Ubuntu and Windows 7. \nI need to upgrade the existing version of Ubuntu while working on my dual boot safely. \nIs there a specific way to do that?\n\nA: Whenever it comes to upgrading Ubuntu, there are many ways to do it. What I would recommend (especially to keep the integrity of your dual boot) is to open up \"Update Manager\" from the Dash menu/Applications menu. Then, run the upgrade to 12.04 that is listed near the top. This will upgrade 12.04 but there will be no negative effect to your dual boot.\n\nA: The upgrade won't disturb your dual boot setup. On Ubuntu, you can initiate the release upgrade by a simple command:\ndo-release-upgrade\n\nI can confirm that it works flawlessly for an upgrade from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to 20.04 LTS on a dual boot system with Windows 10 (using GRUB 2 as Bootloader, without full disk encryption).\n", "Q: \"Try Ubuntu\" option is not displayed I created a live USB using Unetbootin (distribution: Ubuntu 12.04 ) from the alternate installation ISO, but while booting \"Try Ubuntu\" option is not displayed in the Unetbootin menu.

This solved the problem for me.\n", "Q: Is it possible to write programs for other OSs in Ubuntu? Is there an Integrated Developemnt Environment (IDE) that enables us to write programs for Windows and Mac in Ubuntu?\n\nA: From http://monodevelop.com/\n\nMonoDevelop is an IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET\n  languages. MonoDevelop enables developers to quickly write desktop and\n  ASP.NET Web applications on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. MonoDevelop\n  makes it easy for developers to port .NET applications created with\n  Visual Studio to Linux and to maintain a single code base for all\n  platforms.\n\nMonoDevelop is based on Mono, a free open source implementation of the .NET Framework. Mono supports C#, but also supports Visual Basic 8. MonoDevelop supports multiple languages, including C# and Visual Basic, So if you prefer to develop in VB, you can do that with MonoDevelop on Ubuntu, and you can run your VB programs on Ubuntu (and Windows) too.\nSounds like that is what you need.\n\nA: You can cross-compile Windows executables under Ubuntu using the mingw32 package, as described in the answers to this question:\nHow to program for Windows in Ubuntu?\nAlternatively, if you stick to platform independent APIs (e.g. GTK or Qt for graphical applications, or any other libraries that are portable to the target system) it is possible to port to Windows or MacOS without too much trouble.\nIn either case, you will probably want to test them on your chosen target platform to make sure they actually function correctly there.  So it won't necessarily remove the need to access those platforms.\n\nA: Qt Creator is one such IDE:\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/qt-creator/\n\nA: No one has said java !\nAnd the most popular ide eclipse\nJava for apple.\n\nA: You should definiely consider Java or Python, both languages are platform-independent and are relatively easy to program. But the advantage with python is that you do not have to compile it so that it does not have to be compiled in Windows to run on it.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 12.04 in Dell Inspiron 1420 I want to install Ubuntu 12.04 on a Dell Inspiron 1420.\nCurrently that system has Windows Vista installed on it.\nAfter installing Ubuntu, do I need to install all drivers separately?\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu is usually enough, as it contains the code necessary to run on most hardware. If drivers are required, it will attempt to prompt you via an Additional Drivers dialog.\nAs such, you do not need to install drivers individually.  \nYou can also read a guide on How to Install Ubuntu 12.04.\n", "Q: In Unity, the folder containing a file selected in the dash is opened in Nautilus instead of opening the file with the corresponding application \nPossible Duplicate:\nFiles lens and xdg-open only open nautilus but not the correct applicatiion \n\nIn 12.04, since yesterday the behavior of the dash in Unity has changed.\nPreviously (and I assume it is the default choice), when selecting a file in the dash, the file was automatically opened with its corresponding application. Now, the folder containing the file is opened in Nautilus instead.\n(I have to mention that I have installed XFCE) \nHow do I revert to the first behaviour ?\nThanks.\n\nA: I found someone having a similar problem on the Ubuntu forums. And this problem was linked to the presence of an installation of the XFCE desktop environment.\nBecause it was also my case, I used a solution suggested in this thread, which simply consists in erasing all traces of XFCE installation.\nI opened a terminal and enter the following command :\nsudo apt-get remove `dpkg -l | grep xfce|awk '{print $2}'`\n\nNow, I can't use XFCE anymore but the normal behavior of the dash has been restored.\n", "Q: Overlayfs reload with multiple layers (migration away from aufs) I've come across one of those aufs to overlayfs migration headaches. With aufs you could specify multiple RO-layers and updating some files in them was refreshed with remount. \nfstab with aufs:\naufs    /etc                       aufs    noauto,br:/rw-root/etc=rw:/ro-root/etc=ro:/etc=rr  0 0\n\nSame functionality with overlayfs:\nnone    /.tmp-root/etc              overlayfs  noauto,upperdir=/ro-root/etc,lowerdir=/etc      0 0 \nnone    /etc                       overlayfs  noauto,upperdir=/rw-root/etc,lowerdir=/.tmp-root/etc  0 0 \n\nMounting the system in order is fine and everything works. The problem arises when I need to update something on the ro-root partition. Running remount on that sees /etc as the already mounted overlayfs and not the original ro-root.  (Solved the striked-out problem with mount --bind)\nApparently the problem is with inode numbers of the files. So editing of a file works fine, but if I copy a new file over the old one on the lower level, the change is not propagated. So this could be a real overlayfs problem.\nI'd really like this setup to continue working (restructuring everything is quite a lot of work and testing that I'd rather avoid, because this affects +50 virtualmachines).\nThat being said, I will also accept answers that would accomplish moving readonly-root after initrd-stage safely to go around this problem and if that's not possible then suggestion most minimalistic way of changing/modifying/creating initrd to accomplish this move.\nThere's another related question, but it's the simpler form of just two layers.\nSimple overlayfs reload question\n\nA: have you tried running remount on /.tmp-reoot/etc first and then remount on /etc\ne.g.:\n mount -o remount /.tmp-reoot/etc\n\n mount -o remount /etc\n\n", "Q: USB needed to boot ubuntu after successful installation \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan't boot without Flash Drive plugged in \n\nsimilar problem \nMy problem is very much like the problem described in the link.\nI have FreeDOS and Ubuntu 12.04. \nWhen I boot without bootable USB the computer simply proceeds to DOS.\n With USB stick I have to enter ubuntu via BIOS. \nI WISH TO REINSTALL Ubuntu.

I mean when you add a text, that will be on a single layer and you should Merge it with Layers like this :\n1.You add text.\n\n2.Right click on text's layer ~> Merge Down so it merges Text Layer with the layer that's at bottom of this.\n3.Now you have one layer with text.\n\nYou should Merge your text with all layers to have it for the whole duration.\nAlso, for Script-fu Effects similar to outerglow, you should do this too, or to do this easier, when you're making effect, check up \"Merge With Layer\" and it's done!\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: How to enable RELRO support?

Parameters are used to run executable with changed default parameters. So parameters are used to change behaviour.\nthere is many parameter on site you provided with different uses of it.\nhere first parameter is -instance-id=1 Used when launching several instances simultaneously, each instance using its own config and dump files (to be effective, instance-id must be the 1st argument). Which states id is 1.\nnow second parameter -win_y=200 which is used to give Window position - y \ninstances will be closed if you close terminal to prevent this prefix nohup to command. so it will become\nnohup /usr/bin/tickr -instance-id=1 -win_y=200 & /usr/bin/tickr -instance-id=2 -win_y=250\nyou can use any number of parameters.\nhope this helps.\n", "Q: How to set up Google Chrome as default browser in Xubuntu I use Xubuntu 12.04.

Then put it back in the \"target\" computer and install Ubuntu 12.04 on it, partitioning as desired. Don't forget the 100MB \"boot\" partition Windows 7 usually creates at the beginning of the drive.\nThis will work fine as long as Windows 7 is installed at the beginning of the drive, i.e. Fedora is installed after Windows as seen in gparted. If you want to give the power user way a try, even dd will do the job, i.e. dd if=/dev/sdSOURCE of=/dev/sdTARGET bs=1M, and then use gparted on the target (500GB) drive to remove the Fedora 16 partitions.\nAlso, if grub is your bootloader, as is normally the case when dual-booting wih Windows, removing Fedora may also remove your ability to boot Windows until Ubuntu 12.04 installs it's own copy of grub with the appropriate boot entries. \nWhatever you do, be sure to keep your 320GB source drive safe until you verify everything is working on the 500GB drive, including Windows.

I installed 12.04 on it. \nEvery time I boot the display's brightness sets to the highest setting: maximum_brightness 15. This is way too bright and want to set it to 4.\nI have spent a long time trying to fix this. Tried editing rc.local file by adding the \"echo 0 >\" line before exit 0. But it never works. laptop always resets to level 15 after boot. I tried everything here: Desktop doesn't remember brightness settings after a reboot\nWhy isn't rc.local working for me?\nDoes anyone know how I can edit the maximum_brightness down? Can I set a lower maximum_brightness?\n\nA: You need to set the script rc.local to start automatically at start up. If that doesn't work go to /sys/class/backlight/ and run the \"echo 0\" to the \"brightness scripts\" in the folders there and if your brightness changes instantly then you know where the brightness config is and just note its location so that you can modify your rc.local again.\n\nA: I also am affected by this. It is a bug that the rc.local file does not execute at startup.\nHere's a link to the bug report: Launchpad Bug Report\n\nA: Temporary fix that should work: \n\n\n*\n\n*Add this line just before exit 0 line in /etc/default/rc.local file: \ncp -f /etc/default/brightness-customized /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\n*Create a file named /etc/default/brightness-customized with the content of file being just a number on a scale of 1 to 12. I am not sure about scale, but lets say you want low brightness. Then, put a number say, 2 in the file. So on running command:  cat /etc/default/brightness-customized it should output: \n2 \ni.e. #brightness level you want to have\nNow things should work atleast everytime you boot (start/restart) the

The client that I'm using is a mac osx lion. I think I understand the theory but I keep hitting roadblocks.\nI started using set proxy server ubuntu linux tutorial here. I already found a spare pc and installed ubuntu 12 on it. According to the article, I have to create an ssh tunnel from how to tunnel traffic with ssh article. \nIn ubuntu, I made sure that I have ssh server so I did a apt-get install ssh. \nThen, it is time to forward ports on my router to individual machine. The individual machine, I assume, is my ubuntu machine which will act as a ssh server. My router is a Cisco Linksys E3000.\nAs I try to set up port forwarding, I came across this article. This is where it confuses me:\n\nEnter your application name. For a list of which ports an application might use, see the Sources and Citations section below.\n\nIt seems that I have to know which application and what port they are using to access the internet??? For example, if I use the terminal in OSX, I need to specify 'Terminal' as the application and know what port it uses? And I need to repeat that for Chrome, firefox, App Store, Diablo 3, etc...?\nIs that the standard way of channeling your internet traffic through a proxy so you can bypass firewall?\nHow do I set up my proxy such that all my internet connections goes through my ubuntu server and channels it back to my client (Mac OSX).\nIf anyone is interested, I wanted to do this because as I use heroku for my web app deployment, I keep running into firewalls at my workplace, while traveling, etc...\nThanks!!!\n\nA: Using SSH tunnels: Ports and port forwarding on your router:\nUsing an ssh tunnel as a proxy involves setting up a local proxy on the default socks5 port (1080).  All applications will then send their web traffic to that port, and it will then be sent through the encrypted ssh tunnel to your server and then to the internet.\nThe only application that your router needs to forward ports for is the ssh client/server--route all incoming TCP requests on port 22, to the IP address of your server on your local network.\nHere's a picture illustrating this:\n\nLet's take a look at the command used to create the SSH tunnel to understand how it works.\nssh -ND 1080 user@11.11.11.111 -p 22\n\nThe above command is what creates this tunnel from the client to the server.  -D 1080 set what sets up the socks5 proxy at local port 1080 for your applications to use.  This is all on your local machine.  Port 1080 does not need to be routed anywhere using your router.\nuser is your username on your server.  11.11.11.111 is the ip address of your server.  -p 22 is the port that the ssh client tries to connect to your ssh server using (port 22 is the default so you don't really need to include -p 22 in your command if you haven't changed from the default, I just added it in for explanation purposes).  This is the port that you will need to make sure your router is forwarding to your server.  If you choose not to use the default ssh port (22) you will also need to configure your ssh server to listen on a different port.\nTo make applications use this tunnel...\nyou just have to modify their proxy settings (or use a global proxy--I'm not familiar with how OS X does this though) to use a socks5 proxy at localhost:1080 or 127.0.0.1:1080.  For example this is how to do this with Firefox:\nUsing the menus go to Edit:Preferences:Advanced:Network:(connection)Settings\n\nTo set a global proxy on OS X\nI don't use OS X but the OP confirmed that this works (see comments).  You can try installing this GUI tool for OS X, navigating to System Preferences -> Network -> Advanced... -> Proxies and entering 127.0.0.1 as the server and 1080 as the port.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: If you want to put all your traffic, you need to use a VPN. i would recommend OpenVPN for this, it is quite easy to install and work on both OS X and Linux.\nThere is already a good documentation on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenVPN.\nAnother solution is to look at tor, or use ssh -w, but this requires you to change setting of every application to use the proxy.\nAnd if you have trouble at work, i think you should get in touch with your system admin, he can surely open firewall if there is a business reason.\n", "Q: Code Vision AVR for Ubuntu IS there any ways that I can use the Code Vision AVR Compiler?

This is my current partition map:\n\nI am currently running GParted in an Ubuntu 12.04 live environment. I am having trouble finding out how to merge my unallocated space with /dev/sda2. I have heard that the partitions must be adjacent to each other to be able to merge, and if so I am 99% sure that if I reinstall my Ubuntu partition (/dev/sda3) to start at the end of the unallocated space rather than the beginning, I will be able to somehow MacGyver my way through this, although this is a last resort if even possible at all. I could use any help whatsoever.\n\nA: (1)If you delete the extended partition that is there, sda3 in your case, and reinstall it at the end of the drive you will be able to extend the windows 7 partition to use the free space. You could also do this in the other order, delete the partition, extend windows, then re install ubuntu. \n(2)You might be able to just move the partitions but that will depend on where you installed grub, on the partition or on the hard disk MBR. I would burn a bootloader such as chimera to a cd in case this dosent work 100%, it will probably allow you to boot into windows/ ubuntu anyway. \n\nA: You can't merge a primary partition with an extended partition.  You can delete the extended partition, and then spend a lot of time making the primary partition bigger.  But then you'll just have a big primary NTFS partition, and you will probably have to spend even more time shrinking it to make room for Ubuntu.  \nIf I were you, I would decide first how big you want your Windows partition.  If you want to continue using it, you probably want to make it bigger, since it's nearly full.  So, you will need to delete the extended partition.  Then you can make the Windows partition to whatever size you want it, and create an extended partition for Ubuntu and whatever other logical drives you want.  My advice is do not create any more primary partitions (ever).\nIf you wanted to switch to Ubuntu as your main system, you could leave things as they are, and install it in the existing extended partition.\n", "Q: Does the files gets deleted from U1 servers when I stop synchronizing When I removed the sync folder online (one.ubuntu.com), does the files gets deleted from Ubuntu Servers?\n\nA: I don't know how much time the U1 servers keep the folder you delete.

You may do a control of the actual situation.  Download Gparted (it is for free) http://gparted.sourceforge.net/download.php, burn it to a disc, and boot you computer from this disc.  This will give you an idea what is going on.  You can make a separate partition for ubuntu (ext4) and a swap (max. 2Gb), and install Ubuntu in this partition.

Click \"add\".\n\n*Log out > log in.\n\nA: Doing YourWindowManager --replace means xfwm4 has already started upon login and you are now stopping it to start a new window manager...that's working but there's a quicker and cleaner way as this guy explains taking kwin as his example.\nXFCE starts the window manager specified in /etc/xdg/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-session.xml or, under xubuntu, in /etc/xdg/xdg-xubuntu/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-session.xml\nIn this file look for the Client0_Command property and edit its value: <value type=\"string\" value=\"xfwm4\"/> to <value type=\"string\" value=\"kwin\"/> (obviously, replace \"kwin\" with your window manager of choice) You would need to go root. You could also copy and only edit that file in /home/user/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-session.xml if you want the changes to only affect your userspace.\nBecause in XFCE it is common for us to save our session while logging out, don't forget to clean your session: Settings Manager->Session and Startup->Session tab->Clear saved sessions\nNow you can logout and back in. \n\nA: To change it to xfwm4, the following command should work. This would change it back to the setting Xfce has by default out of the box.\nxfconf-query --channel xfce4-session --property /sessions/Failsafe/Client0_Command --type string --set 'xfwm4' --type string --set '--replace'\n\nA: If you prefer a GUI solution, go to:\nSettings >> Desktop Settings. In the Desktop Settings dialog, change the Window Manager to the manager of your choice.\nDesktop Settings, Window Manager\nThis works in Linux Mint 20.2\n", "Q: Dual monitors with one above the other? I'm using Gnome 3 and proprietary Nvidia drivers. I have tried to set in nvidia-settings my external monitor to be \"above\" my main one (it's a laptop). However, when I try to drag a window up from the main display to the external one, it gets stuck and can't move past a certain point. Trying to maximize it changes its decoration so it looks maximized (i.e. no borders, etc), but its size or position doesn't change.\nNow, if I set my external monitor to be \"to the left\" of the main one, it works, which is why I'm suspecting this is a Gnome issue, not an Nvidia one.\nAnyone know how to fix this?\nUpdate: some versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome: 3.2.2.1\n\n*Nvidia: 280.13\n\n\nUpdate 2: I can see that Gnome 3.4 is out, and among the release notes is better external monitor support. However, they only mention a small fix that is unrelated to my problem. Can anyone with Gnome 3.4 and access to an external monitor please test this out and tell me if it works? I don't want to go through the hassle of upgrading my Ubuntu installation unless I know for certain it's going to fix the problem.\n\nA: I will conclude that this is a Gnome bug (which I have filed), since this works in Unity. Also, I have tried using the open source nouveau drivers (which properly support xrandr), and the same thing happens.\n\nA: have a similar setup and therefore issue here but:\nif I get to get the external (upper) monitor as main one with the top panel than everything works fine. The downside is the process how to get the upper monitor to be the main one. For me, it takes a couple of active/deactive apply reapply... actions in nvidia-settings tool. Have not found any determinism on that one.\nalso to mention, at work I have Intel hardware and multimonitor-support works without issues.\nthus it might be a gnome issue with how nvidia does its multimonitor-support?\n\nA: I've found a solution for it... disable sticky edges in displays settings\n", "Q: How to install the Ceton Infiniti PCIe digital cable tuner card? Can someone give instructions \"for dummies\" on installing the Ceton Infiniti PCIe digital cable tuner card in Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: I finally got this working, but I didn't (couldn't) use stock Ubuntu.  I'm going to write up what I did, but I'm going to put it as an addendum to the official talk page on MythTV.  You should be able to find it at the official page when I'm done.\nKey Points:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to get and build the drivers from Ceton.  They don't come in Ubuntu 12.04 either as a kernel module or add-on code in apt.  If you update your kernel, you will have to manually re-install the drivers.\n\n*You need to make sure your computer speaks to 192.168.200.1 over the ctn0 interface.  If you have no ctn0 interface, see the above bullet point.\n\n*I couldn't get this to work in MythTV 0.25; I had to use MythBuntu's add-on package to upgrade me to MythTV 0.26.  Then it worked.\n\n*You can't search for channels.  You'll need SchedulesDirect in the United States or something similar in your home country to get your appropriate channel list.  If you have a channel list, not searching for channels is perfectly fine.\n\n*You should use mplayer to test your CableCARD setup:\n\n\ncat /dev/ceton/ctn91xx_mpeg0_0 | mplayer -cache 8192 -\n\nA: Check out http://cetoncorp.com/infinitv_support/linux_drivers/.

System: Windows 7 64 - i5.\nWhat am I overlooking?  \n\nA: Is your audio setting for your Ubuntu guest virtual machine set to ICH AC97? \nICH AC97 is the only VirtualBox VM audio setting which allows me to get sound when running Ubuntu as a guest and either Windows or OS X (10.6.8) as the host. \nIn particular, if a VM's audio setting is Intel HD Audio then sound does not work in an Ubuntu 12.04 desktop guest.\nOn the other hand, sound will only work for a Windows 7 (64-bit) guest when the audio setting is Intel HD Audio. This can be rather annoying when you are working with a VM which dual boots either Ubuntu or Windows 7 as the guest OS.\nI have never investigated this further to find out why it works this way or if there is a way to work around it.

You can see some information on https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Block-list-syntax.html#Block-list-syntax \nAnd no, the MBR is not on /dev/sda1, this is on the beginning of the disk ( ie on /dev/sda, the first block ), and sda1 is the first partition.\nSo you should really check if this is not /dev/sda that you should use.

Under some circumstances, Shotwell shows no photo thumbnails while importing. \nI was trying to download some pictures from my camera (Canon EOS 400D) with Shotwell and the program didn't show any preview for the pictures before downloading them (it just shows a \"forbidden\" snapshot). After importing them everything seems fine.\nI've found this bug report but no solution is given for now. It seems there could be a solution for EOS cameras, according to the last comment. This guy links to a patch, but it's not downloadable. Any ideas of where to obtain a deb package of this patch or of any other solution?\n\nA: If you click on the \"Patch\" link you can then save the patch as a .diff file and apply it against trunk.\nYou can get a copy of gphoto's working trunk with\nsvn co https://gphoto.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gphoto gphoto\n\nApplying the patch is something akin to this command:\npatch -p1 < gphoto.diff\n\n(Note: I haven't actually tried this, but I believe it will work.)\n\nA: Sorry for the late answer. Since I didn't know how to use the svn trunks I simply downloaded libgphoto2 from the official sourceforge page. I changed manually the lines in library.c, just exactly as in the patch. However, after compiling it (doing the typical \"configure\", \"make\", \"sudo checkinstall\", and having downloaded lsusb-dev from repositories) it seems Ubuntu doesn't do anything when I connect the camera, so that I can't download the pictures. In any case, if I write lsusb in the terminal I get:\nBus 001 Device 004: ID 04a9:3110 Canon, Inc. EOS Digital Rebel XTi\n\nSo strictly speaking the OS detects the camera, but it does nothing.\nSince I was having this problem, I came with another solution. It's not as elegant as compiling it, but it worked. The idea is just to download the official Ubuntu 11.10 libgphoto2 package from here . Then in a terminal you just type:\nsudo dpkg -i libgphoto2-2_2.4.11-3_(architecture).deb  \n\nNow it is possible to see all the pics, although it is done in the \"old way\" (this version doesn't have the \"EOS fast directory\" enabled).\n", "Q: Android device is not recognized in adb I'm having a huge problem with my android samsung galaxy tab 7\".\nWhenever I try to connect it to my computer, instead of showing normally in my adb devices, the name of the device is : ????? and it status is online or device.\nI really don't know what is the problem, any help would be really appreciated.\nIf you need more info, I would be happy to give it.\nUbuntu : 11.04\nDevice : Samsung galaxy tab 7\"\nAndroid version : 3.2 HoneyComb\nI also added the rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules\n\nA: The '?' means that it can't determine the serial number , but adb may still work.

There are enough anecdotes involving Samsung devices to suggest that this is the problem. \nYou probably don't have adb over tcp/ip enabled but if you do turn that off.\nIf it says \"no permissions\", then that usually means a udev problem. If it works when you run adb as root then it is a problem with your udev rules: sudo /path/to/adb devices. One thing to watch out for with udev is that your computer needs to be rebooted for your changes to be recognised.\n\nA: Sometimes even with 51-android.rules, it may not work. I have the same problem, but adb  sees my phone just fine, except for that. I run a program called Qtadb, and everything's there, but the bootloader, and serial number.

Where should I be placing ubuntu-12.04-wubi-i386.tar.xz file so the wubi installer won't have to download that file anymore? Thank you.\nUpdate: I extracted the archive and there are two files, I'm afraid I do not know where to place them.\n\n\nA: You need to tell Wubi where the file is. Run wubi.exe as follows from the command line (e.g. if you placed the image in a folder called C:\\UbuntuImage):\nwubi.exe --dimagepath=C:\\UbuntuImage\\ubuntu-12.04-wubi-i386.tar.xz\n\nDon't extract the contents before running.\nPS I found it tripped over paths with spaces in them; if you find the same problem then move it to a folder as shown above.\nAdditional info\nYou can only install Ubuntu (32bit or 64bit) using the diskimage as shown above. If you want to install Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Edubuntu or Mythbuntu (or Xubuntu only on releases prior to 12.10) then you need to download the Desktop CD ISO and save it in the same folder as wubi.exe before running Wubi. Make sure that the ISO matches the release of wubi.exe and the flavour you are installing. \nNote that Wubi will check the ISO MD5 sum to ensure integrity (if you run it when connected to the internet). It will still use the downloaded ISO if it's valid. However, if you disconnect from the internet it only checks the kernel and initrd md5sums so you should always check the ISO yourself.\n\nA: Automatic dual boot for the Windows 8  or system based in i386, the answer is the same :\n\n\n*\n\n*download wubi.exe that you wish, and the i386.tar  and i386.iso files.\n\n*Open system terminal window (like ms-dos window)\n\n*Go to the folder using cd folder command and put\nwubi.exe --dimagepath=C:\\UbuntuImage\\ubuntu-1X.XX.XX-wubi-i386.tar.xz\n\n(the XX.XX.XX is the verion of ubuntu)\n\n*Select in the ubuntu window your disk patition, name and password.\n\n*and Reboot.\n\n\nA: Not the answer you want, but don't even bother with wubi. The ubuntu-in-windows is gonna take hdd space anyways, so you may as well install it on a proper partition instead of using wubi and risking windows messing it up. The Ubuntu Installer is very good, I find, and even setting up a dual boot is pretty painless with their installer.\n", "Q: How do I give proper attribution when distributing my modified Ambiance theme?

If I use dconf-editor to change the way permissions display (how to change permissions appearance in 12.04) and then bring up the file/folder properties of something in nautilus (e.g., right-click a folder and select properties > permissions), sometimes the boxes for permissions under the Permissions-Tab have dashes in them, like so:\n\nWhat do the dashes mean? I was expecting a checkmark/no-checkmark to signify enabled/disabled. But dashes?\n___________________________________________EDIT_________________________________________\nThey also do not appear to be an instance of \"Mixed States.\" For example, here is a screenshot of a folder that has one solitary file in it. Note the dashes under File Permissions:\n\nHere is a screenshot of the file persmissions of that solitary file:\n\nWhy is a folder with just one file in it showing the dashes if dashes mean mixed content?\n\nA: There a 3 states you will see when when selecting the permissions of files/folders in Nautilus. 2 of them will always show. The last one will only show if you select multiple files and a condition is met. Here are the states:\nAllow State (Checked) - You will typically see this state when selecting a single file. It means that that single file has allowed a Read, Write or Execute permission.\n\nDisallowed (Unchecked) - You will typically see this state when selecting a single file. It means that that single file has disallowed a Read, Write or Execute permission.\n\nMixed States (Some are Checked, Some are Unchecked) - You will ONLY see this state when selecting multiple files AND (Here is the condition I mentioned earlier) the multiple files selected do not have the same permissions assigned to them. For example, In this case, some files have allowed read permission, while others have not. Some have allowed write and execute permissions while others have not. You can change this by clicking the permission box which would disallow that permission then clicking it again to allow. This will affect all files selected (Assuming you are the owner). This state only shows when there are mixed allowed/disallowed states but this can only happen if you select multiple files/folders.\n\nUPDATE: With the added image that shows Folder and File permissions and with several tests I did on my PC I can say the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Nautilus File Properties are not being read correctly when selecting the parent folder. They will always by default show as Mixed.\n\n*You can change the permissions to all files and folders inside a parent folder (Which would change the permissions to all files/folders inside if you click on Apply to enclosed) but they would still show as mixed if you select the permission properties of the parent folder again.\n\n*Changing the file permissions in the Parent folder does change the permissions of the files/folders but again, it does not correctly detect them.\nWhat you have found in that particular part of Nautilus is a behaviour I find more related to a bug than to a normal way of operating. I should mention, this also affects the normal visual way (Default) of showing the Permissions, the file permissions are again, not shown by default, even if all permissions are the same for all the child elements.\nI have found several bugs indicating this is an old behaviour (Or related to it):\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/503315\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/822993\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/94512 \nThere might be others, that is just a quick look I did. In any case, I recommend creating a bug report or following one that exists related to this one. Note that it affects the visual way of changing permissions and your tweaked way of changing permissions (Apart from confusing the heck out of old and new users).\nHope this answers your doubts because it sure helped me figure this problem out.\n\nA: When I've seen the dashes in check boxes it always meant that it applied to more than one item, some checked and some not.\n", "Q: How to downgrade Oracle Java 7 to Java 6?

How can I divide an image horizontally (Or vertically) via Terminal or GUI.\nFor example I grab an Ubuntu Quantal image and tell a GUI or terminal program to divide the image in 5 equal parts horizontally.\n\nA: Install ImageMagick, and then use the command convert:\nconvert -crop 20%x100% rose.jpg rose2.jpg  \n\nExplanation:\n\n*\n\n*20% is 1/5 of 100% and therefore will crop the image in 5 equal parts.\n\n*100% so that it will not be cropped vertically.\n\n*rose.jpg is the original file.\n\n*rose2.jpg is the output.\n\n", "Q: How can I boot directly to Ubuntu after removing Windows from a dual boot? I just removed windows from my laptop completely. I will install it on virtual box.\nMy question is now, how and from where do I edit the boot options to boot directly in Ubuntu after I open my laptop without passing through the boot options page or if this is not possible, how do I remove the Windows boot line from there?\n\nA: You can edit grub to don't wait any second (instead of 10 seconds) and boot the first option in the menu:  \n1) Alt + F2 and paste gksu gedit /etc/default/grub \n2) Search for the line \"GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=10\" and change it to \"GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\" \n3) Open a terminal and paste: sudo update-grub \n", "Q: Single row of Workspaces with Unity 2d Using 12.04 with unity 2D I have the opposite problem to this question - how can I change from a 2x2 arrangement to having a single row of workspaces?\n\nA: Turns out the work-around listed to use gnome-panel does still work in 12.04. It appears to be only necessary to install gnome-panel:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-panel\n\nThe other packages listed are not needed. Once installed, its justs a matter of running gnome-panel on the cli, using its preferences to set the required layout and existing gnome-panel.\n", "Q: Is there a list of phones that will work with Ubuntu for Android Ubuntu for Android sounds intriguing and I am interested in checking it out but was wondering if anyone knows which phone/models have the necessary specs and available docks to work with it.\n** edit **\nAfter further searching it looks like Ubuntu for Android will primarily be pre-installed so it probably won't be the case of spec'ing out a phone and installing it like I originally thought.\n\nA: HTC Android smartphones/tablets (such as G2 Phone, Nexus One)\nI got this information only but the mobile devices which have the following specifications can deal with Ubuntu Android. \nDual-core 1 GHz CPU\nVideo acceleration: shared kernel driver with associated X driver; OpenGL, ES/EGL\nStorage: 2GB for OS disk image\nHDMI: video-out with secondary frame-buffer device\nUSB host mode\n512 MB RAM\n\nSo any phone which can meet those specifications can get Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Unallocated space, how to resize /home partition? I removed my Windows OS and now I want to resize my /home partition with that unallocated space. The main problem is that the free space is not under my sda4. How to move it there and then resize my /home partition?\nHere is my current partition layout:\n\n\nA: First, make sure that:\n\n\n*\n\n*All your documents and other important (i.e., hard to replace) files from all your partitions are backed up. Moving and resizing partitions dynamically carries with it a small risk of data loss (for example, if there is a power failure, if one of your filesystems is broken in a way GParted does not know how to detect, or if there is a bug in GParted), plus you could make a mistake and accidentally wipe something out.\n\n*You are running from a live CD/DVD or USB flash drive, rather than running GParted out of the installed Ubuntu system. It is unsafe (and would almost certainly not succeed) to dynamically move and resize partitions on the same physical disk as the OS you use to do it.\nProvided that this is taken care of, you have to perform four operations. It may take some time for GParted to perform them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Move /dev/sda3 (the remaining NTFS partition) all the way to the left. This moves the unallocated space to be between /dev/sda3 and /dev/sda4.\n\n*Move /dev/sda4 (the extended partition, which contains your other partitions) all the way to the left (it will be flush against /dev/sda3). This moves the unallocated space to be after /dev/sda4, at the end of the disk.\n\n*Expand /dev/sda4 to the right, so it takes up all the available space (i.e., expand it to the maximum allowed size). This eliminates the unallocated space, but creates space inside the extended partition that no logical partition is using.\n\n*Inside the extended partition (i.e., inside /dev/sda4), expand the logical partition /dev/sda7 (I assume that's your /home partition) to fill up all the available space on the right inside the extended partition. That is, expand /dev/sda7 to be as large as is allowed.\nAfter you tell GParted you want those operations to be done, you have to tell it to apply them (click the green check mark). It may take a while, but it should work without problems.\nNow no space is unallocated and the size of /dev/sda7 (your /home partition) is increased by (almost exactly) the size taken up by the unallocated space when you started.\nBy the way, if you decide you want to decrease the size of the remaining NTFS partition (/dev/sda3) to make more space for your installed Ubuntu system's /home partition, you can shrink /dev/sda3 (i.e., make it smaller on the right) between steps 1 and 2 above, or before step 1.\nThese changes shouldn't break the GRUB2 boot loader, and you should just be able to boot into your Ubuntu system afterwards. (Make sure to quit GParted and cleanly shut down / restart out of the live CD/DVD or live USB system.) However, in case there is a problem booting, you should be prepared to reinstall the GRUB2 boot loader to the Master Boot Record, to fix it. Fortunately, the same live CD/DVD or live USB system you use to run GParted can be used to reinstall GRUB2. See these methods. (You probably won't need to do this, though.)\n", "Q: Can I connect a media player to Ubuntu I want to switch 100% to Ubuntu from Windows. Of course I must have my Netflix account which I know won't work with Linux natively. My question is, can I connect a Roku box or another media player box to Ubuntu so that I can watch Netflix through Linux?\n\nA: Feeding a video stream from a Roku box into your computer would violate the DMCA and prolly get you sued by the RIAA. That's the bad news. The good news is you can run netflix in a modified wine environment. Check out How can I use Netflix on Ubuntu?\nYou could also get one of the newer monitors that accept multiple inputs and connect the Roku box to that.\n", "Q: Why does it take so long to start gvim? When I start gvim:\n$ date; /usr/bin/gvim; date\nTue May 29 10:45:45 CST 2012\n\n** (gvim:6030): WARNING **: Unable to create Ubuntu Menu Proxy: Timeout was reached\nTue May 29 10:46:11 CST 2012\n\nTo stop ubuntu menu proxy:\nexport UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0\n\nAnd test it again:\n$ date; /usr/bin/gvim; date\nTue May 29 10:46:47 CST 2012\nTue May 29 10:47:13 CST 2012\n\nNo warning. But it still takes 26 seconds to start gvim.  \nWhy it's so slow?

I added scim recently so that I could use chinese input. I have a little keyboard icon in my tray whose about box tells me is IBus 1.4.1. Selecting 'quit' off that same menu (so that the keyboard icon disappears) gives me instant gvim startup again. Starting ibus-daemon again (by \"ibus-daemon -d\"), I get the 26 second behaviour back.\n\nA: See How to get global application menu for gvim?\nIt seems that the upstream version has already fixed this problem.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I did the same steps as you, and the final missing piece was preventing ibus-daemon from starting, or killing it before I would use gvim:\nkillall ibus-daemon\n\n", "Q: 12.04 64bit will not install through a Live CD When I try to install the 64bit version of 12.04 through a Live CD, all that happens is that the disk spins, and I get the windows boot screen.\nI've set my BIOS to boot from a CD first, before booting from the hard drive, so the CD should work, but it just skips to windows.\nIve tried everything here, and nothing from it helped. Could something in my BIOS be interfering with the installation?\nI am using a Dell XPS 14z\nI would prefer not to use the 32bit version of Ubuntu because I want it to be at its full potential.\nI've tried downloading and burning to CD's multiple times to ensure that it's not corrupted. would you suggest one of these?\n\n*\n\n*Try to install an older version, like 11.10 64bit, and upgrading it?\n\n*Installing with a USB or external drive?\n\nIt's alright now, I used an External hard drive to install ubuntu and I also have 64 bit. Thanks for the input!\n\nA: If you downloaded the .iso file from ubuntu.com and burned it using the option \"write to disk\", selected from BIOS first boot your dvd-rw or whatever it is then everything should work.\n\nA: From your description, it seems not to be booting at all, which in a sense is a good sign. Usually problems that are very difficult to solve happen later in the boot process (or during the installation process...or on first boot of the installed system).\nYou should MD5 test the .iso image you downloaded (from which you burned the CD). If that doesn't check out, download it again and start over. If it does, see if you can get far enough to verify the installation media. (But your description makes it sound like you're not getting that far.)\nIf that doesn't work or reveals errors, make another install CD. Make sure you're burning the CD correctly. Burn it at the slowest possible speed, as that sometimes can produce a more reliable burn. You can also write the .iso image to a USB flash drive (as you suggested you might do), and try to boot and install from that.\nFinally, make sure you're booting from the CD (or flash drive) correctly. Your machine is a Dell, so you can press F12 when it first starts up, to bring up a boot menu letting you choose between different boot drives (including the CD and external USB drives). You may have to press F12 while it says to do so on the screen, which might be a very short window of time. You may have to try a couple of times to get it. (I'm guessing you are doing this part correctly, but I am including this section just in case, and for the benefit of other users with similar problems.)\n", "Q: 12.04 won't recognize my CD/DVD Drive CD/DVD drive is an IDE slave device, and my hard drive is the IDE master device.\nThe hard drive is located at /dev/sda1, but dev/sda2 can't be mounted.

The partitions on that drive are numbered starting with sda, such as sda1, sda2, etc.  \nThe CD/DVD drive is totally separate, with a name such as /dev/sr0.  It is usually mounted automatically in the /media directory when a disk is present, in a directory matching the name of the Disk.  On my system, the type is iso9660.\n", "Q: 12.04 unable to communicate with Router WRT310N I have a Sony Vaio VPCCB22FX running 12.04 and I'm trying to connect to my home router which is a Linksys WRT310N. \nThe connection is supposed to be OK. I connect to the router and I actually received an IP address correctly but I can't get into the Internet. I can't even ping my default gateway (Linksys Router). What could be the problem? \nThe router has connectivity to the Internet because I can use another computer and connect to that same router without problems. I can't ping my laptop from the router either. \nPlease, any ideas? I'm a Ubuntu newbie. Appreciate all the help.\n\nA: You can use command in terminal sudo -i then root password and another command pppoeconf and give your username and password provided by your ISP and enjoy Internet. \n", "Q: bash ignores what I type while \"apt-get\" is running I am encountering this problem:\nI type sudo apt-get install <package>, and hit Enter.  apt-get starts resolving dependencies and downloading/installing packages.  While it is running, I want to enter another command in the same terminal, so I type it (let's say echo done).\nThe problem is, I type echo done and Enter, but when apt-get finishes, the echo done is not executed.  The shell comes back to me with a prompt, and there is nothing in its input buffer.  So, bash seems to ignore my input while apt-get is running.  This \"ignoring\" doesn't seem to happen with any other command.\nI would like to figure out why this is happening, and if I can change the behaviour somehow.\n\nA: You might want to try to execute any command by adding in the very end of the command the &., e.g.: dolphin &. This way the process will run on the background and the terminal will be free to operate on.\nUpdate: it seems, however, that interactive processes, like sudo apt-get install <package> that expect a user input (for example sudo's password) just wait in the background. They can be re-reached with the command fg.\n", "Q: How can I boot into Windows after installing Ubuntu?

The guide to installing the Driver tool can be downloaded from here (it is the last one on the list, in PDF form).

Now the whole sudo is not working. If I try to update my system using this command:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nI get the following message:\nsudo: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so must be only be writable by owner\nsudo: fatal error, unable to load plugins\n\nSo I tried to change the folder permissions by opening Nautilus as root by using this command\ngksudo nautilus\n\nBut nothing happened. Nautilus didn't open. This is an emergency as the whole of sudo is not working. when I tried searching the solution from Google many suggested re-installation. I don't prefer re-installation. so is there any other solution?    \n\nA: There are actually two mechanisms set up in Ubuntu for performing administrative tasks. sudo is one of them, and it and its graphical frontends (like gksu and gksudo) are not going to work until you fix the permissions problem.\nThe other mechanism is PolicyKit. Depending on exactly what you have done to your file permissions, it's likely that you can still recover using PolicyKit to run commands as root.\nThe pkexec command will run any (nongraphical) command as root (provided that the user invoking it is an administrator on the system). pkexec is capable of running graphical commands (like nautilus) as root, too, but this is quite nontrivial, as you have to set up configuration files for them describing how they are supposed to be run and what they are supposed to be allowed to do. Therefore, you're best off using the command-line to fix this problem...at least to the point where sudo works again. (Then you can run gksu nautilus to get a root file browser, if you're more comfortable using that to edit file permissions recursively.)\nI don't know exactly what you did to your permissions, so it's hard for me to give you a specific pkexec command to run, to fix the problem. But you can rectify the specific problem that sudo is currently complaining about. It says:\nsudo: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so must be only be writable by owner\n\nSo remove group and other write permissions (while not modifying owner write permissions) for that file:\npkexec chmod go-w /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so\n\nThen you can see if sudo works (by running some innocuous command like sudo ls).\nIf you need to perform other operations on file permissions from the command-line with chmod, see man chmod.\n(By the way, here's another, related situation where it's handy to know about pkexec.)\nIf you have trouble getting pkexec to work for this, please feel free to comment here, and I'll try to render further assistance. But you should know that even if this method does not work, you shouldn't have to reinstall Ubuntu.\nInstead, you can fix the problem from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD or live USB system, because the live system will be functioning--sudo will work on it--and you can mount your Ubuntu partition and change the permissions that way.\nOr as a third option (as forestpiskie has suggested), you could use recovery mode.\n\nA: I would try booting into recovery mode and setting the permissions back to what they were.\nReboot - choose second item from menu to get to recovery mode.\n\nrecently I had to change the folder permissions of /usr folder\n\nWhat asked you to change permissions of the whole /usr folder?\n\nA: install Users And Groups using this\ngo to Manage Groups\nand add you to sudo group\n", "Q: Why won't strace/gdb attach to a process even though I'm root? \n*\n\n*I logged in as root but strace gives me this:\nroot@kyznecov-System:/home/kyznecov# ps -e | grep 111\n 3807 pts/2    00:00:00 111\n 3810 pts/2    00:00:00 111\nroot@kyznecov-System:/home/kyznecov# strace -p 3810\n\nattach: ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, ...): Operation not permitted\nCould not attach to process.

To check if this is the case, run:\ngrep TracerPid /proc/$THE_PID/status\nIf it is nonzero, that is the pid of an existing program that is already running a trace on that process.\n\nA: As izx has commented, this should only be able to happen due to a kernel bug. So anyone who can currently produce this problem--including and especially the original poster of this question--would be well-advised to report it as a bug by reading that page thoroughly and carefully, and then running ubuntu-bug linux on the affected machine. This should be reported against linux in Ubuntu, and not against a mainline (upstream) kernel, unless you can produce it on a mainline kernel (you'd have to have yama loaded).\nThe expected behavior in every version of Ubuntu starting with Ubuntu 10.10 is that process A cannot trace a running process B unless B is a direct child of A (or A runs as root). This is a security enhancement, which makes it so that a process that has been compromised by an attacker cannot use debugging facilities provided by the kernel to discover information from other processes. This is explained in the ptrace scope section of the Security Features community wiki page.\nThis restrictive behavior is the default but can be changed to allow a process A to trace any running process B that is run with the same user ID as process A's own. That is, you can configure your system to allow any of your processes to debug each other. This simplifies attaching debuggers to already-running processes.\nThe setting for this is exposed in by the /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope sysctl. 1 denotes the more restrictive behavior and 0 the less restrictive behavior. The setting can be read with:\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\n\nThe less restrictive (non-default) behavior can be set with:\necho 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\n\nAnd the more restrictive (default) behavior can be set (or set back) with:\necho 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\n\nNot only was the original poster of this question unable to attach an strace instance to a currently running process with ptrace-scope set to 0, but the original poster was then still unable to do so when running strace as root. It's hard to see how this could be anything but a bug--I strongly recommend reporting it as one.\nAt first, I had thought that I was able to reproduce the problem where a ptrace_scope setting of 0 is ignored and treated as though it is 1. But I no longer believe this is the case, as I have done all the same things again, and I cannot reproduce the problem. I have tested this on:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Lubuntu Precise amd64 physical machine I use daily as my main box.\n\n*A VirtualBox virtual machine running a Lubuntu Precise i386 (12.04) live CD.\n\n*An identical VirtualBox virtual machine running a Quantal i386 (Ubuntu+1) daily-live (20120608).\n\n\nOn all three machines, the expected behavior occurs, and I cannot reproduce the condition the original poster of this question is asking about. Here's some text from the Terminal (from the Precise live system):\nlubuntu@lubuntu:~$ nano&\n[1] 3492\nlubuntu@lubuntu:~$ strace -p 3492\nattach: ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, ...): Operation not permitted\nCould not attach to process.

A maximally inclusive search on https://bugs.launchpad.net (which includes any reported Ubuntu bugs) for the text ptrace_scope produces just a handful of results, in which clearly none are reports for this bug. Reporting the bug would help others, may lead to workarounds or a fix, and is probably the only meaningful way to proceed forward in working on this problem (assuming the problem is still occurring).\n", "Q: Password required but dialog won't let me type it On Ubuntu 2012.04 I open \"Connect to Hidden Wireless Network\", type the network name, click connect.

I am a Dvorak layout user and I am happy with the switch. \nI avoided the undo/cut/copy/paste shortcut disadvantage (the z,c,x and v are far apart on Dvorak layout) on Windows by using Microsoft's Keyboard layout creator to map control key combinations back to their QWERTY counterparts, but it's bugging me that I can't do the same on Ubuntu/Linux, even though it has a more advanced input framework.\ndvorak-querty is supposed to accomplish this but doesn't work for me.\nThe comments on the bugs referred to by a previous similar question doesn't provide any viable workaround for this.\nSo is there anything I can do aside waiting (for years) for the  bugs to be fixed, like writing a custom keyboard layout or ibus plugin?\nClarification (another way of putting my question)\nIs there any way to use QWERTY's keyboard shortcut position while the Dvorak layout is active? \nFor example, to 'Copy', I have to press Ctrl+i (the position of the 'I' on QWERTY is 'C' on Dvorak, which is a awkward stretch), then for 'Paste', I have to press Ctrl+. (another awkward position). I want to press Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v. \nCurrently I'm using the old-style shortcuts I learned from the DOS-era, Shift-Del for cut and Ctrl+Insert for copy... \n\nA: My first attempt was to make the control keys act simultaneously as Control and as a third-level chooser, then define a keyboard layout with Dvorak on levels 1 and 2, and Qwerty on levels 3 and 4. This doesn't seem possible in XKB, however. In addition, the comments in the source of the dvorak-qwerty program you've linked state that\n\nAlthough it is possible to define an XKB layout which implements Dvorak-Qwerty, doing so exposes a depressing number of bugs across the board in X apps.  Since it is the responsibility of each X app to interpret the keyboard layout itself, rather than having the X server do the work, different GUI frameworks actually tend to have different bugs that kick in when using such a layout. Fixing them all would be infeasible.\n\nYour best bet is probably to get the dvorak-qwerty hack working. Most of what I'm about to write you probably know. The source says to compile it with\ngcc xdq.c -o xdq -std=c99 -O2 -lX11\n\nthen run it with\n./xdq\n\nor give the absolute path so you can put it in your startup items.\nWhen I ran the program it gave me the following warning:\n\nFailed to grab 35 key combinations.\n  This is probably because some hotkeys are already grabbed by the system.\n  Unfortunately, these system-wide hotkeys cannot be automatically remapped by\n  this tool.  However, you can usually configure them manually.\n\nHowever, I tested it with ^W, ^Q, ^C, ^X, and ^V, and it worked as expected. If you want it to grab other modifiers (ALt+Ctrl and Super) the combinations the system is already using for other things, add -DXQD_GREEDY (not -DXDQ_GREEDY as the source says) to the compilation command.\nIf it failed to compile with the error\n\nxdq.c:87:22: fatal error: X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory\n  compilation terminated.\n\nthen you should install the package libx11-dev with\nsudo apt-get install libx11-dev\n\nIf this doesn't get the program working, let me know and we can try to work it out.\n\nA: tl;dr\nYou need to turn NumLock off.\nExplanation\ndvorak-querty works by \"grabbing\" (more like \"stealing\") keyboard combinations from other programs. Combinations that include certain modifiers (Control, Control+Shift, Alt and Alt+Shift) are stolen, \"qwerty'd\" and returned to the original program.\nThe problem is that those, and only those, are the only modifier combinations that are stolen. Other modifiers, such as CapsLock and NumLock, are not stolen.\nSo if you have NumLock active and hit Ctrl+C, dvorak-qwery will \"perceive\" NumLock+Ctrl+C and therefore not steal it.\nSo turn off any additional implicit modifiers that you see on your keyboard.\nAlternate solution\nIf you want to run dvorak-qwerty and enable NumLock at the same time, you might want to try my version of the code (check out Arguments)\n:)\n\nA: Many years later, I am still using AutoKey on X11, with individual key mappings.

I'm looking at buying a new laptop and considering buying one with a hybrid HDD/SSD drive.  Specifically I am looking at the new second generation Seagate Momentus XT.  For some reviews look here and here.\nThe caching is all done on the firmware level so there is no question that this basic functionality will work with Ubuntu.\nHowever, the second generation drives are supposed to now reserve space on the SSD for OS boot files.\nThe Seagate documentation describes it this way:\n\nBoot\n  Momentus XT drives are known for incredibly fast boot-up times,\n  and now they are even better with FAST Factor boot technology. This\n  system boot-up technique can reduce your boot time to mere seconds—for\n  a fast cold-boot start. It can cut your system start-up time by up to\n  65% over a traditional HDD. FAST Factor boot technology will deliver\n  the fastest boot possible, whether you boot your system once a day or\n  once a week. Your OS boot-up files are always there, ready to work.\n  (source)\n\nWhat concerns me is there is no additional information about this in the product manual and the reviews seem to suggest that the firmware might be looking for Windows boot files specifically.  See for example:\n\nDubbed FAST Factor Boot, this new approach aims to accelerate the\n  Windows boot process whether you're firing up the OS for the first\n  time or rebooting after months of uninterrupted activity. With the old\n  Momentus XT, Adaptive Memory needed a few boots to learn which\n  OS-related data to cache. Using the drive for long enough without\n  rebooting had the potential to push that data out of the cache,\n  reversing any previous boot-time benefits. With the new XT, a segment\n  of the NAND has been reserved solely for OS data related to the boot\n  process. That section of the flash is populated as Windows is\n  installed to the drive, which should speed things up starting from the\n  first boot. If Windows is being installed via a drive image, the XT\n  will need a couple of boots to determine what to put in the roped-off\n  section of its cache. As with clean installs, that data won't be\n  kicked out of the cache between boots.\n  (source)\n\nThe Seagate documentation mentions nothing about being specific to Windows OS boot files, so I'm wondering if the review is just being ignorant of there being OSes other than Window or if they are actually privy to some information that is not in the official documentation.\nAnyone have any ideas about this?\nSeagate's Response\n(I'm adding this into the question as I don't consider it a satisfactory answer--just more background for the question)\nI sent Seagate a message through the presale's email support form on their website asking about this.  I talked with two support agents, one via email and one via live chat.\nThe first agent was professional but not particularly helpful, responding with this email:\n\nHello Austin,\nThanks for contacting Seagate global support.\nWe do not test our drives for use with Linux. Sorry we cannot answer\n  your question in depth.\nRegards,\nAgent (taking names out) Seagate Global Customer Support\n\nI responded saying that I didn't need an answer based on performance proven through testing but rather just the expected behavior.  Another agent responded to my email but there was a mix-up and he actually sent me a link for a screen-sharing, which out of curiosity I boot up a Windows VM and followed.  The agent realized there was a mix up but was still willing to discuss my question in the screen-sharing softwares chat function.\nThis second agent was more helpful, but I got the feeling that He wasn't very knowledgeable about the product.  He said that Linux is not a supported OS but that it should be compatible with Linux.  When I asked for information specifically about the reserved space on the SSD for OS files, I just got another description of the basic features of the Momentus XT line, \"It caches frequently accessed files regardless of OS or software.\"  He had no information about the new \"FAST Factor Boot\" feature--and honestly, I wasn't even sure if he knew about the new feature at all.\nI asked him if he could email me a summary of our conversation to post on a website and he sent this:\n\nDear Austin,\nThank you for contacting Seagate.\nOfficially Linux is not supported, because it is an open source\n  Operating system.\nBy selectively tackling data that is frequently used and\n  time-consuming to fetch, the Momentus XT drive will copy this data\n  into the flash and maintain the relevancy. You get the instant\n  response experience you've been searching for.\nMomentus XT hybrid drives are designed to work in any standard laptop.\n  These drives are OS-, driver- and software-independent, making them\n  remarkably simple to integrate and easy to use.\nIf you have any additional questions you may call us during your\n  regional business hours listed below. For your convenience we also\n  have on-line chat assistance.\nLive Assistance: Chat: Americas:\n  http://support2.seagate.com/ChatLaunch?rc=1 Europe:\n  http://support2.seagate.com/ChatLaunch?rc=2\nRegards, (name removed) Seagate Global Customer Support\n\nSo in summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Confirmation of what we already knew (basic functionality is OS\nindependent)\n\n*No information at all about the new reserved space for boot files\n\n*A very weird statement (Officially Linux is not supported, because it is an open source Operating system.) about open source software that I assume/hope\nis not really Seagate's reason for not supporting Linux.\n\n\nI think to get a real answer we would need to talk with either a) someone who owns this drive and could test the boot performance, or b) somehow get through to a high-level support agent who is actually familiar with the product's features.  I'm considering contacting System 76, who have this drive as an option for their Ubuntu laptops and asking them if they've tested the boot performance (or if their OEM status can get more useful answers out of Seagate).  If people have twitter accounts (I don't) they could also start tweeting this question at Seagate (@askseagate) and see if it catches their attention.\n\nA: Is the drive firmware going to be able to read NTFS?\nUnless the drive can somehow read NTFS at a firmware level, and carries a predefined list of Windows \"boot file\" names , its behavior should be OS-agnostic. The firmware is going to be concerned with accesses at a physical-unit level, ie. the sector.\nSo, the firmware does know which sectors of the drive are accessed at \"boot-up\" (e.g., x seconds after startup) and with what frequency. It could perhaps then use that information to mark certain sectors (in its own non-volatile memory) as \"let these persist longer in the flash cache\", aka \"keep these in the 'roped-off' area\".\nQuoting from the StorageReview review linked by Mitch:\n\nFAST Factor also makes the Momentus XT OS independent, by keeping the software contained on the drive itself, there's no need for a driver,\n\n\nBased on my experience with the old (1st-gen) hybrid Momentus XT, it will work just fine with Linux, given a few boots/\"burn time\" to adapt.\n\nIf Windows is being installed via a drive image, the XT will need a couple of boots to determine what to put in the roped-off section of its cache.\n\nUbuntu Live-CD installs are essentially via a drive image - the squashfs filesystem used for the CD is expanded upon the partition being installed to. Thing is, Windows Vista/7 adopt the same strategy -- a giant 2GB install.wim image is expanded to the target hard disk.\nAssuming that the quoted statement means that XT2 will effectively behave like XT in such a scenario, it should work just as well with Ubuntu/Linux.\n\nTo better quantify the above assertion, let's look at numbers. The XT2 has an 8GB SSD component; this is much larger than a stock Ubuntu Desktop install, and roughly the size of a fresh Windows 7 install. Even assuming an image-based install, if all of it is cached in the SSD, it will start up pretty quickly the first time around.\n\nA: Seagate does not list Linux as one on the supported Operating Systems.  But they list Mac OS X.  I would think that if it works with Mac OS X, it will probably work with Linux, but that`s just a guess.  On the other hand, I would wait a while before buying this drive, just to see if any problems come up.  Hope that this will help you in your decision.\nIf you would like to see a review of the drive and technology, See this\nOn a personal note, and the fact that I have been in this industry over 27 years, I would wait before buying the drive, even if it works with Linux, at least for maybe a month or two.\n\nA: I don't have any truly new information pertaining to your core question. All I'm doing is providing you with a link to another review which I considered interesting.\nSeagate 2nd Gen Momentus XT (750GB) Hybrid Review by Anand Lal Shimpi on 12/13/2011\nThere is also a \"talking head\" video review on YouTube which is about 11' long. Tastes vary, but speaking for myself I found the video enjoyable. \nThe video review does not go into specifics about the drive's performance. Instead Anand gives an overview of the drive and how it works. Most of the video consists of his views on the economics of the hard drive commodity market, why the Momentus XT has only 8 GB of SSD, why SLC NAND is used, a possible evolutionary path the Momentus XT might follow, and where the drive is positioned relative to other storage.\nI enjoy Anand's reviews because I feel he focuses more on the actual technologies involved. He rarely just repeats the talking points from some marketeer's press release. Tech \"reviews\" all too often merely parrot back phrases like \"Fast Boot\" which provide more \"truthiness\" than insight. \nIn fact, I think he does not use Seagate's \"FAST Factor Boot\" market-speak anywhere in either his print or video review. To me it's as though he's implicitly saying, \"Why bother? If I can't say anything about how it works, then what value would mentioning it add?\")\nHis bottom line seems to be that he really likes the new Momentus XT, but it is essentially just a better version, an evolutionary improvement, of the original.\nHe also mentions that Seagate intended to upgrade the drive's firmware sometime in \"early 2012\". The update would allow the drive to use the SSD for write caching as well as read caching. Given that it is now June of 2012 that should already have happened.

All he says is: \n\n\"Still digging into FAST boot. If it works the way I think it works,\n  it should be able to cache boot data from multiple OSes. Will find out\n  for sure soon...\"\n\nIf he ever followed up on that with a more detailed review, I have not found it.\n\nA: I bought a computer with this harddrive and I can testify that this definitely works.\nUbuntu boots up just as fast if not faster than it resumes from suspend.  The BIOS post takes longer than the OS boot up--and thank goodness or I wouldn't have time to hit the keys to enter setup/select boot options.\nI multiboot and I''m still trying to see how it deals with three different OSes' boot files.  I'll update this answer once I have reached a conclusion.\n\nA: From comments to the Anandtech article Irrational John links:\n\nThe Momentus XT will learn multiple boot activities and retain the boot information for them in the boot partition. There should be no problem optimizing 2 or 3 different boot scenarios, but more than that may degrade the performance of the last first boot activity learned.\n\nSo it looks like it works like the recording half of ureadahead/e4rat/systemd-readahead and caches blocks that are accessed at boot time.  That means it's OS independent, and that one OS could push out the other's boot data after a few boots.\n", "Q: How can I change the language in the ProfileManager? My standard language for Firefox and Thunderbird is Dutch.\nWhen I use the terminal to open firefox or thunderbird with the -ProfileManager option, the resulting ProfileManager is in English.\nHow can I change the language to Dutch in the ProfileManager? \n\nA: You can download a fully localized version of Firefox here:\n  http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all.html\nand then extract that in e.g. /home/{yourusername}/programs/firefox/\nThen, create a directory /home/{yourusername}/bin/ and create a symbolic link \"firefox\" in that directory, pointing to /home/{yourusername}/programs/firefox/firefox.\nStarting from the next time you log in, all invocations of \"firefox\" (including through the system menus) should invoke your own localized version of Firefox instead of the Ubuntu-maintained version.\n(This is what I do, because I'm using a nightly build of Firefox instead of the Ubuntu-maintained version.)\n", "Q: How to stop bzr from using ssh (asking a password) for downloading?

I'd like to use the Compiz \"Scale Window Title Filter\" on 12.04.\nI've already read another answer which just said to install compiz-plugins-extra and enable \"Scale Window Title Filter\" in the ccsm. I've done this, but when entering scale mode (<super>+w or <shift>+<alt>+<up>) nothing happens when I type.\nI have tried restarting unity, logging out and even rebooting, but this behaviour remains the same.\nAm I missing something? How do I enable it? Has anyone got it working correctly on 12.04?\n\nA: This plugin requires the text plugin in order to draw text on screen.\nBe sure to have this plugin enabled too.\n\nA: Enabling the Scale Window Title Compiz filter in Unity 12.04\n1. What does the scale window title filter do?\n\n*\n\n*The Super+W shortcut shows you miniature (scaled) versions of all the windows in your current workspace, and you can click on any one of them to switch to it.\n\n\n\n*The somewhat oddly named scale window title filter allows you to type and filter windows out in the scaled view based on the titles of the windows. It's useful to narrow down things when you have many applications/windows open.\n2. How do I install it?\n\n*\n\n*You will need the Compiz Config Settings Manager (ccsm) and some extra Compiz plugins. Open up the Software Center, search for (a) \"compizconfig\" and (b) \"compiz-plugins-extra\" and install those packages (see screenshots below). (Those who prefer apt-get can install the packages compizconfig-settings-manager and compiz-plugins-extra instead)\n\n\n\n\n*Close the Software Center.\n\n3. How do I activate it?\n\nStatutory Warning: Compiz Config Settings Manager is an advanced tool and one tiny mistake, typo or an accidental click of the mouse can leave your desktop unusable, requiring time and effort to fix it. Please be very careful and follow instructions...thanks. If you mess up, please see this answer on how to fix things.\n\n\n*\n\n*CCSM can become unstable and crash if you try changing settings with multiple windows open. I highly recommend you close all running applications before trying this.\n\n\n*Start CCSM from the Dash by typing \"compiz\" and clicking on its icon:\n\n\n\n*Type \"title\" in CCSM's Filter box to see the \"Scale Window Title Filter\" appear on the right side (see screenshot below). Click on the checkbox next to it, and it will be highlighted orange. You may get a popup asking to also enable the \"Text\" filter -- click OK if that happens. Close CCSM.\n\n\n4. How do I use the scale window title functionality?\n\n*\n\n*In this example, we'll use a workspace with six windows: two Terminals, one Firefox, one Writer, one Software Center and one System Settings.\n\n\n*Press Super+W to bring up the scaled windows:\n\n\n\n*Typing one letter s reduces the windows shown from six to the four that have s in their titles: Software Center, System Settings and the two terminals (because my machine has \"precise\" in its name):\n\n\n\n*Typing something unique to the title of an application -- my username izx -- reduces the windows to the two terminals:\n\n\n\n*Similarly, wri for Writer shows you just that window, nearly maximized.\n\n\n\n*Click on any window at any point to bring it to the front.\n\n\n*As you Backspace out while typing, the view is adjusted to match.\n\n\n*You can clear the filter and go back to the unfiltered full view by pressing Esc at any time.\n\n5. What settings can I customize for this filter?\n\n*\n\n*Start CCSM again (be careful!), filter for \"title\" and click on the \"Scale Window Title Filter\" to bring up its settings. Exce\n\n\n*Under \"Behaviour\" (best left untouched) you can set the:\n\n*\n\n*Filter timeout in seconds (if you haven't typed in this much time, text will be cleared and you will go back to the unfiltered scaled view)\n\n*Case-sensitivity of the filter\n\n*Whether the typed text is shown on the screen\n\n\n\n\n*Under \"Appearance\", you can adjust:\n\n*\n\n*Whether the filter text is bolded or not\n\n*The font size (larger may help on a high-resolution display)\n\n*The title border size (the border around the filtered text)\n\n*The font color (and opacity)\n\n*The background/border color (and opacity)\n\n\n6. I don't like it! How do I disable it?\n\n*\n\n*Start CCSM, filter with \"title\" and simply uncheck the \"Scale Window Title filter\" checkbox. Again, this is best done with no other applications open.\n\n\nSources: Compiz Wiki\n\nA: You should also have installed compiz-plugins-main, that is not installed by default nor for dependency. Anyway, i've the following packages installed, and works for me:\n\n\nA: I now have this working and I am answering it myself because no other answer exactly got it.\nIt turns out that I had been running ccsm from a shell. I instead launched it from the dash and then the plugins I selected were enabled without me having to log out or anything. Scale Window Title Filter now works.\nThanks to Lorem for sending me in the right direction, as by trying it with a new user account I saw that it would work and it was just something wrong with my user's configuration. I don't know why running ccsm from a shell is wrong or where those settings go, but clearly it is not to the right place.\n\nA: Scale Window Title Filter is part of the compiz-plugins-extra package.\nInstall this package:\nsudo apt-get install compiz-plugins-extra\n\nAnd then Scale Window Title Filter will show up as a plugin in CompizConfig Settings Manager.\nIn CCSM you can set the keyboard shortcut for Scale to be a toggle (\"Key bindings toggle Scale mode\" under Scale settings), or you can set Scale to be activated by for example dragging the mouse to a screen corner, and use that instead.\n", "Q: Promoting an app in the Ubuntu Software Center through a ratings and reviews API As an app author, I would like to promote my app in Ubuntu.

I haven't tested the following, but here's a starting point:\nTar script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nlockdir=/tmp/myscript.lock\n\nif mkdir \"$lockdir\"\nthen    # directory did not exist, but was created successfully\n    echo >&2 \"successfully acquired lock: $lockdir\"\n    trap 'rm -rf \"$lockdir\"' 0    # remove directory when script finishes\n    # continue script\nelse\n    echo >&2 \"cannot acquire lock, giving up on $lockdir\"\n    exit 0\nfi\n\n# DO YOUR ORIGINAL TAR SCRIPT HERE\n\nReboot script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nlockdir=/tmp/myscript.lock\n\nwhile true; do\n    if mkdir \"$lockdir\"\n    then    # directory did not exist, but was created successfully\n        trap 'rm -rf \"$lockdir\"' 0    # remove directory when script finishes\n        break    # continue with script\n    else\n        sleep 5  # sleep for 5 seconds and try again\n    fi\ndone\n\n# RUN YOUR REBOOT COMMANDS HERE\n\n\nA: I would use polling technique for the pid of that script. Basic idea is wait until the script releases the PID  (meaning it has exited), and only then go to the next step in the reboot script. And of course if no process is running, the script will go on to reboot.\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile pgrep -f my_backup_script_name.sh > /dev/null\ndo \n  sleep 0.25  # small delay so that the loop doesn't hog the CPU\ndone\nshutdown -r now\n\n", "Q: desktop doesn't load after messing with gtk So I guess I majorly screwed up.\nIn order to install gimp 2.8 I had to upgrade gtk.

shutting down and booting again mind you) - and now the mouse registers fine with the extra buttons (they're btn 10 and 11).\nI've had a similar thing happen to my touchpad on my laptop (where it behaved differently after rebooting from windows - though not for the better in that situation). I think the rationale were that there must've been some kind of ram/rom in the hardware which stored some driver specific stuff and which didn't get cleared properly on a reboot.\nI have no idea if this would help anyone, but now it's documented.\n\nA: Fortunately, the config is configurable via the firmware in the mouse. Connect the mouse to any Windows 7 PC. Download SteelSeries Engine for Windows, disable the page up and page down buttons. Reconnect the mouse to your Ubuntu.\n\nA: The issue appears to have been resolved as of the 3.7.x kernel (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=139994), so you should have a working mouse when 13.04 ships.\n\nA: I don't have a fix, but I might have a hint as to what's happening.\nI have the same mouse, and the same problem, and I suspect a kernel bug somewhere in the USB subsystem.  Using kernel 3.2.0 (Debian-unstable), and following the usbmon documentation:\n# mount -t debugfs none_debugfs /sys/kernel/debug\n# modprobe usbmon\n# grep -B5 SteelSeries /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices\nT:  Bus=03 ...\n...\n# cat /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon/3u\n\nNow I should be seeing a trace of everything happening on USB bus 3.  And indeed, when I move the mouse, I see lines like:\nee561cc0 3981940473 C Ii:3:016:1 0:1 8 = 01000000 ffff0000\nee561cc0 3981940545 S Ii:3:016:1 -115:1 8 <\n\nBut when I click one of those right-side mouse buttons, I get nothing.  And then I don't get any data when I move the mouse anymore.  Which I can only assume means the USB driver went Wat.\nI'd wonder about the mouse (and still do, a little), but both OSX and (I assume) Windows handle it just fine.\n\nA: Ditto. Except that disabling it in Windows only seems to temporarily fix the problem--it resurfaces if the mouse is reconnected. Which, interestingly, seems to then persist until I next visit Windows. I should probably stop plugging it into my monitor. \nI also tried the 3.4 kernel from the kernel PPA to no effect.\nAfter some searching about for this error and fixes for input devices that flake out in Linux, I've found a few things to try out. Alas they tend to require a kernel rebuild which I've not done lately outside of easy monolithic bzImage situations. And so I'll share them here until I investigate Ubuntu's convenient module rebuilding facilities: \nThere is a file in USB core called quirks.c which implements workarounds for some misbehaving devices:\nOur mouse isn't one of them. But perhaps one of those tweaks would help? They're documented in the header.\nAlternatively, there is a HID_MAX_USAGES constant in hid.h that was exceeded by some devices.\nIn one case where that was the fix, it was also observed the mouse offered multiple interfaces. Our mouse does too, check lsusb -v and search for Ideazon (which is SteelSeries parent company/manufacturer/what they're called in USB land). Maybe we can just blacklist that part somehow?\n\nA: Ok it's more of a work around than a solution, but as @skomorokh said, disable the buttons in Windows, and then save the setting in a new profile and store it on the mouse to avoid losing the configuration when unplugging the mouse.\n", "Q: How to backup programs without using apt cache?

On my pc, I'm using PCSX Reloaded - the best PS1 emulators for Linux I found so far.\nBut I'm having a little issue on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise. I'm using Unity 3D and I'm trying to run some of my original PS1 games on PCSX Reloaded. Everything works nicely, except for fullscreen. I toggle fullscreen and specify maximum resolution for my monitor, but on fullscreen mode, both left and top unity bars aren't getting hidden.\nI tried changing between other graphic modes like Gnome Classic and Gnome Classic w/o Effects. On both, PCSX shows bars in fullscreen mode, so it isn't an Unity-specific issue, but an emulator problem.\nIt's a bit annoying play games this way, so basically I'm running games on window mode for now. I'm using default OpenGL graphic plugin on this emulator. I tried changing to X11 graphic plugin and fullscreen worked, but graphics on X11 plugin aren't as good as OpenGL one.\nAnyone know a way to get fullscreen working on PCSX using OpenGL plugin? Or maybe another graphic plugin w/ OpenGL support.\n\nA: This is a commpatibility issue.\nYou can try by changing the graphic plug in in pcsx\n\nA: this sounds a bit complicated, i have a note book and run just fine, i set up full screen by changing the resolution on settings, the only thing you have to understand is that the psone resolution has to be kept as the games where made for that resolution. my unity launcher hide perfectly when i run the game.\ntry changing resolution, without stretching the image (keeping original psone) and run the bios right after, try till yours work.\nwish you luck!!!  \n\nA: If you installed though synaptic, you should have a second GPU plugin pre-installed (XVideo Driver 1.1.17). \nSwitch to it in the configure menu.

Return to email, paste snippet, back to editor, close editor.\nI can't figure out if there is a way to prevent Gedit (and/or Kate) from clearing the clipboard, or how else to avoid step 4b which seems a rather roundabout way to work around an unintuitive behaviour.\nHelp?\nPS. Apologies, I know that this is not directly related to Ubuntu, but my Google-fu is weak and I don't know where else I'll find an expertly answer (or any answer at all, seriously, how do you search for something like that?). Right now, I'm on Linux Mint 11 LXDE, but I've suffered from the same on stock Ubuntu and Kubuntu as well.\nPPS. To me this behaviour seems very unnatural, but I see it here and there in Linux: also in the KDE screenshot tool (substitute \"image\" for \"snippet\" and \"image editor\" for \"email\"). Is it really just me?\n\nA: The Ubuntu wiki on Clipboard Persistence suggests that what I'm seeing is a bug but at the same time the intended behaviour. I am now using Parcellite to make things work for me. Thank you for your suggestion.\n\nA: Another option is Klipper. It stores your clipboard entries, and allows you to search them.

You can, with Klipper.\n", "Q: Cursor only moving horizontally on a macbook 6.2 with Ubuntu 12.04 After installing Ubuntu 12.04 on a Macbook pro 6.2, the touchpad and external USB mouse worked perfectly. After restarting the system, I can't get either touchpad or external USB mouse to work. Sometimes there is no cursor, but more often I can only move the cursor horizontally ⅚ of the way across the monitor from the top left. I have uninstalled mouseemu. xinpu list shows the USB mouse. xinput query-state for the USB mouse shows the following:\n\nButtonClass\n    button[1]=up\n    ...\n    button[16]=up\nValuatorClass Mode=Relative Proximity=In\n    valuator[0]=480\n    valuator[1]=2400\n    valuator[2]=0\n    valuator[3]=3\n\nand re-issuing this command with the pointer at its right hand extreme displays the same except for:\n\n    valuator[0]=1679\n\nSo the valuator[0] seems to be the x-coordinate of the cursor and the range of motion 480-1679 is indeed about ⅚ of the display width (1440). But valuator[1] is suspiciously large given the display height is 900. Perhaps this is a side-effect of having previously been using a dual monitor although booting with that monitor connected does not help.\nThere are other entries listed under xinput list:\n\n\n*\n\n*Virtual core XTEST pointer which seems stuck at position (840,1050).\n\n*bcm5974 which seems stuck at position (837,6700).\n\n\nRemoving the bcm5974 module using rmmod disables the touchpad as expected but does not fix the USB mouse problem.

For example, in FreeBSD, the order is bottom-up!\nIf the scripts depend on each other, best to call them in sequence, one from the other, or from a \"master\" wrapper script, which is the only one cron actually executes.\n", "Q: Boot error > no such device: grub rescue After an installation of Ubuntu 12.04, erasing an old partition with Ubuntu 10.10, I can't get grub to load.

How can I check and fix this? \n\nA: I had the same problem while upgrading 10.10 to 12.04 on an ASUS EEEPC.\nPreviously, I had / mounted on the 4GB disk and /home on the 12GB disk.  The latest Ubuntu needs at least 4.8GB in /, so I needed to swap the mount points.\nI fixed the problem by changing the hard-disk boot sequence in my BIOS settings.\n\nA: Re-install your GRUB.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot using a live cd of ubuntu.\n\n*Open a terminal and run the command\nsudo fdisk -l\nIt lists the complete partition table of the hard disk. In there, identify which partition you have got your linux installed on. You can identify it using the drive size you had allocated for it and looking at the last column of the output which will be extended or Linux for all of your linux partitions. The partition will most probably be something like /dev/sda5 or something. Remember this partition.  \n\n*Create a temporary folder in your home directory (Note: You can make the temporary folder anywhere you want. I’m using the home folder just for the sake of explanation). I’m calling it temp for now. So that temp folder’s path will be/home/ubuntu/temp`.  \n\n*Mount your linux partition there. That is, assuming that you found your linux partition to be /dev/sda5, you mount that at the temp folder by doing the following command  \nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /home/ubuntu/temp \n\n*If you want to check whether you have mounted the correct partition, go to your home folder and open temp. You will be in the / directory. In there you will find home, in which your home folder’s name will be there. Once you’ve confirmed you have mounted the correct partition, do step 6.\n\n*You have to install grub by showing the system where to read the data from the hard disk at the beginning. Don’t worry, just run the following command\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/home/ubuntu/temp /dev/sda\nThe /dev/sda corresponds to your hard disk name. Replace it by whatever the command sudo fdisk -l command showed you.\n\n*You’re done. You may restart your system.\n\nA: I had this same problem when I created my /boot as a RAID 1 mirror on Mint 13.\nSolved, by using the install CD to boot back into the system. Then re-mount my drives and chroot into the installed system:\napt-get install mdadm lvm2\n\nNot sure if this is really needed but I then did:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\ngrub-install /dev/sdb\nupdate-grub\n\n", "Q: How do I change the color of the Unity upper panel? I was looking for this for a long time but I couldn't find anything. Please tell me how to change the color of Unity's menu bar if it is possible.\nNot the left panel (launcher), I mean the panel on the top of the Unity desktop.\n\nA: Method 1\nThe top panel (for which the proper term is \"menu bar\") in Unity gets its theme from the currently set GTK+3 theme. Notice that depending on whether you select Ambiance or Radiance the color of the menu bar changes to match your window titlebars. So, one option is to simply find, install, and select a different GTK+3 theme. However, this also changes the theme for the rest of your desktop.\nMethod 2\nAn alternate solution you may try requires a little bit of work, but could potentially give you a lot of control over how the end result looks. The following method describes how to change the appearance of the menu bar by making it transparent and modifying your wallpaper to get the look you want:\n\n*\n\n*Change your menu bar opacity using the configuration tool of your choice. You can do this using CCSM if you're brave enough, or you can use a safer alternative. In this example, I'm using Ubuntu Tweak. Once Ubuntu Tweak is installed, click the Tweaks button in the toolbar, and select Unity under the Desktop category. Look for an option near the bottom for \"Panel opacity\", and turn it down; the lower, the better.\n\nNote: if you turn the panel opacity all the way down to 0.00, you will should get the best effect (i.e. complete transparency) needed for the rest of these steps, but you run the risk of running into this bug, which will turn your global menu text an ugly black color until you increase the opacity again. If you encounter this bug, please mark yourself as affected there.\n\n\n\n\n*Create a panel background of your choice. There's many ways you can do this (and the next step) using the image editing software of your choice. (My personal recommendation is GIMP, though it has a bit of a learning curve.) You'll want your panel background to be 24px high (the height of the menu bar), and as wide as your display in pixels. If you desire, you can find a pre-made panel background online instead and skip to the next step.\n\nTip: If you are unsure what resolution your display is for this step or the next, you can easily check by clicking the Displays... option under the power cog in the top-right corner of your screen and looking at what is currently selected under Resolution.\n\n\n\n*Get a wallpaper that is the same size as your display and overlay the panel background at the top. The idea here is to create a new wallpaper which will fit your display in such a way that you can see your custom panel background right along the top of the screen underneath the menu bar, giving the appearance that the menu bar actually looks like that. Again, feel free to use the image software of your choice.\n\n\n*Set your customized wallpaper as your new desktop background. You can change your desktop background under Appearance > Look in System Settings by either going through the power cog or by right-clicking your desktop and choosing \"Change Desktop Background\" from the menu. Alternatively, you can simply double-click your newly-created background file in your file manager to open it in Image Viewer and select Image > Set as Desktop Background from the global menu or HUD.\n\nA: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:shimmerproject/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gtk-theme-config\n\n\n", "Q: Can a directory belong to more than one group?

I am attempting to install Ubuntu on a box which was previously running Windows 7.\nI have also experienced the dreaded \"Unable to install GRUB\" error.\nI am not attempting to dual boot. I have previously run a Windows boot disk and removed all existing partitions.\nIf I run the Ubuntu 12.04 install CD and click install after the config screens, I get the error   Executing 'grub-install /dev/sda' failed. This is a fatal error.\n(It is the same error as this question: Unable to install GRUB)\nAll the questions I've read while looking for a solution are related to dual boot.  I'm not interested in dual boot, I'm after a clean out the box Ubuntu install. How can I achieve this?\n(For my sanity, please use very simple instructions when responding. I don't claim to have any talent either for linux or as a sysadmin)\n\nAdditional details copied from comments dated: 2012-05-29 ~15:19Z\nAfter booting from the CD, clicking Try Ubuntu, and then sudo fdisk /dev/sda I get\nfdisk: unable to seek on /dev/sda: Invalid argument\nsudo fdisk /dev/sdb gives \nDevice contains neither a valid DOS partiion table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel. \nBuilding a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x15228d1d. \nChanges will remain in memory only until you decide to write them. \nAfter that of course, the previous content won't be recoverable. \nWarning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite). \nCommand (m for help):\n\nI should add the Live CD desktop is graphically bad. I've got missing parts of programs and the terminal occasionally reflects to the bottom of the screen. But I can't imagine this is related.\n\nA: My understanding from your comments to @harisibrahimkv are that when you run the command sudo fdisk /dev/sda in a terminal window, you get the message fdisk: unable to seek on /dev/sda: Invalid argument. I would not expect to see this and it makes me wonder if there is a problem with your computer's hard drive. \nWould you please post more information about your hardware? You could do this by booting into Try Ubuntu with your install CD and then adding the output from the two commands below to your question. \nsudo lshw -short\nsudo lshw -class disk -class storage\n\n\nNote:\n  You can select text in a terminal window using either the left mouse button\n  or by pressing Alt+E while the terminal window\n  is active and using the Select All entry in the terminal's Edit\n  menu. \nAfter selecting the text either the keyboard shortcut\n  ShiftCtrl+C or the Copy entry in\n  the terminal window's Edit menu will copy to the clipboard.\nYou can then add this to your question by using the LiveCD's Firefox\n  browser to edit it and then pasting the command output  into the\n  question's edit window in the browser.\n\nPlease do not use comments to add the output from the commands. Comments are not intended\n  to be used that way.\n\nIf you are experiencing problems with graphics, then I suggest you first verify that your install media (CD) is OK. You can do this by running the Check disc for defects menu option from the Ubuntu CD Advanced Welcome Page Options. \nTo display this menu, press any key after booting your install CD and while the Ubuntu \"small logo\"  is displayed at the bottom of your screen.\nIf your install CD is valid, and therefore not the source of the graphics errors you are seeing, then you might want to try installing using the Ubuntu alternate install CD. The alternate install CD is not a \"LiveCD\". It performs a text based install which avoids potential problems with graphics drivers. It also contains some hardware drivers which are missing from the standard LiveCD.\nYou can get the alternate install CD ISO image from the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS releases page. If your hardware is old then you probably want to use the 32-bit version, ubuntu-12.04-alternate-i386.iso \n\nA: I had this same problem earlier today when trying to clean install from a USB drive. I burned the ISO to a disc and did a clean install from there and it worked fine. I know that doesn't really solve the problem but it might prove to be a quick fix if that's all you're after.\n\nA: I had the same issue.\nSolved it by first clicking on the 'Try Ubuntu' button and then on the 'Install Ubuntu' desktop shortcut.\n\nA: I think it might have messed up your hard disk name. Do try reinstalling GRUB.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot using a live CD of Ubuntu.\n\n*Open a terminal and run the command\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIt lists the complete partition table of the hard disk. In there, identify which partition you have got your linux installed on. You can identify it using the drive size you had allocated for it and looking at the last column of the output which will be ‘extended’ for all of your linux partitions. The partition will most probably be something like /dev/sda5 or something. Remember this partition.\n\n*Create a temporary folder in your home directory (Note: You can make the temporary folder anywhere you want. I’m using the home folder just for the sake of explanation). I’m calling it ‘temp’ for now. So that ‘temp’ folder’s path will be /home/ubuntu/temp.\n\n*Mount your linux partition there. That is, assuming that you found your linux partition to be /dev/sda5, you mount that at the ‘temp’ folder by doing the following command\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /home/ubuntu/temp\n\n\n*If you want to check whether you have mounted the correct partition, go to your home folder and open temp. You will be in the / directory. In there you will find ‘home’, in which your home folder’s name will be there. Once you’ve confirmed you have mounted the correct partition, do step 6.\n\n*You have to install grub by showing the system where to read the data from the hard disk at the beginning. Don’t worry, just run the following command\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/home/ubuntu/temp /dev/sda\n\nThe /dev/sda corresponds to your hard disk name. Replace it by whatever the command sudo fdisk -l command showed you.\n\n*You’re done. You may restart your system.\n\nA: This may sound silly but if you had an mdadm array the partitions may have gotten messed up.  Because of mdadm arrays running your partition table will be empty despite the install succeeding (the kernel itself knows the partitions but grub does not understand what to do naturally).\nI know this because I broke to the shell and chrooted into /target and ran grub-install and it mentioned something about a missing disk (an fdisk -l /dev/sda showed an empty partition table!).\nReinstalling or recreating a correct partition table will allow the grub-install /dev/sda to succeed after.\n", "Q: Cron job fails for any time other than default * * * * * On Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot), my cron job run fine if I use the default\n* * * * *\nBut if I want it to run at 17 hrs or any other time, it never runs. My settings are:\n00 17 * * * wget http://www.abc.com/a.php\n\nI also tried:\n00 17 * * * root wget http://www.abc.com/a.php\n\nI also tried specifying the path. There is a carriage return, and I'm logged in as root\nHere is my complete crontab:\nTZ=Australia/Sydney\n22 7 * * * /usr/bin/wget http://www.abc.com/a.php\n22 7 * * * /bin/date >> /tmp/date.txt\n\n----the out put is as follws:\nroot@Scrunch:~# sudo crontab -l -u root\n55 12 * * * date >>/tmp/crontest.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nroot@Scrunch:~# \n\nWhy is the terminal displaying so many blank lines after outputting the crontab entries? do you suspect unnecessary carriage lines are given....And i have not given any entries any other cron spaces like .d,/daily eyc.,\n\nA: Use only one zero for the minute. It is also usually a good idea when creating cron jobs to use the full path of the command you are using. This is because cron jobs run in a special very limited shell environment, and your path may differ from what you use when logged in. If you don't know it, you can easily find it out with the which command:\nwhich wget\n\nAnother thing, the last command root wget http://www.abc.com/a.php, is incorrect. root is not a valid command. I am guessing you meant to use sudo. This would be unnecessary if you are running the cron job as root, i.e.\nsudo crontab -e\n\n\nA: if your cron job definition is invalid, this will be logged in /var/log/syslog. What I usually do is set the cron job to run 2 minutes from now, then tail -f /var/log/syslog and ensure that things run as expected.\nIf there are no errors logged in /var/log/syslog, but the command failed to run (or even it it succeeded), cron will email you the console output from the command run. If you're not receiving these emails (you can look in /var/spool/mail/root) then something else is going wrong. I notice you're not using the -Q switch to wget, so you should get email every time it runs.\nFinally, the 6th field (where you put root in your third example) is valid only on the system crontab file (/etc/crontab or any of the /etc/cron.{d,hourly,daily,weekly,monthly} fragment directories. It's not valid on a user's crontab (which seems to be what you're using).\nI did the following to validate that things work correctly in principle, you may want to follow this procedure to at least ensure we're doing things the same way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Become root (I usually do sudo -i). This is because you're saying you want to do this as root.\n\n*crontab -e. You'll be put in an editor to edit the crontab file.\n\n*Add the following line (adjust to local time so it runs in the next 3 minutes. Give yourself some time to finish typing and save the file).\n05 10 * * * date >>/tmp/crontest.txt\n\n*Delete or comment out everything else in the crontab file.\n\n*Save the file and exit the editor\n\n*Confirm that the cron was correctly installed by running crontab -l\n\n*Wait until the configured time\n\n*confirm a line like this appears in /var/log/syslog:\n\n\nMay 30 10:05:01 snowflake CRON[4170]: (root) CMD (date >>/tmp/crontest.txt)\nFinally confirm that /tmp/crontest.txt was created and contains the scheduled time/date.\nCron has been in Unix/Linux for ages, it's tested and reliable, so what you're experiencing is not a bug, and you seem to be doing things right, so there must be something else that's affecting its functioning correctly. Hopefully we can determine what it is with some diagnostic procedures :)\n", "Q: How to install Windows Media Encoder 9 series I want to install Windows Media Encoder 9 series on Ubuntu, but wine is not running the .exe file.\nA popup says, \n\nThis version of Windows Media Encoder can only be installed on a computer running Microsoft Windows XP\n\nI also used this command but it didn't work:\nsudo apt-get install wmencoder\n\nHow can I do it?\n\nA: I believe you either need to tell Wine to emulate a Windows XP environment, or deal with having to get Windows.  This is a common occurrence among my friends, where they install windows software on linux, but then can't use it because of problems with it not being XP.\n\nA: Windows Media Encoder 9 was developed for Windows, not Linux. I tried to install the application using Wine, and the installer ran, but the main program would not run. I also tried looking for cscript.exe, the script that was supposed to come with the program to encode things via command line, but I could not find it.\nUnless you can install the program, and find cscript.exe and use that (and you might run into trouble running it even if you do find it), you'll have to stick to Linux alternatives such as FFmpeg.\n\nA: Sorry to tell you but WME9 does not yet work on Wine.

Usually if you mount a partition with a common filesystem type using mount, it will auto-detect the partition type.\nThe fact that it isn't auto-detecting it in this case could signal a few possibilities.\n\n*\n\n*You haven't installed filesystem tools for the chosen filesystem.  If you did a standard desktop install of Ubuntu, this shouldn't normally be a problem.\nFor example, to mount ntfs drives in recent versions of Ubuntu you need the ntfs-3g package.\n\n\n*You selected the wrong partition.\n\n\n*The partition is corrupt or unformatted.  In this case, you should probably do a filesystem check (fsck) on it before mounting it.  You may then want to proceed to mount it manually, specifying the filesystem type, as read-only.  If all else fails you may need special recovery software such as testdisk photorec.\n\nA: Please use parted -l to check the partition type and make sure you are mounting an actual data partition with known partition types (for example, ntfs, fat, etc).\nHere is what you would see from an 8TB drive, the first partition is not the actual data partition and instead, you should mount the second partition, which is the actual data partition.\nModel: TRUSTED Mass Storage (scsi)\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 8796GB\n\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\n\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                          Flags\n\n1      17.4kB  134MB   134MB                Microsoft reserved partition msftr                                                                             `                    es\n\n2      134MB   8796GB  8796GB  ntfs         Basic data partition\n\n\nA: You need to add the -t FILESYSTEMTYPE argument to the command, replacing FILESYSTEMTYPE with your filesystem type. This specifies the filesystem type of the filesystem to be mounted. In your case, this would be /dev/sdb2. Some common, valid filesystem types are:\n\n\n*\n\n*auto - this is a special one. It will try to guess the fs type when you use this.\n\n*ext4 - this is probably the most common Linux fs type of the last few years\n\n*ext3 - this is the most common Linux fs type from a couple years back\n\n*ntfs - this is the most common Windows fs type or larger external hard drives\n\n*vfat - this is the most common fs type used for smaller external hard drives\n\n*exfat - is also a file system option commonly found on USB flash drives and other external drives\n\n\nA: I was getting a similar error:\n# mount /dev/sdb1 /mydisk/ -t auto\nmount: you must specify the filesystem type\n\nI tried finding out the issue and the issue was, I had partitioned it but no filesystem was assigned.\n# mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb1 2>/dev/null\n...\nSuperblock backups stored on blocks: \n...\nWriting inode tables: done                            \nCreating journal (32768 blocks): done\nWriting superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done\n\nThis filesystem will be automatically checked every 39 mounts or\n180 days, whichever comes first.

What to do?\n\nA: This should give you all the information you need\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\nIf you download from a torrent there should be no need to check that the download is good prior to burning.\nTorrent download options can be found on the same page as the other Ubuntu download options - http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/\n\nA: Nothing to worry, just download the latest Ubuntu release from here and write it in a CD/DVD and boot with CD/DVD drive afterwards.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\n\nA: There is nothing different for ubuntu when it comes to installing an operating system.You follow the exact same procedure as you would do with any other OS,like Windows or Mac.\nOf course you can use the wubi installer if you are unfamiliar with the installing procedures,but ubuntu will not be installed in another partition of your hard drive, just \"nested\" inside your already running windows/mac partition.\nThe ubuntu help page provides lots of useful information on how to install ubuntu:\nFirst of all,what you have to do is download the .iso file containing ubuntu from the related ubuntu page.Then you can burn the .iso file into a USB drive and boot from there, which you can achieve using the cross-platform tool named Unetbootin.\nYou may also burn the .iso in a CD, following this  Microsoft Windows tutorial.\nLast but not least, you can buy a CD with Ubuntu 12.04 pre-installed from the Official Canonical Store.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I keep repeating the error - somehow when creating a boot USB disk I am getting the wrong version and no dialogue comes up for options to select 'replace windows'. I cannot seem to distinguish the correct series of links on the website to the correct download... At least I think that is my error, or is it further along in the process where I could be going wrong?\nI installed using WUBI but did not realise until the restart that it was nested. Perhaps it is appropriate to note for newbs exctly what WUBI is before we download. I will now dig deep into the links to find an ISO that is not partition installed within windows.\nPart of my reason for putting Ubuntu on one of my machines instead of windows is that it is now 10 years old, and post service pack 3, it is just dysfunctional. I wanted a clean install.\nAnyhows Ububtu runs far slicker on the machine than windows did, I like the UI, reminds me a bit of apple 20 years ago. That is a complement btw.\n\nA: There is also Pendrive Linux.  Download the Ubuntu ISO image from the download section of Ubuntu.com and then use this guide to get the ISO image on the USB flashdrive: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/.\n", "Q: How to access Dungeon Crawl \"morgue\" (files for past games)? I recently got a small game from Software Center called Dungeon Crawl and I can't figure out how to view my past games. It says the morgue file (of game'overs) is in the /home/owner/.crawl/morgue/ directory, but I can't find it at all. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04. How can I find this directory?\n\nA: In those instructions, owner (or <owner>) is intended to be replaced by your username. When you first open the file browser, you'll be in your home folder (/home/owner). So you just have to navigate into the .crawl folder.\nFiles and folders that start with a . are hidden by default. To show them in Nautilus (the file browser), press Ctrl+H or do View > Show Hidden Files. Then you can navigate into the .crawl folder inside your home directory, where (assuming the documentation you read is correct) there should be a morgue folder that contains your past games.\n", "Q: 2.1 Bass Configurations for Ubuntu 12.04? I bought logitech S220 2.1.\nThe system includes a subwoofer. It works on Windows OS but i can't get the same quality on Linux 12.04.\nAs i see, there are 5 options (2, 4.1, 4, 5.1, 5) but i think it requires 2.1. \n\nA: Use 2 (or 2.0)\nYour S-220 system (see datasheet, page 2) has a standard stereo two-channel/2.0 3.5 mm input, and bass adjustments are done via a knob at the back of the subwoofer, NOT from software.\nThis is unlike higher-end 5.1 systems which have a separate audio input for the subwoofer.\n", "Q: How to remove docky anchor icon? I can find answers all around the Internet for doing it with gconf-editor in older versions of Ubuntu, but I can't find the answer for doing it with dconf-editor in latest release.\nHelp?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 you still can and have to use gconf-editor.\n\nWhen installed, run it and navigate to apps > docky-2 > Docky > Items > DockyItem. There uncheck \"ShowDockyItem\". Restart Docky.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I use the gconf editor?\n", "Q: Add PPA with Xubuntu packages to Ubuntu 12.04 If I'm using the normal Ubuntu (not Xubuntu) 12.04 can I add without getting trouble a Xubuntu ppa like https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-dev/+archive/xfce-4.10 ?\n\nA: Yes, you shouldn't have any problems using that PPA and installing packages from it.\nPlease note that the PPA contains XFCE 4.10, which isn't supported on Ubuntu 12.04, so you will essentially be beta-testing software with the bugs, etc. which accompany it. Put simply: the PPA will work, but the packages may not! :)\n\nA: Unless you happen to have something available amongst that ppa's packages installed I doubt it would give you issues.\nWhy you would want to use that PPA is perhaps another question. Even if you then installed Xubuntu - XFCE4.10 is not officially supported. \n", "Q: Where can I download Ubuntu One for Android as an APK? The Android on my phone is modded, does not have Google Marketplace and I don't want to install it.\nWhere can I download an APK to install Ubuntu One on Android?\n\nA: In general, the latest (or reasonably recent) APKs may be directly downloaded from Launchpad at:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntuone-android-files/\n\nHere's the official APK straight from Launchpad, v. 1.1.4 released May 15, 2012:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntuone-android-files/trunk/1.1.4/+download/u1f-1.1.4-google.apk\n", "Q: Failed install 12.04 on Intel Hardware Raid with Large Partition (> 2TB) I have Intel Hardware Raid on the motherboard.\nI have 10 2 TB HDD that I've configured as RAID 1+0 to be one big 8 TB HDD.\nNow I'm trying to install ubuntu 12.04 on it.\nAfter installing with default desktop installation disk I get a blank screen with a cursor flashing.\nIf I try the alternate guided partitioning option I get error: out of disk. and the grub> prompt.\nIf I boot with the rescue disk or such like I can drop into a shell and view the disk.

(not wubi, not live CD) I had problems while installing ubuntu 12.04 on a samsung laptop, the problem is the AHCI sysmtem, after a lot of searching, I found that this is almost impossible to \"fix\" and the only way i found is too much work.\nI want to install Ubuntu in the 110GB free partition of my hard drive, along with windows.\nI have a 150GB Windows partition, a 200GB documents partition, and I want to use 110 GB for Ubuntu.\nThe problem is that with the liveCD the installer and gparted shows that my entire hard drive is unallocated (the problem of AHCI).\nThe only way to fix this is to do a lot of work, with a lot of risk, so the question is whether I can install Ubuntu without using either the LiveCD or Wubi.\n\nA: Use the Ubuntu Windows installer (with these official installation instructions).\n\nA: I may have misread your question, but you may want to consider using an alternate installer(text based, using keyboard for option selection), available here for i386 and here for AMD64, or even the netboot CD, available here for AMD64 and here for i386.\n\nA: As much as I know you can install on a free space but not with wubi, you have a usb installer or a CD/DVD installer of Ubuntu to install and during the selection of partitions in the install just select the free space option.\n", "Q: Can't print (No Drivers found) Translation\nHello, I have had serious printing problems. Did not think that most printers don't work in Ubuntu. I changed operating system with the will to learn more about Linux seen as I have always worked with Microsoft, whom I am really sick off with so much exclusivity with anything, including manufacturers and dealers.\nThere are several printers in this company like the Kyocera 1016, 1820, TM-U series and HP scanners. With the scanners I already made them work with xsane but still having problems with Kyocera and TMU. I have installed the generic TMU drivers, even in RAW and it has been impossible to print out the receipt. I tried giving the LP port permissions but it won't allow me. I have looked for the drivers in Internet with no luck.\nWhat can I do because, either there are no drivers for this type of printers or because they are very rare to find. I think that Ubuntu is a great OS, although it would be even greater and I would be very grateful if this printers worked. I started this project in this company because my boss has no Microsoft Licenses, not even for the Office suite and Linux is the best choice since it is free.\nThanks, Pablo\nOriginal\nHola, he tenido serio problemas con las impresoras. No pense que en Ubuntu la mayoria de las impresoras no funcionaran. He cambiado a este sistema con animo de aprender mas de Linux ya que siempre he trabajado con Microsoft, el cual me tiene hasta el tope con tanta exclusividad para todo, incluso hasta con los proveedores y fabricantes.\nHay varios tipos de impresoras en esta empresa como la Kyocera 1016, 1820, TM-U...series y scanners HP.  Ya con el scanner logre que trabajara con xsane super bien, pero la Kyocera y las TMU no. He instalado las TMU como genericas, tambien en RAW y ha sido imposible que salga la factura. Trato de darle permiso al puerto LP y tampoco deja, he buscado controladores para Linux en internet pero definitivamente me ha sido imposible.\nQue puedo hacer porque no existen drivers para este tipo de impresoras o bien porque casi no se consiguen. Me parece que Ubuntu es un buen SO, aunque si es posible lograr imprimir o hacer funcionar correctamente a estas impresoras les estaria agradecido. Inicie este proyecto en esta empresa porque el jefe no tiene licencias de Microsoft, ni de office para nada y Linux es la mejor opcion ya que es libre.\nGracias, Pablo\n\nA: The only useful information I found was dated back to 2007 talking about problems with the Kyocera. Since then there were several fixes which you can find in the following links:\nDriver - http://sourceforge.net/projects/kyo-fs1016mfp/ \nInformation - http://www.openprinting.org/printer/Kyocera/Kyocera-FS-1016MFP (Actually the only 1016 model I found)\nInformation - http://www.openprinting.org/printer/Kyocera/Kyocera-KM-1820\nPrinting Database - http://www.openprinting.org/printers (So you can check the rest of them. I am pretty sure all of them work except the TMU which might actually be a typo and it might be TM.)\n\nLa unica informacion util que encontre fue de 2007 donde hablaban de un problema con la Kyocera. Desde entonces se han reparado varios problemas. Aqui te dejo los siguientes links que te ayudaran:\nControladora - http://sourceforge.net/projects/kyo-fs1016mfp/ \nInformacion - http://www.openprinting.org/printer/Kyocera/Kyocera-FS-1016MFP (La unica 1016 que encontre)\nInformacion - http://www.openprinting.org/printer/Kyocera/Kyocera-KM-1820\nBase de Datos de Impresoras - http://www.openprinting.org/printers (Asi puedes chequear tu mismo las demas que tengas en la empresa.

Si en realidad es TM entonces tambien apareceran en la lista.)\n\nA: Problem can be solved by having one Windows printer server on which printers can be installed , and it will work on Linux with NoLinDrivers printer server, you can read full tutorial about how to print from linux WITHOUT needing any linux printer drivers or PPDs here: http://linuxibos.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-print-from-linux-without-needing.html\n", "Q: NVIDIA Driver troubles on GeForce2 Go at 1600x1200 My system (Dell Inspiron 8100) uses Nvidia NV11 GeForce2 Go at 1600x1200.  All is working, save I cannot get any hardware acceleration, making video playback and animation unbearably slow and jerky.  In \"Additional Drivers\" I show TWO instances of NVIDIA binary Xorg driver, kernel module and VDPAU binary.  Neither is \"activated\" and when I try to activate I get \"SystemError: E:Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages\"\nI have no clue what package might have been \"held\" as as far as I know I never refused to allow any upgrades.  I would like to simply remove BOTH instances of the binary, but nothing I have tried works.\nDoing an lshw scan for nvidia hardware reports the driver=nouveau.\nI tried to do the update to the nvidia-current, and remove nouveau, but that failed, leaving me running in 800x600 degraded mode.  The Nvidia-Settings app reported no Nvidia driver installed after the update.  I tried several attempts to force it, by editing xorg.confg and other hacks with no luck.\nI think my problems stem from the broken binary drivers inhabiting the additional drivers app, and if I can get them out, the nvidia-current might install correctly.  But despite many attempts, I am just stuck.\nHelp Please?  I am unable to proceed at this point, having exhausted all my own expertise.  The system works fairly well, save the lack of acceleration.  I just need to get over that little bump and I would be one happy camper.  Any clue would be most appreciated.\nThanks,\nNathan\n\nA: The OP found a solution. Reformatted excerpt:\n\nThe business of the bogus \"Additional Drivers\" entries was a red\n  herring. Turns out the problem was color depth. This old and wimpy\n  machine simply cannot handle the default color depth that 12.04\n  assigns.\nInstalling a basic xorg.conf setting color depth to 16, down from\n  the default of 32, made a huge, huge difference.\nThere is still room for improvement, but I do not expect miracles from\n  such very old hardware. It now plays Youtube videos, in the browser\n  window just fine. Of course full-screen is too much, but that is to be\n  expected.\n\n", "Q: Invisible DVD/CDROM drive I'm running Ubuntu 11.04 on my Toshiba Satellite A75-S206 but my DVD/CDROM is not showing. As a result, I'm unable to install \"Precise Pangolin\". How can I reinstall my driver?\n\nA: Do you have the CD?  If so, how did you get it?  If you burned it, then it must be recognized.\nAssuming you have the CD, is the problem that it won't boot from the CD?  If so, this isn't a driver issue, since no operating system is even present at boot time, and a driver is part of the operating system.  The problem would be that your BIOS is not set to boot from the CD, which isn't really a Ubuntu problem.  But the solution is to press the key that brings up the BIOS before booting (often either delete or F1, but it should tell you briefly when you restart), and tell it to boot from the CD before the hard disk drive.\n", "Q: How to install NVIDIA GeForce 610M on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS root@wruslanAC-bismillah-rtai:~/Downloads/Linux-Drivers-ACER-4752G/xf86-video-intel-2.14.0# uname -a\nLinux wruslanAC-bismillah-rtai 2.6.32-122-rtai #rtai SMP Tue Jul 27 12:44:07 CDT 2010 i686 GNU/Linux\nroot@wruslanAC-bismillah-rtai:~/Downloads/Linux-Drivers-ACER-4752G/xf86-video-intel-2.14.0# lspci\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Device 0104 (rev 09)\n00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sandy Bridge PCI Express Root Port (rev 09)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Device 0126 (rev 09)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation Cougar Point HECI Controller #1 (rev 04)\n...\n...\nroot@wruslanAC-bismillah-rtai:~/Downloads/Linux-Drivers-ACER-4752G/xf86-video-intel-2.14.0# ./configure\nchecking for XORG... no\nconfigure: error: Package requirements (xorg-server >= 1.6 xproto fontsproto ) were not met:\nNo package 'xorg-server' found\nNo package 'fontsproto' found\n....\n....\nroot@wruslanAC-bismillah-rtai:~/Downloads/Linux-Drivers-ACER-4752G/xf86-video-intel-2.14.0# apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel\nReading package lists...

There are two potential issues going on... One is related to hardware, the other software.\nFor the software end of things, your laptop is most likely suffering from \"Multiple WiFi Personalities\". Basically, the way I understand it, Ubuntu is not clear on which wifi drivers should be loaded based on incompatibilities with the hardware (this is just how I understand it... I could be wrong =).\nThe simple & temporary test is to blacklist \"acer-wmi\" (from terminal):\nsudo rmmod -f acer-wmi\nsudo rfkill unblock all\nrfkill list all\n\nif that stets all of your blocks to \"no\", you are in business... simply edit your /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file to blacklist that item and you are good to go.\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nWhen the editor opens, add blacklist acer-wmi as a new line at the end of the file. Save and Exit. then type in the following just to double check things:\nrfkill list all\n\nIf you still see any \"Hard blocked: yes\" entries at this point, you have one of three things going on. Either your physical wifi switch is in the off position (if you have one... my z570 has it on the front bezel), your software switch is off (Fn+F5 on my z570) or you may need to simply reset your Bios. \nFor me it took resetting my Bios to fix it. Simply restart your laptop and press F2 at boot up. Once in the Bios, press F9 to reset the Bios, followed by F10 to save and exit. Test your wifi now. If it's working, you can now head back to your bios and get things setup the way you like them again.\nIt took a TON of digging and trial and error until I finally got this working. I hope you don't have the same perils!\n\nA: Ditto on the bios reset. My Lenovo Z570 didn't see wireless even after a full wipe and install of Quantal; I had to do the F9 bios reset. It works perfectly now.\nI have also posted the solution at: http://thecowgirlcoder.com/2012/10/18/lenovo-z570-phy0-hard-blocked-solution/\n\nA: I am having similar issues on my s205.\nOn a previous install (12.04), I had Ubuntu appearing as an item in the boot list in bios. The recommended solution to that was to make sure your HDD was listed higher in boot order (as suggested by alex).\nWhen I ran updates, it would periodically cause this Ubuntu item to be pushed up the list again, and again I would move it. \nMore recently, I have installed 13.04. This was after a very painful process of trying to get anything to install, and boot on the machine. [The solution to that was to change the name and location of my efi file to be exactly /EFI/boot/bootx64.efi on the efi partition, but I should leave that to a different post.]\nAnyway, this most recent install left me with the same issue that the wifi seems to be switched off by the hardware switch, and no amount of blacklisting or switching actual hardware switches changes this. Unfortunately, there is no longer an Ubuntu item in the bios. Arrghh.\nWell. I have a working solution, but it ain't pretty. Every time I boot the machine, I press fn+f11 (=f12) to enter the custom boot screen. I then toggle the highlighted items back and forth, and then boot from HDD. I don't know how I discovered that this worked, but nothing else I have tried does. So there you go. If anyone can find an uglier workaround to a software issue, I haven't come across it. In the mean time, it seems to work.\nWell, I say that. But I recently drained the battery. And my 'method' lost its mojo. I had to reset the bios. After which, my ugly workaround is again working.\nI would love to hear if anyone has a better solution, but if you have a Lenovo Ideapad s205, model number 1038, and nothing else works. Then try this.\n\nA: move hard disk above ubuntu in boot order in BIOS (restart, hit f2)\nsource lenovo s205\n", "Q: How to remove the rounded menu items from a theme?

Now I have apache 2.2 running on port 8080. I wish to find out on which port is the tomcat 6 running on? What is the command to find that out?\nEDIT\nAlso how do I identify whether it is up and running?\n\nA: By default it runs on port 8080\nYou can scan your ports and other's ports by using \"nmap\"\nFor your own machine:\nnmap localhost\n\n\nA: Try the below:\nnetstat -ntpl | grep java\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:**8005**          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2710/java\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:**8008**            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2710/java\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:**8009**            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2710/java\n\n\nA: If you use\n$ ps -ef\n\nor\n$ top\n\nyou should be able to find the PID (Process ID) for your opengeo-suite.\nWith the PID in hand, you can use netstat and grep to find out what port it's running on. For example, I can see the PID of my tomcat is 1483. So using,\n$ sudo netstat -lnp | grep 1483\n\nI get the result:\ntcp6       0      0 :::8080                 :::*                    LISTEN      1483/java       \ntcp6       0      0 127.0.0.1:8005          :::*                    LISTEN      1483/java \n\nI don't think you asked this, but for completeness, to find the process ID when you know port number:\n$ sudo lsof -i:8080 -n\n\ngives\nCOMMAND  PID    USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\njava    1483 tomcat6   36u  IPv6   3496      0t0  TCP *:http-alt (LISTEN)\n\nNote, netstat and lsof will run without sudo, but they won't show all ports.

Is this when Ubuntu is installed, or before the installation process (or both?)\nAlso, is this Ubuntu behaviour similar for other flavours of Linux?\nIs boot accessed every time the system starts up? \nAre there any significant files which are only accessed upon installation and not during a normal startup?\n\nA: The usual approach (usual — other than the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, there is no strong rule to do so, it is just done this way in many distributions) is to have boot-related files stored in /boot.\nThis usually includes\n\n\n*\n\n*The kernel image\n\n*An additional image to use as '/' during the early stages of the boot process (optional, and usually used by prebuilt kernels which have a lot of modules, and may require a module to mount the real '/')\n\n*Bootloader files, when the bootloader requires additional files (like GNU GRUB)\n\n\nThat's usually how /boot is used, I've never seen a system where these files, by default, go somewhere else, but you could always configure your bootloader so that you can use another folder.\nThese files are required to boot the system, so they're accessed each time you boot. They're actually what you boot when you boot the computer.\n", "Q: Notebook Dell Inspiron N5110 Overheating after Installing Ubuntu 12.04 I am a Windows 7 User and decided to install Ubuntu 12.04 on my Notebook Dell Inspiron N5110 and when the Grub loads with the menu list, the fan starts speeding up.\nIf I choose Windows, the fan is noiseless; but, if I choose Ubuntu it continues speeding up and overheating. \nIf there is a solution for this. I wonder if someone could spend some time helping me out because I have JUST bought this notebook because it is in the list of Certified Hardware:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201012-6931/\nSo you linux wonderful guys help!\n\nA: Ya the overheating problem, unfortunately, Ubuntu developers haven't solved this issue, even though they say install 11.10, well my fellow Linux friend, 11.10 won't solve your issues.  I have the exact laptop you do, and it still overheats, when I use to run 11.10 or the new LTS 12.04.  Apparently the Ubuntu developers don't know how to fix this fan clock bug.  But I did the next best thing and bought a cooling pad. Don't spend more than 50 bucks though for this band-aid fix.  I only spent about 30 for a dual fan USB cooler.  Now that's in Canadian dollars though. \nI have researched for almost a year now why Ubuntu has this silly laptop overheating problem and I can't find a useful thing that actually solves this issue except for installing \"Jupiter\" for Ubuntu, this does help a bit, by choosing things like performance levels, which include \"max performance\" \"Power on Demand\" and \"Power saver\".  Well all this seems to do is slow down video graffics while trying to view video, or even such simple tasks as playing angry birds on facebook.(This happens on my girlfriends older Acer laptop)  But seeing that you have an Inspirion 5110 this shouldn't be an issue since I have the same laptop.  Mine is an i5 Intel Core.  \nI really hope you buy a cooling pad though, keeps temps down.  In my opinion it's a toss up between getting viruses, spyware, malware infecting your computer using windows while surfing the web.  I choose buying a simple cooling pad, didn't cost much, saves my laptop from overheating, and I can surf the web without constant virus attacks.  \nNow, as for installing \"Jupiter\" on your Nice Dell Laptop simply open your \"Dash\" type terminal and open it, copy and paste the following, one line at a time, then restart and you should have a lightening bolt icon on your top task bar, there you should be able to choose your CPU power consumption.\nFrom a terminal, run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pyjupiter\nsudo apt-get install jupiter-support-eee\n\nLike I said, it doesn't seem to matter about the version of Ubuntu you use(like the person above replied to you) when it comes to this issue, simply buy a cooling pad, and do the above.  I suggested sticking with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, since the LTS stands for Long Term Release, which is supported for the next 3 years.  Kind of like Microsoft does with their support.  When it comes to Ubuntu always stick with LTS, due to the fact of Long term support.  As a Dell Inspirion 5110 user I really love using this O/S, Windows actually blew my speakers on this Laptop, While using Ubuntu(GNU/Linux) I haven't had a problem, also my girlfriend uses Ubuntu 12.04 on her Acer(2years old) and has never seen the \"BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH\" since switching to Linux from Windows.\nWe all have some reason to use Microsoft, but as for free goes I choose Linux, which also doesn't force you to get rid of your Main O/S, unlike Windows.  If you wan't a virus free fully perfect system you could always buy a MAC, also remember the historic fact the Apple actually has part of the Linux line of code(Kernal) inside it.  This is also why you don't need a virus scanner in Mac as well as Linux, Unlike Windows, which is a decent O/S but the Costly Virus Scanner Subscriptions and constant maintainance from infected root files, just doesn't add up over the years.  If you have the means I suggest buying a Mac, but if you can't afford it, stick with a second O/S and run LINUX.  It's up to you.  But don't go on hating something you are new too, take your time then make your opinions public.\nHope this helped.\n\nA: You could take a look at this article (it's from my blog)\nKeenformatics -  How to solve Dell laptops fan issues in Ubuntu\nand at this discussion here on askubuntu:\nDell Inspiron 5521 i7-3317U Fan CPU too Noisy\nHere are the main steps as written on that site.\nHow To solve Dell laptops fan issues in Ubuntu\n\n*\n\n*First of all, let's download and install i8kutils. Open your terminal and write:\n\nsudo apt-get install i8kutils\n\n\n*Now you've got to add i8k to your modules. Open the modules file:\n\nsudo gedit /etc/modules\nand add the string \"i8k\" (without quotes) to the file. Save and exit.\n\n\n*Create an i8k.conf file\nsudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/i8k.conf\nand fill it with this code:\noptions i8k force=1\nNote: Some older guides will tell you to create a /modprobe.d/options file. The \"options\" file isn't used anymore on Ubuntu. What does matter is that you create a file with a .conf extension (the filename isn't important, but I decided to name it i8k.conf for clarity). So beware of older i8kmon configuration guides.\n\n\n*Now restart your computer, or run this code to make i8k run:\n\nsudo modprobe i8k force=1\n\n\n*We will now create a i8kmon.conf file which will tell the i8kmon utility how to behave.\n\nsudo gedit /etc/i8kmon.conf\nPaste the following code in it:\n    # Run as daemon, override with --daemon option\n    set config(daemon)      0\n     \n    # Automatic fan control, override with --auto option\n    set config(auto)        1\n     \n    # Report status on stdout, override with --verbose option\n    set config(verbose) 1\n     \n    # Status check timeout (seconds), override with --timeout option\n    set config(timeout) 20\n     \n    # Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n    set config(0)   {{-1 0}  -1  40  -1  40}\n    set config(1)   {{-1 1}  30  60  30  60}\n    set config(2)   {{-1 2}  53  128  53  128}\n     \n    # For computer with 2 fans, use a variant of this instead:\n    # Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}\n    # set config(0) {{-1 0}  -1  52  -1  65}\n    # set config(1) {{-1 1}  41  66  55  75}\n    # set config(2) {{-1 1}  55  80  65  85}\n    # set config(3) {{-1 2}  70 128  75 128}\n     \n    # end of file\n\nThis has been edited to match my Dell Inspiron 15r 5521 fan configuration (and I hope I did it well). If you want more informations take a look at the documentation on Ubuntu Manuals: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man1/i8kmon.1.html\n\n\n*Now you should be able to run i8kmon from your terminal and see if (and how) it's working. Simply run:\n\ni8kmon\nFinished!\n\nA: Seems to me you've propably set in your ways with windows and don't want to bother exploring linux. Your post is not a question but a rant against ubuntu/linux.\nAnyway, your laptop is overheating because it has 2 graphics cards, 1 inside the processor and a seperate dedicated nvidia card. It is based on an nvidia technology named \"optimus\". The cpu graphics card is responsible for the majority of rendering and the nvidia kicks in whenever and demand for higher graphics occur. In that case the nvidia is processing the image on a seperate buffer and when it's done, it renders it through the cpu card.\nFor that whole thing to work, special nvidia optimus drivers are required, and nvidia didn't provide linux with such. You will notice the same over heating behavior in windows also if you remove the drivers since the nvidia card cannot tell when it is not needed and keeps running full-power all the time.\nFortunately a group of linux developers managed to deal with the mess nvidia created with \"optimus\" , by making the project \"bumblebee\" . With that installed your linux kernel will be able to identify the nvidia card and shut it down unless you invoke it for a specific application your self. Enough with theory...now to the practical part:\n1)Remove any proprietary nvidia drivers you have installed from your ubuntu. If it's a fresh ubuntu 12.04 installation you are good to go.\n2) Fire up the terminal and give the commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\n\npress enter when asked.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\n\nAfter te process is done reboot you laptop and enjoy your cool & quiet laptop.\nAlso, to use a heavy application with the nvidia card simply , open a terminal or use the alt+F2 command exec , and type the word \"optitun\" before the name of the application you waknt to start. For example:\noptirun firefox\n\nIf you want to compare the performance bettween the 2 cards you can do the following:\nOpen terminal and type\nglxspheres\n\nnow monitor the framerate of the animation. then close it and type in the terminal\noptirun glxspheres\n\nThe difference should be obvious ;-)\n\nA: Instead of starting out with the latest distro....how about going to Ubuntu 11.10.  Of course there are going to be kinks to be worked out considering how short of a time period that 12.04 has been released for upgrade.\nFrom my own personal experience I have had no issues running Ubuntu 11.10 on machines built to handle XP (8 year old machines).

How do I properly configure my network with my static DNS addresses?\n\nA: Easiest method of configuring your DNS servers is to use NetworkManager\nUnder IPv4, fill in your dns server(s)\n\n\nA: I was able to work around this on a headless ubuntu server install by adding \nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\n...after the relevant interface stuff in /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.28\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8\ndns-nameservers 8.8.4.4\n\nHope this helps later users!\n\nA: \nNote: carefull using without direct access on the machine, this will cut the connection...\n\nI use \nsudo ifdown eth0\n\nthen\nsudo ifup eth0\n\nIt will reset and release everything...\nIf it faces with errors related to configuration, you can use:\nsudo ifdown eth0 --force\n\n\nA: This worked for me \nsudo vi /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base\n\nand add: \nnameserver <add your router ip>\n\nRun:\nsudo resolvconf -u\n\nI use core install of ubuntu server.\n\nA: As the questioner gives the contents of his /etc/network/interfaces I infer that he is using ifup to configure interfaces. But since he may actually be using NetworkManager, I will discuss that as well.\nIf you are using ifup then DNS settings go in /etc/network/interfaces.  For each interface you add dns-* options appropriate for the nameserver(s) available over that interface.  E.g., if a nameserver at address 1.2.3.4 is available over interface eth0, then add dns-nameservers 1.2.3.4 to the iface eth0 stanza.\nIf you are using NetworkManager then settings are entered in the Connection Editor (network indicator | Edit Connections...) in the IPv4 Settings tab.\nDoing /etc/init.d/networking restart to reconfigure interfaces is deprecated. If you are using ifup then first ifdown each active network interface, then ifup each interface. If you are using NetworkManager then, first, disable networking using the indicator (top of the desktop); then open a terminal and run\nsudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart\n\nand then enable networking using the indicator.\nOr you can just reboot.\nRegarding the fact that /etc/init.d/networking restart resulted in\nRTNETLINK answers: File exists\nFailed to bring up eth0  \n\nThis means that ifupdown thinks that eth0 is already up. Use ifdown --force eth0 to cause ifupdown to stop believing that it has already configured the interface.\nRegarding the \"deprecated\" message, this message is no longer printed in Ubuntu 12.10 but you should still note that initscripts are \"on their way out\". To restart a service foo, use service foo restart or restart foo. Note also that if you want to reconfigure your interfaces it is better to ifdown them one by one than to rely on restarting \"networking\".\n\nA: If none of the above work, keep it mind that Ubuntu appends a tail file to the resolv.conf file that it generates.\nTry this:\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d\nsudo nano /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail\n\nWhich will open a blank resolv.conf.d file in the nano text editor.  You will need to place your DNS server address on the first line of this file and remember to end the line with a carriage return (hit enter) as seen below:\n\nnameserver 10.20.1.2\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can also use Google's public DNS: 8.8.8.8 and/or 8.8.4.4.\n\nEditing the tail file instead of the actual resolv.conf file will prevent your change from being lost upon a system reboot.\nYou will need to run sudo resolvconf -u to activate the change.  You should be able to ping google.com after this.  Good luck!\nIf the command above does not find resolvconf, you can download it using:\nsudo apt install resolvconf\n\n\nA: You are missing a subnet specification in the interfaces file.  \nAdd netmask 255.255.255.0 to /etc/network/interfaces below the network line.\n\nA: I had this problem.

For instance, I found that channel 3 and 4 worked great for me.\nHope that works.\n\nA: By default, Ubuntu provides a generic Broadcom driver, packaged as broadcom-sta-common. This driver lacks a very important part: firmware for the device. Most Broadcom wireless chips require firmware to be loaded onto them every time they start. This firmware is freely available in the Ubuntu repositories. For legal reasons, Ubuntu cannot install it by default. Users must do it themselves. To do that, find \"firmware-b43-installer\" in Ubuntu Software Center.\nNote that firmware-b43-installer will conflict with broadcom-sta-common. Make sure you do not have both installed.\nAlso, on some machines, firmware-b43legacy-installer or firmware-b43-lpphy-installer might have to be used. To be sure, check this list of supported devices. While you're at it, knowing the exact id of your chip might help: type lspci -nn | grep Network into the terminal. You should get a line like this:\n0001:01:01.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g] 802.11g Wireless LAN Controller [14e4:4318] (rev 02)\nThe exact id of your chip is at the end.

I installed Cinnamon on my Ubuntu 12.04, and it works well, but sometimes it just freezes for no reason. I can move my mouse but can't click on anything. \nSo I want to restart Cinnamon from tty, like I used to do with gnome shell. How do I do that? \nI tried killall cinnamon and nothing happened. \nThen I tried export DISPLAY=:0.0 , cinnamon --replace and still nothing. \nI guess the command cinnamon is not valid.\nI don't want to restart the whole X server because then all of my windows will get closed. I just want to restart the window manager cause I believe it is causing the problem.\n\nA: The cinnamon --replace process can be sent the HUP signal which will trigger it to restart, thus preserving your open window and running applications.\n$ pkill -HUP -f \"cinnamon --replace\"\n\nThis will take care to send the HUP signal to a process that matches the pattern, \"cinnamon --replace\". The signal HUP (SIGHUP) tells the process to \"Hang Up\".\n\nA: When you kill cinnamon, check if it hasn't stopped writing killall cinna and pressing Tab. If the rest of the word appears, make it die with killall -9 cinnamon, and then restart it, using what you tried but without --replace:\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0; cinnamon\n\n\nA: This happens to me a lot, too, and this thread is one of the top results when googling for \"restart cinnamon\". Unfortunately, the instructions don't work for me (only because the display number is wrong!). For future visitors, here's what I do that always helps me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Cinnamon freezes\n\n*Switch tty. I usually go to tty6, Ctrl+Alt+F6\n\n*If you need to login first, do so. \n\n*Type w (yes, just the letter) and press enter. This commands does a lot of different things, but you need it to figure out the number of the display you are using. The display number is in the column FROM. Mine is :0 (yes, including the colon).\n\n*Assuming that cinnamon is already dead (which you would notice by the windows lacking titles and that you can't move different windows around, and perhaps even not being able to use the keyboard), you type export DISPLAY=:0; cinnamon &, and don't forget the colon. I add the ampersand (&) only not to keep that tty busy.\n\n\nThis always works for me, and I don't lose open windows.\nAlso, I keep these instructions in a file called restartcinnamon, which is just a text file. I keep the file in my Dropbox folder, so no matter what machine I am on I can just type cat ~/Dropbox/restartcinnamon if I need to be reminded of how to do it.\n\nA: Cinnamon has a direct keyboard-shortcut to restart the desktop without restarting any of the running applications:\nctrl+alt+esc\nWhich will probably still work in some cases when the alt+f2 Method does not work anymory\n\nA: The following combination of the above comments worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl-Alt F1   to switch to terminal 1.   Log in if necessary\n\n\n*w  (yes, single letter \"w\" is a command) to see your display # in the FROM column).  For me it was :0  (includes the colon).  Also,  the TTY column will have the terminal # of your cinnamon session (for me it was tty8).\n\n\n*cinnamon --replace --clutter-display=:0 2> /dev/null &\nNotes on this last command:\n\n*\n\n*:0 was my display #.\n\n*& returns control of the terminal\n\n*the --clutter-display, if not entered, uses the DISPLAY, variable, which is why some of the prior suggestions did EXPORT first.   But you can just pass the argument directly to cinnamon.  See cinnamon --help for more.\n\n*2> /dev/null redirects stderr to nowhere so my terminal does not get cluttered with messages.\n\n\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F8 to return to my window cinnamon environment (F8 for me since my terminal was tty8 per the w command above. For you it may not be F8.)\nNet result:  this restarted cinnamon in my terminal (tty8) without losing my windows.\n\nA: The easiest sulution would be:\nkillall -HUP cinnamon\n\n\nA: Hit Alt+F2, type r and hit enter.\n\nA: You can restart Cinnamon by:\n\n\n*\n\n*pressing Alt+F2, type r, and press Enter,\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+Backspace (restart Xorg),\n\n*in TTY use command: sudo service mdm restart\n\nA: try this \n\n\n*\n\n*pressing Ctrl + Alt + F2\n\n*export DISPLAY=:0.0; cinnamon --replace\n\nA: You can try the w -ous command and check if there is number for DISPLAY.

What I highly recommend for your case is just to burn the ISO image on a Pen Drive or CDROM/DVDROM and install it via the Standard Ubuntu installer (Booting from the CD/DVD/USB Drive). That way you can even choose to remove Windows if you want and have it only with Ubuntu.\nYou can also even repartition the hard drive to have a space for Ubuntu and a space for Windows.\nBasically with the Ubuntu installer you have a little more freedom compared to WUBI. And to top it off, it is very easy to use.\n\nA: If you like Ubuntu you can burn the ubuntu .iso to a CD or put it on a flash driver and install it.\nBurn iso\nUSB\nWhen you install it, simply use the entire Hard drive (Erase disk and install Ubuntu).

Do note that the keyboard stops randomly, and i never had problems during the install or boot or such.\nI wrote this w/ my on-screen keyboard. it has no function keys however, so the solution presented here wouldn't be applicable.\nI also naturally wouldn't want to have to relog every time this happens.\nI can access my console fine w/ my on-screen keybd, so terminal commands i can do.\nMy laptop is a Dell Inspiron 7110 \n\nA: When it happens to me I usually click on the touchpad (not the mouse) and it resumes working.\nBad bug, btw, Ubuntu's getting worse and worse.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my keyboard.

When I try to use a live CD, My Dell XPS 14z will not read the disk and skips to booting windows, I've had previous questions discussing this but everything I have tried never works.\nI'm almost absolutely sure that I am not burning the CD wrong, because windows recognizes it as a Ubuntu install disc. \nBut when I boot from CD drive it never reads the CD!\nI used to have a wubi installation, but I uninstalled it, when I try to reinstall it I get an error. I forgot what it is but i will post it later in a comment.\nI've tried to use the boot CD helper (whatever it's called)\nBut I get an error there too, again I'll post it in the comments.\nAlso, I have had absolutely no problem in the past installing Ubuntu on other computers.\nThe first thing I did when I tried to install ubuntu is to make sure the priority was set to boot from cd drive. so that isn't the problem.\nCould windows be interfering with the installation of Ubuntu?\nShould I do a clean install of windows then try Ubuntu?\n\nA: You probably have to change the boot order. For most Computers the boot order is set in the BIOS. You will have to hit and hold a special key after you turned your computer on. Most likely its Shift or Tab or one of the F-keys. Your machine will give you a hint on the boot screen.\nSet the boot order to:\n\n\n*\n\n*DVD/CD-Rom\n\n*HDD\n\n*...\n\n\nThen your computer will try to boot from your CD/DVD-Drive first, then from your Harddisk.\n\nA: There is no way windows can interfere with the boot process, assuming you are doing a full bootup, not simply waking up from hibernate or suspend.  At that time, windows is not running; in fact, no operating system is running.  Only your computer firmware can have any effect.\nThe computer's firmware is controlled by the BIOS setup, which has a setting for the order of devices to look at to boot.  If you're really not about the CD, you could set the BIOS to boot only from the CD, and no other devices.  Then, if the CD is not bootable, you will get an error when it tried to read it.  But in any case, you should be able to tell if it tries to access the CD before booting the HD.  If not, then it is not set correctly.\n\nA: Short answer is no. You went to your bios and made sure boot from CD is before boot from hard disk? Also, if you have a thumb drive highly recommended to install from a thumb drive. You can make the bootable thumb drive easily using unetbootin (in Windows or Linux)\n\nA: Yup.  Double-check your boot order or use the F12 (or other hotkey) boot menu to change the order to manually boot from CD.  This has nothing to do with Windows or other hard disk stuff.\nIf you still want Wubi, run wubi.exe in the same directory as the .iso file and voila! from within Windows.  Don't use the CD.  If you want a dual-boot (something else entirely; wubi uses a virtual hard drive), then CD is the way to go.  I would recommend true dual-boot, but it sounds like Wubi is more your speed right now.\n(The somewhat-cloudy-eyed  leading the blind!)\n", "Q: ASUS 1215n 12.04 overheating This is the 3rd time i install Ubuntu. And this time it's 12.04. I've been going back to Windows, but keep on coming back!\nBut I just got this one problem, my ASUS EeePC 1215n keeps on overheating when i run Ubuntu!\nI've seen that this is a common problem and therefore thought it might be a piece of cake to fix it, but the more i read about it, the more confused I get!\nI'm a fairly novice linux user and would really appreciate if someone could help me out with a step by step instructions to how to fix this! (even include what I'm supposed to write in terminal).\nWhat I've understood from most posts I've read is that the nvidia Ion2 driver needs to be disabled? I guess it's because it just goes haywire even though it's not being used...right? will this solve my overheating problems?\nI'm sorry for this being a repost, but like I said, this is my 3rd time around and all my searching really hasn't got me any further down the road!\n\nA: If your BIOS has an option to use the Integrated graphics chip, configure it to do so in order to disable the nvidia card -> lower temperature.\nIf you intend to use the discrete nvidia card sometimes, have a look at Bumblebee.

IF so disable it, my laptop also an ASUS had that and  for some reason that i can't figure out , ubuntu couldn't control the cpu speed so it was always running 100%. Also i had a lot of dust in the heatsink so i'd suggest you check your vents for dust (blow in them(while laptop is off obviously) and see if a puff of dust comes out). Install bumblebee following the advice above. This is what should hopefully solve your problem since i haven't heard of a specific problem in ubuntu that would cause an overheat or any other kind of hardware damage. (This is not guaranteed to work since it's not a fix or a patch it's just steps to fix overheating in general)\n\nA: You can also run powertop to investigate where energy is used most. You can also use optimize option to see it produces less heath. But for permanent setting there is some work to do. Please search on google by powertop. \nsudo apt-get install powertop\n\nAlso install tlp as follows \nsudo apt-get install tlp\n\nor install the package by hand: https://launchpad.net/~linrunner/+archive/tlp\nthen\nsudo tlp start\n\nI am not sure if it is possible with Nvidia. I use ATI and it produces less, a lot less heath when memory frequency is underclocked. for example ATI5970 supposes to use memory clock 1100 Mhz, it can run stably for day with lower memory clock, even with 300 Mhz. So try underclock the memory frequency. \n", "Q: unable to unpack libgdal I am trying to install opengeo-suite and it seems due to some reason I am unable to install due to the libgdal unable to be unpacked.\nThis is the error I get everytime i execute apt-get install opengeo-suite\nUnpacking libgdal (from .../libgdal_1.8.1-1_amd64.deb) ...\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/libgdal_1.8.1-1_amd64.deb (--unpack):\n trying to overwrite '/usr/bin/gdal-config', which is also in package libgdal-dev 1.9.0-1~exp5p1\ndpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe)\n\n......\nUnpacking opengeo-suite (from .../opengeo-suite_2.5_amd64.deb) ...\n    Processing triggers for man-db ...\n    Errors were encountered while processing:\n     /var/cache/apt/archives/libgdal_1.8.1-1_amd64.deb\n    E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nHow do I solve this error?\n\nA: dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/libgdal_1.8.1-1_amd64.deb\napt-get -f install\n\n", "Q: Computer shut off mid-update and now i can't update my computer Every time I try to update I get the following error, can someone help me?\n\n\nA: If there's no other package manager running (look for muon, apper, synaptic, etc.) then you may simply remove the lock file and retry:\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nSince you say you just rebooted, there shouldn't be a package manager running.\nJust be careful, if there is a package manager running, this brute-force approach may cause serious issues.\n", "Q: Fan speed high since upgrade to 12.04 Since I have updated to 12.04 LTS my desktop pc's fan runs permanently with high speed and is annoyingly noisy.

I downloaded a program that is supposed to auto-configure NTFS programs, and it seems to have automatically put in those UUIDs for me!  The problem is that I now seem to have two entries for each drive, and it's rather cluttered.  (See below)\nsorry to be another one of those annoying people posting fstabs left and right and saying, \"Help me!\"  But I'm really stumped.\nSo I was using pysdm (the GUI frontend is \"Storage Device manager\") and I realised something awful.  It works fine to set new partition entries, but it won't change existing entries, only add new ones.  That means that if I want to change the mounted name of sda6 from A to B it makes an entirely new entry!!!\nSo anyways, I went and cleaned out my fstab, with one entry for each partition and the proper options (the NTFS stuff, file permissions).  It still asks me what to do (skip, retry, panic, manual, whatever)  once during startup - apparently it's looking for another partition that's already mounted or doesn't exist.\nCould the problem be something to do with my mtab?

If certain entries mount without error, but give access problems, you might want to unmount, make edits to fstab, then run mount -a.\nUsing UUIDs makes the file easier to maintain, but don't get too distracted by all the people talking like it's an immediate requirement.  For right now, it may be simpler to use the devices if you're willing to maintain the file whenever you make changes.  Even though UUIDs make it easier to maintain, it's not an immediate requirement to fix problems, in my opinion.  One problem at a time!\nMore on UUIDs\nOnce you get everything working, here's how to switch to UUIDs, and maintain them in the future.\nThe original fstab has a comment at the top, but here are some more details and tips:  in the terminal, enter the command sudo blkid -c /dev/null.  I add this as a comment at the top of fstab so it's easy to remember.  The '-c' switch just makes it reread the information instead of using a cached copy, to make sure it's up-to-date.  Unless you have a lot of partitions, it won't make any difference in time.\nThe result of this command is a list of all partitions, by device, with label, UUID, and type of filesystem.  You can cut and paste the UUID into your fstab file, replacing the /dev/sdx notation with UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxxxxxxx /mountpoint ...  Once you get used to it, it really isn't much trouble to maintain the UUIDs.  I'd suggest leaving a comment above the line with the old notation, although remember to update it if it changes.\n\nA: that is a mess. If possible I'd recommend just starting from scratch :-/ If that's not possible....I hope you're good at backing up because there is a fair chance you'll hit snags. I've never seen such a messed up partition setup (no offense). What is /media/BOOT? Let's start with that one.\n\nA: You should really start looking and use LVM2 if you want that many partitions.  It will make your life a lot easier.  And it work with all major linux distributions but not by MS Windows or OS X.\nYou start by format disk space to a Linux LVM partition as a physical devices (pd).  These pd usually are located on disk partitions with id set to 8e.  They can then be combined into something called volume groups (vg).  These volume groups can be from different disks, but are treated like on partition on ordinary disks.  You can later add or remove pd to/from these vg.\nLastly you create your logical volumes (lv) by partition them out of a vg.  So these lv are used like partitions from a ordinary disk.  But you can easily add and remove them later without the need for partitioning your disk.  These lv you can format and mount as any ordinary partition on a ordinary disk.\nThe difference is that this is much easier to administrat and change size later.\n", "Q: apt-get fails to upgrade, install, remove etc I upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04, had no issues that I noticed.

This contains a whole load of bleeding-edge junk for all sorts of packages. Therefore at this point those packages I was using were the newer ones.\n\n*A time later, I got bored of daily updates to X and various drivers. I disabled the PPA.\n\n*Even later, I tried installing ia32-libs and found myself in dependency hell.\nWhat was happening was I had a newer version of some package that dpkg was expecting. Rather than downgrading those few packages (as it should probably suggest) it was recommending removing most of the system so that it could remain on the latest version of the X packages.\nFixing it in my case was actually bizarrely simple: I just re-added the PPA I had disabled. After that I could install whatever I liked. This might not be exactly the same for you so be careful.\n\nI bumped into this fix completely accidentally. I had forgotten that I might have newer (and now unavailable) versions of some packages. If I had thought ahead I would have remembered another answer I gave a while ago: How do I revert all packages to their official versions?\nThe script is slow but it's nothing if not thorough. Disable all PPAs, apt-get update,  apt-get dist-upgrade and then use the script to generate a list of things that deviate from the official versions. Purge/reinstall those and you should be able live a happy, dependency-hell-free life.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with broken dependencies when trying to install wine and acroread, and a complaint when trying to install ia32-libs-multiarch, just after upgrading to 12.04 from 11.04 (passing over 11.10). It seems that some ppa's I had in 11.04 installed newer versions of applications in the system. After upgrading, the remains of these apps seemed to do some mess in the dependencies.\nThe solution that seems to work (until now), was found on a german ubuntu board (http://forum.ubuntuusers.de, posts from user Lasall):\nFirst a downgrade is required and done with the following:\ncreate the 'preferences' file:\nsudo vi /etc/apt/preferences\n\nand insert the following lines:\nPackage: *       \nPin: release a=precise*\nPin-Priority: 2012\n\nPin-Priority must be greater than 1000.\nThen you may downgrade the offending applications with:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThen you may install packages that complained about dependencies, like\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch, or sudo apt-get install ia32-libs.\nFinally, you should remove the file you just created:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/preferences\n\nbecause else no new updates would be found.\nHope this helps you too!\n\nA: I was getting similar error:\n\nlibqt4-scripttools:i386 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.3 cannot be configured\n  because libqt4-scripttools:amd64 is in a different version\n\nThe following commands fixed the error:\nsudo apt-get download libqt4-scripttools:i386\nsudo dpkg -i libqt4-scripttools:i386\n\n", "Q: iptables sharing internet connection with restricted access I am trying to configure an ubuntu server to share internet access from eth0 to client systems on eth1 however I only want to allow access in/out on port 1688 and also resolve host names while blocking all other traffic in and out. I'm not sure what IPTable rules are needed to achieve this, hoping for any help.\n[outside] <--- traffic on port 1688 ---> {eth0}[Ubuntu 11.10 server]{eth1} <-----> [Client systems]\n\nA: To do this properly, you'll really want to learn iptables so that you can troubleshoot any problems that may arise. Otherwise, iptables may become a 'black box' to you because you don't understand how to use it and prove to yourself that the problem isn't with iptables.  Don't be put off though, learning the basics of iptables really isn't that hard and if you're interested, there are many different tutorials howtos and cookbooks on the wonderful things you can do with iptables under your control (Google \"upside down internet\" for a comical example).\nWhat you want to do comes down to 3 simple steps.\n1) Append/Insert a rule to the FORWARD chain to accept TCP port 1688. If you require UDP access as well, add a similar rule but for UDP.\n2) Append/Insert rules to accept TCP and UDP port 53 to the FORWARD chain.\n3) Set the default policy on the FORWARD chain to DROP.\nAfter a very basic crash course in iptables this should be fairly easy, don't be put off by the potential complexity because you won't need to know any of it for this, this is basic stuff.\n\nA: You need to set up your server as a router and firewall between these two nets.  \nSo set up the firewall FORWARD rules in the server to only allow 1688/tcp, 53/udp and 53/tcp to pass through the firewall in your router. And set up default policy for FORWARD to DROP or DENY.  Try to use a tool like ufw or shorewall to set up a firewall.  It is much easier than to use iptables directly.\nAnyway, if you use iptables directly, you have to manually change in /etc/sysctl.conf file (or add a new file in /etc/sysctl.conf.d/) so that your computer starts to route IP messages between the two networks.  Look for net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 to solve that.\nGood instructions can be found in Ubuntu wiki.\n", "Q: EFI Boot on Asus Sabertooth 990fx not working after firmware update I recently updated the firmware on my Asus Sabertooth 990fx, and now the UEFI bios won't boot my ubuntu install, which boots off of EFI. EFI boot works for the livecd, but the BIOS doesn't seem to recognize the ubuntu install anymore, which it did before.\nAny help would be welcome.\n\nA: Your update may have removed the Ubuntu boot loader from the NVRAM settings. If the CD boots in EFI mode, you should be able to type the following commands (or some variant of them) to correct the problem:\nsudo apt-get install efibootmgr\nefibootmgr -c -l \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grubx64.efi -L Ubuntu\n\nI'm not 100% positive of the path to GRUB on the EFI System Partition (ESP), so you may need to adjust that. Also, that path is specified using EFI-style backslashes rather than forward slashes, and since backslashes are escape characters in Linux shells, they must be doubled up -- hence \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grubx64.efi rather than /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi. However it's expressed, this filename is relative to the root of the ESP, which is the partition that's identified by the boot flag in GParted or by a partition type code of EF00 in gdisk.\nAnother option is to move and rename grubx64.efi to /EFI/boot/bootx64.efi on the ESP; that's a sort of default/backup boot loader filename. A variant of this option is to install some other boot manager, such as rEFIt or rEFInd, under that name. This option might be appealing if you dual-boot with Windows or some other OS; rEFIt and rEFInd can both detect any EFI boot loader stored in conventional locations on the ESP and redirect the boot process to them. rEFIt has been abandoned, though, and the version on its Web site doesn't work on UEFI PCs; rEFInd is a fork of rEFIt that provides updates and that does work on UEFI PCs.\n", "Q: How to make shortcut to terminal application? I just installed a nifty calculator tool that needs to run from a terminal: tapecalc\nIs there a way to add either a shortcut icon (or an icon in the dash application area) or a short cut key combination so I can run this without opening a terminal and then remembering what the app's name is and then entering tapecalc in the terminal window to start it?\n\nA: Create a FileName.desktop with these contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=x.y\nName=ProgramName\nComment=This is my comment\nExec=/path-to-you-app/application_name\nTerminal=true\n\n\nA: Yes, you can start the Terminal and make it run the command automatically. Create a custom application launcher that runs this as the command:\ngnome-terminal -e tapecalc\n\nWhile this is a perfectly good way to do it, pl1nk's way is even better (in part because it will run with whatever terminal application is set as default in your desktop environment). Since that was posted, I now recommend using that method instead of this, and upvoting that answer. :-)\n", "Q: Do i have the latest drivers/software on AMD Graphics I need the override section on catalyst control center, but I don't have it.

After my attempts, my desktop has now neither the old version or the new one and I am stuck.\nUnfortunately Ubuntu no longer ships free CDs and we are stuck with the downloaded version which may be missing something. After entering user name and password, there is some error reported on both laptop and desktop after which it does not respond at all. Kindly help.\n\nA: A good idea might be to download the alternate installation package, if you are sure you want to install, and not just try it out.  \nWhen you download that ISO image, there is a way to check the ISO before burning, using the md5sum.  Once you know the ISO is valid, you can check the burned CD to make sure it is also correct.\nFor the official Ubuntu instructions to install, and to troubleshoot installation problems, you can read this guide.  There is a section on troubleshooting that explains how to check the CDs, etc.\n", "Q: Virtual Machine Putty connection I've created a VM running on my PC and am trying to connect the two via Putty.  I have Putty installed on my PC, and openssh server and client installed on my VM.  When I drop my IP address into the Putty client, a window will open up, but it's completely blank.  I can highlight the blank window, but can't type anything.  After a few minutes the window will close from a connection time out.\nIs this my firewall??  \n\nA: If you are using Virtualbox, by default it will emulate the network using NAT.  This is the simplest way to provide network access to the virtual network adapter inside the virtual machine, but it has the side effect that you can't actually connect to the services on the virtual machine from the host system.\nYou would need to change the mode of network emulation in the virtual machine from NAT to \"bridged\".\nNote that this is slightly more complex from your host operating system's point of view as it has to get low level access to your host's network adapter at the packet level.  This involves installing a special driver, particularly on Windows hosts.  Essentially your network adapter on the host will need to start behaving in a way like multiple network adapters.  This can sometimes (but not in normal situations) conflict with your outer network.\nInstead of \"bridged\", you could also use \"host-only networking\" which avoids all the above potential issues but then your guest OS won't have access to the wider network (eg the Internet).\nIf you're using something other than Virtualbox, the issues will probably be the same, but the way of fixing it may not be.\n", "Q: How come Ubuntu Cloud Live wont run in a VM?

It appears nothing has been accomplished when I start up the VM again and it repeats the process.\nIs there an explanation for whats causing this issue? Any solution?\nHost PC is a 64-bit AMD dual core with 4GB of RAM.\nI'm running 12.04 Precise (32-bit) as my host OS with BIOS hardware virtualization enabled.\nThe VM (running Ubuntu Cloud Live) has 1 GB RAM and a 8GB virtual hard drive.\n\nA: If you haven't enabled I/O APIC, you should do so - else VirtualBox won't be able to run the 64-bit guest on the 32-bit host.\nFrom the manual:\n\nOn any host, you should enable the I/O APIC for virtual machines that you intend to use in 64-bit mode. This is especially true for 64-bit Windows VMs. See the section called “\"Advanced\" tab”. In addition, for 64-bit Windows guests, you should make sure that the VM uses the Intel networking device, since there is no 64-bit driver support for the AMD PCNet card; see the section called “Virtual networking hardware”.\n\n", "Q: How can I make apache run cgi files in all directories under ./www ?

The exact same scripts work higher up the directory.\nAny way to coax apache into letting us run this cgi file in these lower directories?  \n\nA: The default apache2 configuration in Ubuntu will enable the ExecCGI option only for a specific directory below your main one (cgi-bin).  You can however add this option to any directory you like including your main one.\nFind the Apache configuration for that site.  Look for the relevant <Directory> section which will either be in one of your virtual host config files, or if it's site-wide, it'll be in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default.  You can either edit it here, or put your new configuration into a separate file under /etc/apache2/conf.d/.\nYou'll need to add ExecCGI to your Options directive (or create a new Options parameter with +ExecCGI added).\nExample for editing an existing Options directive:\n<Directory /usr/home/joe/www>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nExample for creating a new Options directive for a directory that overrides the Apache-wide default one:\n<Directory /usr/home/joe/www>\n    Options +ExecCGI\n</Directory>\n\n", "Q: How do I install libqt4.7.4?

I have a Synaptics Touchpad on my Dell XPS 14z and I was wondering if there was any way I could enable some gestures besides two-finger scrolling.\nAre there any special drivers i need? \nI've read somewhere that 12.04 has had some issues with multitouch gestures but I'm not exactly sure.\nIf there is a way, could someone give me instructions on how to enable (or get) these features?\nI found some evidence that touchegg may not work with 12.04\n\nA: \nTouchegg is designed to bring multi-touch (touchpad) functionality to\n  Linux based operating systems. In layman’s term, it is an open source\n  multi-touch gesture recognizer for GNU/Linux which is backed by C++,\n  Qt and uTouch-geis library. With TouchEgg, you can define what type of\n  actions are to be initiated for a specific multi-touch gesture.\n  Numerous actions can be assigned for multi-touch gestures such as\n  maximizing or minimizing windows, resizing applications, switching to\n  desktop view, etc. It requires uTouch and evedev libraries.\nTouchegg comes with some pre-enabled gestures, however gestures can be\n  enabled by editing the config file. It allows  three-fingers pinch,\n  two, three, four and five finger tap and two to four finger swipes.\n\nHow to install?\nadd this ppa,ppa:utouch-team/daily as,\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:utouch-team/daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install touchegg\n\nWhich gestures are supported?\ncheck here\nHow to use?\nconfig file location ~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf\nThe config file can be edited in the following way:\nopen config file.\ngedit ~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf\n\nget list of actions here\n# THREE FINGERS DRAG\n[THREE_FINGERS_DRAG_UP]\naction=MAXIMIZE_RESTORE_WINDOW\nsettings=\n[THREE_FINGERS_DRAG_DOWN]\naction=MINIMIZE_WINDOW\nsettings=\n\nSimilarly, in the example below, the four finger drag gesture is configured to switch to the desktop display.\n[FOUR_FINGERS_DRAG_DOWN]\naction=SHOW_DESKTOP\nsettings=\n\nWith Touchegg, users can easily define multi-touch gestures in order to get the Mac like multi-touch experience on their Linux systems.\nyou can watch a brief demonstration video. here and here\nI found also this one \nthough I haven't tried it.\n\nA: Not as of 07 17, 2012.  Ubuntu recommends using touchegg, which is has an API incompatibility with the latest version of utouch in Ubuntu according to this ticket. Ubuntu's Unity has some multi-touch features involving 2+ fingers, but they are not configurable without modifying source code and recompiling*.

If I put another OS on the drive, how will it distinguish between which one I would like to boot upon start up? Will this force me to delete the one in return for the other? Will a boot-loader activate when the other OS is detected? Also, will this cause problems considering the fact that 2 OSs will be on a single, non-partitioned space, albeit a flash drive, but still.\nIn case you were wondering, or that it matters at all. I will be putting Chrome OS, gotten here, on with Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: \nThere is  a tool for creating what is basically a GRUB multi-OS\n  bootloader on your USB drive. All you have to do is grab an ISO file\n  of the system you're adding to your drive, then drop the whole ISO\n  file onto the drive (occasionally with special instructions). There's\n  all the usual Linux cohorts—Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, etc.—but also\n  some great rescue tools and utilities, like the GParted partition\n  disc, Ophcrack password reset, and virus scanners. You could even load\n  a Windows 7 installation DVD onto your thumb drive, if you had the\n  room.1\n\nUnfortunately, \"MultiBootISOs is a free download for Windows\"1 only.  To get it, see this site.\n1Source: \"MultiBootISOs Boots Multiple Operating Systems from a USB Drive\" on lifehacker.com\n\nA: I think this should be theoretically possible.  So I am going to try it just to verify.\nBased on answers to other questions here regarding installing OS on flash drive at all, you can just select the flash drive as part of a normal install process.\nIf you want to dual boot the flash drive, you will need more than one partition by necessity.  Something on the order of two roots, probably two home partitions.  I read elsewhere no swap, swap a bad idea on a flash drive.\nWhen you get to the window of install that asks whether to install alongside or delete, you pick something else.  You probably want to sort out your partitions before you get to this point with GParted, set up a partition of unallocated free space after your original OS partition.\n", "Q: WiFi drops after period of time for ubuntu 12.04 on HP Pavilion g seres I have a shiny new HP Pavilion g series laptop (g7).  The very first boot of the system was a gparted-live usb to split out some space for Ubuntu.  The second was a 12.04 live usb.\nMostly it is working extremely well.  The exception is WiFi connectivity.  It seems to connect at first, but then after anywhere from 30 minutes to four hours I lose connection and cannot reconnect until I reboot the router.  Sometimes an RFKill block and unblock will fix it.  And yesterday I saw a suggestion to remove the NetworkManager.conf file.  The latter seems to have extended the time to failure to hours rather than minutes.\nWhat should my next steps be?\nThanks\n\nA: Solution found.\nvery simple actually.  I needed to load the chipset specific driver.  \nI found the specific version of my chipset with lpci \nThen I looked on the chipset manufacturers web site and found linux drivers.\nI downloaded and extracted the tarball.\nI ran \"sudo make install\" from terminal in the appropriate directory.\nReboot and all seems perfect.\nI will try to add truly specific instructions later when I am back with my laptop.\n\nA: From what I understand it could be a driver or hardware issue if connectivity isn't the problem. If you can find out what the exact chip-set is, run a Google search and see if others have had similar problems. Other reasons things could be that configuration is all messed up, Ubuntu just doesn't support the card, or somebody's hardware is failing.\nIf its just this one computer having the issue and not others, then it's probably not the router. Maybe try getting one of those cheap USB WiFi adaptors. Disable the built in WiFi and use the external one. You can at least isolate the problem to the chipset.\nBe sure to check the \"Restricted Drivers\" in the System Settings to see if there is a proprietary one to use.\n\nA: Ok, more specific Steps:\nRun lspci and look for your wifi adapter\nIn my case it turns out to be a Realtek RTL8188CE\nGoogleing that brings me to the manufacturer's page.  Then search for \"linux\" in the page's search box leads me to a big list of downloads.  Here: http://www.realtek.com.tw/search/default.aspx?keyword=linux\nAnd on that page I see my model number and click on it, bringing me here: http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=48&PFid=48&Level=5&Conn=4&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false&Downloads=true#RTL8188CE\nOh look!

Just cd to the directory of the file in the terminal and type chmod +x commands.txt, and then ./commands.txt runs commands in the file\nNo, it need not be .txt, extension doesn't matter\n\nA: You can also put one command per line in the text file (e.g. my_commands.txt), and then run them all as:\nsource my_commands.txt\n\n\nA: In my case, the file didn't even have an extension.

My machine one day started inconsistently to fail to boot. I found that Grub was (sometimes) unable to load either the kernel or the ramdisk (it said \"out of Disk\"). It got to the point where I could only boot with the Grub command line and attempt to load them manually - after serveral failed attempts, it eventually succeeded.\nIn my kernel logs, I found numerous \"ATA bus error\"s, and noticed that the disk was operating at ATA 33 instead of ATA 133. I did a full check of the disk (using the vendors bootable tool) and it came up clean (despite very large numbers of 'seek errors' - seems those are normal for my disk!).\nI wasted a heap of time looking for Grub bugs and worrying about hardware failures when eventually I noticed a suggestion to check the cables....\n\nA: In the end, it seems it was cables. \nFollowing the suggestion in a bug report, I changed the SATA cable, used a different SATA power plug from my power supply (insufficient power is a possible culprit), and made sure the SATA cable wasn't near any other power cables (possible electical interference from other, especially power, cables).\nIt works fine now.\nI've since put the original SATA cable back in, and it still works. I'll switch power cables soon, and try dangling the SATA cable near other power cables...

Then I do a\n'ifup -a'\nand then everything works.\n\nA: \nFailed to connect to wpa_supplicant - wpa_ctrl_open: Read-only file system\n\nAccording to your log you 'll need to use wpa_supplicant.\nSo add something similar to this:\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\nwpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\nContents of /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf :\nnetwork={\n        ssid=\"ADD-YOUR-SSID-HERE\"\n        proto=RSN\n        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK\n        pairwise=CCMP TKIP\n        group=CCMP TKIP\n        psk=\"ADD-YOUR-WPA-PASSWORD-HERE\"\n}\n\n\nA: You can add ifup wlan0 to your /etc/rc.local file. Add the command ifup wlan0 before the exit 0. Also add the command ifdown wlan0 before the ifup wlan0 like so:\n...\nifdown wlan0\nifup wlan0\n\nexit 0\n\nFor some reason when Ubuntu starts, it thinks that wlan0 is up.

But it is only required for WPA-EAP, EAP-TLS networks.\nHow can I get my system to network wirelessly at boot?\nThe auto stanza does bring up the interface at system startup.\n\nA: I also encounter such a problem. \nI noticed that someone said, delete the text about primary network interface, with first 2 lines remaining. \nIt works, but no network is connected. \nThen I write the text of primary network interface back into the interfaces file and reboot.\nIt's surprising to find not only no hints \"waiting for network configuration\" occur, but I could connect to the internet.\nI don't know whether it is useful for any others.\n\nA: The reason for this is that the filesystem is read-only at boot. At this point only static settings work because udev raises network hotplug signal before the filesystem is ready.\nThe solution is to change the /etc/init/network-interface.conf file in this line: \n\n\"ifup --allow auto ...\" to\n\"ifup --allow=hotplug ...\".\n\nYou will have to mark you hotplug PCMCI and USB network adapters as \"hotplug\" in /etc/network/interfaces for them to continue to work, and you should plug them in after boot, not before.\n", "Q: 3G USB Modem Not Working in 12.04 When I connect my 3G USB Modem to my laptop with 12.04, nothing shows up in Network-Manager.

Please note that while the other answers didn't solve my problem, they might be helpful to others facing problems with 3G USB Modems (specially the sakis-3g script).\nI found my solution in this thread, which I will detail in the following:\nWhen connecting my USB modem, it is detected as a USB storage. According to that thread, running sudo modprobe option could make the device be detected as a modem. If not, it is also suggested to execute the following commands:\nsudo su\necho 1c9e 6061 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/option1/new_id\n\nwhere 1c9e 6061 is the device ID obtained from the lsusb command. This worked for my device and it was detected in Network-Manager. Note that you must become root using sudo su and running the command with sudo won't work.\nTo automate things, the following steps are presented:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo su\n\n*nano /usr/bin/usbModemScript and put the following in the file:\n   #!/bin/bash\n   echo 1c9e 6061 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/option1/new_id\n\nThen save the file (Ctrl+O) and exit nano (Ctrl+X).\n\n*chmod +x /usr/bin/usbModemScript\n\n*nano /etc/udev/rules.d/option.rules and put the following in the file:\n    ATTRS{idVendor}==\"1c9e\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"6061\", RUN+=\"/usr/bin/usbModemScript\"\n    ATTRS{idVendor}==\"1c9e\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"6061\", RUN+=\"/sbin/modprobe option\"\n\nThen save the file (Ctrl+O) and exit nano (Ctrl+X).\n\n*reboot\nNOTE : You should replace the values 1c9e and 6061 with the appropriate device ID values of your own modem.\nAfter reboot, your modem should be detected when connecting it to the computer. Of course, this might not be the case (as it wasn't for me)! My device wasn't detected correctly after the first time it was connected to the computer. Instead, I had to disconnect and then reconnect it, and this time it was correctly detected as a modem in the Network-Manger.

I have a drive on the marvel controller but it's just a static data drive, so perhaps that's why I'm not seeing any freezes as you are.\nIf you have an Asus motherboard and your ssd hybrid is connected to the marvell controller then try moving it off the the intel controller instead. If it's not then try updating your bios, and if that doesn't work then I guess it's pointing at a kernel bug for you also.\n", "Q: Ubuntu does not login I have installed (via terminal) these packages (because my Gvim had a warning about libgail):\nlibgail-3-0\nlibevince3-3\nlibwebkitgtk-3.0-0\nnautilus\n\n(I wanted to re-install the first package, when removing it Ubuntu forced to remove the other 3, then I installed all them again)\nAfter reboot, I can't login (after entering the password the screen refreshes again I enter the password and it hangs)\nCan I solve the problem(s) with live CD without erasing all my data and install everything again?\n\nA: To reset everything to the way it was before you removed the applications, once you  boot to recovery mode by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 enter you username and password, and then reinstall the Ubuntu-desktop meta package.\nCode:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nThen reboot with\nCode:\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: Java Script is not working in ubuntu firefox My ASP application is running perfect in windows IE, but when i run on ubuntu firefox Javascript is not working properly..\nBelow is my java script code.....\nAnd I am calling this java script on onFocus and onBlur event.\nwhen onBlur is fired from date format 1 digit is removing in ubuntu firefox.\nplease somebody help.\n\n\nfunction DateFormat(vDateName, vDateValue, e, dateCheck, dateType)  {\n\nvDateType = dateType;\n\n// vDateName = object name\n// vDateValue = value in the field being checked\n// e = event\n// dateCheck \n//       True  = Verify that the vDateValue is a valid date\n//       False = Format values being entered into vDateValue only\n// vDateType\n//       1 = mm/dd/yyyy\n//       2 = yyyy/mm/dd\n//       3 = dd/mm/yyyy\n\n\n   //Enter a tilde sign for the first number and you can check the variable information.\n   if (vDateValue == \"~\")\n   {\n      alert(\"AppVersion = \"+navigator.appVersion+\" \\nNav. 4 Version = \"+isNav4+\" \\nNav. 5 Version = \"+isNav5+\" \\nIE Version = \"+isIE4+\" \\nYear Type = \"+vYearType+\" \\nDate Type = \"+vDateType+\" \\nSeparator = \"+strSeperator);\n      vDateName.value = \"\";\n      vDateName.focus();\n      return true;\n   }\n\n   var whichCode = (window.Event) ? e.which : e.keyCode;\n\n   // Check to see if a seperator is already present.\n   // bypass the date if a seperator is present and the length greater than 8\n   if (vDateValue.length > 8 && isNav4)\n   {\n      if ((vDateValue.indexOf(\"-\") >= 1) || (vDateValue.indexOf(\"/\") >= 1))\n         return true;\n   }\n\n   //Eliminate all the ASCII codes that are not valid\n   var alphaCheck = \" abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ/-\";\n   if (alphaCheck.indexOf(vDateValue) >= 1)  \n   {\n      if (isNav4)\n      {\n         vDateName.value = \"\";\n         vDateName.focus();\n         vDateName.select();\n         return false;\n      }\n      else\n      {\n         vDateName.value = vDateName.value.substr(0, (vDateValue.length-1));\n         return false;\n      } \n   }\n   if (whichCode == 8) //Ignore the Netscape value for backspace.

I installed Ubuntu 12.04 from DVD-ROM onto the second drive, using the installer to partition.  When I start the computer, I do not get the option to choose the operating system, and Windows shows the drive (F:) as not having any Linux files.  What is my next step?\n\nA: This may answer your question; however, there could be a variety of problems with this, but I hope I'll find the solution for you.\nFirst, whenever you boot, hold down both Shift keys as soon as your computer hits the BIOS screen. Normally the Left one is necessary, but both won't hurt. :) What this does is, if it is configured already, will display the GRUB selection menu. GRUB, or the GRand Universal Bootloader, will list both Ubuntu and Windows booting options. If this doesn't work, read on.\nThe problem may be that the partition with GRUB on is not being booted, but the Windows one is. Boot from your Ubuntu DVD/CD/USB and select \"Try Without Installing\". Now, open up terminal from the Unity dash. Run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\nThen, with the Dash, open up Grub Customizer. Now, click on Preferences on the top right corner. Now, look for default entry and select the Ubuntu partition (Not recovery). Click close, Save, and close the application. Now, reboot.

Can I have that kind of gestures to use in Unity.\nor What are the mouse gestures available for Unity?\n\nA: For your general question take a look at \"What are Unity's keyboard and mouse shortcuts?\"\n\nFor your special question I suggest Easystroke:\n\nEasystroke is a gesture-recognition application for X11. Gestures or strokes are movements that you make with you mouse (or your pen, finger etc.) while holding down a specific mouse button. Easystroke will execute certain actions if it recognizes the stroke; currently easystroke can emulate key presses, execute shell commands, hold down modifiers and emulate a scroll wheel. The program was designed with Tablet PCs in mind and can be used effectively even without access to a keyboard. Easystroke tries to provide an intuitive and efficient user interface, while at the same time being highly configurable and offering many advanced features. (source)\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*To minimize all windows except the active one I refer to the script in this answer (minimise.py).\n\n*To manage Easystroke easily you should make it visible in the panel. For that install dconf-tools , then open dconf Editor and switch to desktop → unity → panel and to \"systray-whitelist\" add , 'easystroke' at the end.\n\n*Then start Easystroke. To add a new action click the panel icon and in the Actions tab click Add Action. Use these parameters:\n\n\n*\n\n*Name: minimize except active\n\n*Type: command\n\n*Details: bash -c 'python ~/minimise.py'\n\n\nTo set a mouse gesture click Record Stroke and then while pressing mouse button 2 move the mouse the way you like for this action in future. Ready.\n(You can change the preferred mouse button in Preferences tab with a click on Gesture Button.)\n\n\n*To minimize all windows except the active one now just press mouse button 2 and do the action you chose before.\n\n*If you like it add Easystroke to Startup Applications by marking as checked \"Autostart easystroke\" in the Preferences tab.\n\nHow to configure Easystroke you can find out in its Documentation as well as in this Tips & Tricks section.\n\nA: You can try with Easystroke..\nYou can get it from Here\n", "Q: How do I change my 1080p external monitor from portrait to landscape on an Eee PC 1000H?

One thing you could try is arranging the monitors one on top of each other, this will allow you to use full resolution (hopefully).\nNote that this limitation comes from those chipsets' inability to use a 3D texture larger than 2048x2048. So the other possible workaround is to use the Unity2D session, which doesn't use 3D textures and won't suffer from this limitation.\n\nA: What did the trick for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn laptop screen off\n\n*Slide external monitor to the left of the laptop screen (in the top display that shows the two screens).\nThen the monitor got positioned in landscape mode again, also in higher resolutions.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: What is the keyboard shortcut to switch to Applications tab in gnome3?

Clearly, you are using the amd64 architecture and hence the broken dependencies is preventing you from installing any further packages. \nOne possible solution would be to remove draftsight package for the time being and then install openssh-server and then install it back again.

Then identify the new partition that has been created with your partial linux files on, format it and select that as your install location. Then continue with your installation normally.

This automatically creates new partitions for Ubuntu, at least a /(root) where Ubuntu will reside and a swap partition(used when you run the OS). That's why there are new partitions. If those partitions are still there, you can find what happened during your install by looking into the drive where Ubuntu files are copied and going to var\\log\\installer\\syslog. And for booting into Windows 7, try the repair or rescue option from the Windows 7 DVD. \n\nA: The best tool to fix boot related issues is Super Grub Disk. You can get it here.

What I'd like is to put in 600 and 1000 in my existing resize script function and have both a regular viewable image as well as a reduced size.\n\nA: According to the documentation of ImageMagick I suggest to use -geometry x600, whereas x600 means that the new image has a heigth of 600 px with the same aspect ratio as the old image.\n\nFor a single image you could run:\nconvert input.png -geometry x600 output.png\n\nIf you prefer to convert all images of a folder in one run, switch to it (i.e. cd ~/Pictures/panoramas/) and use\nmogrify -geometry x600 *.png\n\nBut be careful with that, because it overwrites the original image files.

Once it is finished all block will be overwritten by the test data. These data can not be recovered (even forensic tools may fail there).\nOnly if you had interrupted the write process before it was finished you may have a small chance to recover remnants of your data that have not been overwritten yet.\nOption -w was designed to test new harddisks where data loss is not an issue for write failures.\n", "Q: How can I access a program from server through Firefox browser?

Why Unity is named as \"Unity\"? Is there a philosophy behind Unity's name or is it just a normal naming?\n\nA: As mentioned in http://unity.ubuntu.com/ and it's http://unity.ubuntu.com/about/\n\nThe Unity project started by Mark Shuttleworth and Canonical has gone\n  on to deliver a consistent user experience for desktop and netbook\n  users alike. Putting great design at the heart of the project, Unity\n  and its technologies such as Application indicators, System\n  indicators, and Notify OSD, have strived to solve common problems in\n  the Free Software desktop while optimizing the experience for touch,\n  consistency and collaboration.\n\nThe idea behind it is to \"Unite all devices into one common interface\", be them TV, Smartphones, Computers, Netbooks and anything new that comes. This is why the Unity interface is similar in any device it is installed to.\nUnity can be extended to others Distros. For example Fedora and OpenSuse are thinking of having Unity as a Desktop option. Archlinux is working on having it added.\nSo in a way, Unity is a Interface that will unite different Devices and also have a common Interface between Distros in the future. When I say common, I mean that Unity can be found as an alternative or maybe the default desktop in other Distros.\nFor Distros that already have working implementation of Unity:\nLeeenux - http://www.leeenux-linux.com/\nArchLinux - Has Unity in the repos.\nFor Distros that are working on implementation Unity:\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_%28user_interface%29\nOpenSuse & Fedora - Had some work with it.

I have disabled the Nvidia card in BIOS (by selecting \"integrated graphics\"), so I'm running only on the integrated Intel graphics.

As a fellow sufferer, here's what I've had to do:\nThese instructions from Sagar Karandikar work on 12.04 and 12.10.\nThe trick is, that if you're running 12.10, you need to download a version of the intel display patch that is equivalent to the closest driver you can manage from here. I managed to find a driver matching versions for Raring.\nThen, set up a script to run the display commands, change the flag from VIRTUAL to VIRTUAL1, and you're set.\n\nA: If you care about having the option to switch between the nVidia and intel chips, try Brian's solution.  If you're fine just using the nVidia chip, select the 'discrete graphics' option in your BIOS.  I've read somewhere that the VGA port is not wired to the intel chip so you'll have to enable the nVidia chip to use the extra port.

All other applications (chrome, terminal, etc) seem to work fine.\nIs there some way to restore the icons?\n\nA: You can simply drag them from the dash onto the launcher. I have had this same issue with other programs (namely Gimp) where the program does not appear on the launcher or in alt-tab. It is a known bug (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bamf/+bug/995916). The only way to get back to them is to either use SUPER+W (the super key is the Windows key, if you didn't know) or keep the shortcut on your launcher. According to the bug, it should have been fixed, so try updating too.\n\nA: What worked for me was adding first LibreOffice Write to the panel by right-clicking on it. Then the open document icons also show up. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Upgrade breaks firefox I upgraded ubuntu, but the upgrade broke firefox, adobe flash plugin and corrupted the package database.

To improve visibility of what Launcher-Applications I have running (instead of relying solely on that small right-facing triangle), is it possible to make Launcher-icons default to a black&white/dark/dim state? And then when a launcher-icon is clicked (or the super+# shortcut used) that icon would gain color and backlight signifying the app is running? \nIf the Launcher icon's app is not running, it is dimmed out. If the icon's app is running, it is showing in color and backlit.\nI'd prefer an \"inhouse\" solution as opposed to having to install additional software, but I'm interested in hearing all options for if this is possible.\n\nA: Give Ubuntu Tweak a try, I find the settings included improve the Unity launcher greatly (Including the back light option).\nHere is the web page for download Ubuntu Tweak\n\nA: Unfortunately you can't.\nYou can customize just a few standard options for unity launcher, as Unity and Compiz are using GConf to store their settings, and not a .css file like gnome-shell does.\nThe configuration data is saved under ~/.gconf, but modifications should only be made through the GConf daemon.\nYou can modify the Unity settings directly using gconf-editor and browsing to     /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options.\nYou will notice that Unity responds to changes instantly, the same as CCSM.\nIf you want a command line tool to modify these settings, use gconftool-2. For example, to reduce the launcher icon size I can do:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/icon_size --type int 32\n\n\nA: Although you can't make them greyed out (unless there is a plugin I do not know about), you can make it so they only show the background (called the backlight) if they are open. This provides a similar function.\nThe easiest way to enable this is to install MyUnity, which is just a program that makes these tweaks more accessible:\nsudo apt-get install myunity\n\nThen open it up and on the launcher tab, you will see a dropdown for Backlights. Just set that to \"Active icons On\". You will instantly notice the change.\nTo do it from the gconf-editor, simply fire up the editor, navigate to /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/backlight_mode and set it to 1. 0 is the default.\nThe command to do it using gconftool-2 would be:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/backlight_mode --type int 1\n\nto set it back:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/backlight_mode --type int 0\n\n\nA: I just install the CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM).

I believe that my Chinese ISP has started detecting and bandwidth-limiting SSH connections.  I'm not using the default SSH port so I suspect that they are using deep packet filtering to detect the unencrypted handshake.\nI am aware of one solution to this which patches openSSH to encrypt the handshake.  However, I have two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*This project is three years old so if I were to just compile it as is, I would be forsaking three years of security updates for openSSH.\n\n*My server is in the US and my only way of accessing it is through SSH--so downtime or messing up isn't an option.\n\n\nAs such I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I somehow patch a current version of openSSH to use the obfuscated handshake?

If so, how would I do this? Which files would I need to add/modify in the source?\n\nThis might be possible, but given the age of the patch, it may take time to apply.  Reading the diffs can help to explain what got edited and where, but given development of software over three years, the patch may need manually applied.\n\n2  How could I avoid any downtime for the ssh server while doing this patch? Can I install two ssh servers side by side?\n\nThis downtime is negligible.  Part of the sshd server update procedure is to turn itself off and turn itself back on when you install with a Debian package.  If you patch the source in the package itself, then upload that updated package (and increase the version accordingly) to a PPA, then add that PPA to your sources, and apt-get update and apt-get upgrade, there won't be any real downtime issues.\n", "Q: Unable to detect windows hard drive while running Ubuntu 12.04 from USB I am completely new to Ubuntu.  I experimented with Ubuntu 12.04 by running it from a USB drive, in-order to recover files from my hard disc.\nHistory:\nMy laptop is an IBM R60 running windows 7.  Suddenly it gave me an error stating \"error 2100 - Hard drive initialization error\".\nI have read all the forums and most of them suggested that I  remove and replace my HDD and that did not work. And one site suggested to try using Ubuntu to recover files.\nI booted my system from USB, and once Ubuntu came up, I choose \"Try Ubuntu\".

How do I navigate to search for my files.\n2- Is it just simply not possible if the hard disc themselves are not working?  Is that  why I`m unable to find the drives.\nI know its a very novice question, but hoping someone would help me out.\nThank you,\nEapen\n\nA: It could be that the hard disk controller on the motherboard is broken. \nIf so that would explain why it did not work even if you installed a new HDD...\n\nA: Same issue here. I located the problem in the BIOS. The reason the hard drive doesn't get detected is because the BIOS just doesn't understand how to boot from a usb stick (some driver missing i'm guessing) My motherboard is XFX MI-A78S-8209. \n1)If you select boot priority from the flash drive, but USB flash as second hard disk windows will start up without even talking to the flash drive first. \n2)If you set the flash drive as first hard disk in the BIOS then it wont recognize the hard drive. I used Yumi and universal boot loader to make the different USB flash drives but all combinations fail. Yumi definetely changed some of the bios options where it gave me the option to boot from three devices but still no detection of the hard drive. Having eliminate the credibility of the iso file, flash drive stability (two different flash drives ((1GB) and (4GB HP) it really doesn't leave much options besides updating the BIOS from XFX site. CPUZ will allow you to find out what your motherboard info is(free). Also Gpart from ubuntu wont recognize the hard drive either, I figured maybe a partition would help.

This is in correlation with the previous question I asked here. My aim is to create and package an application for easy installation in Ubuntu and other debian distributions. I understand that the best way to do this is by creating .deb file with which users can easily install my application on their system.\nHowever, I would also like to make sure my application is available in multiple languages. This is why I raised the question before which you can read here. In the answers that were provided, I was asked to use disutils for my packaging. I am however missing the bigger picture here.\nWhy is there a need to include a setup.py file when I distribute my application in .deb format? \nMy purpose is to ensure that users do not need to perform python setup.py to install my application but rather just click on the .deb file. I already know how to create a deb file from the excellent tutorial available here. It clearly shows how to edit rules, changelog and everything required to create a clean deb file. \nYou can look at my application source code and folder structure at Github if it helps you better understand my situation.\nPlease note I have glanced through the official python documentation found here. But I am hoping that I would get an answer which would help even a lame man understand since my knowledge is pretty poor in this regard.\n\nA: You don't actually need to use a build system to package your application.\nHowever, not using a build system will mean that you will have to write all of the functionality that a build system provides 'for free' from scratch. Not only will this be more work for you, but you'll be on your own. That is, it's much better to rely on proven tools which are well backed by an active community than starting and maintaining build and installation scripts, unless you know very well what you're doing and you purposefully want to avoid using a build system.\nA build system will also move great part of the logic to do the build and installation to the system itself, rather than on the packaging. This results in a cleaner and simpler debian/rules file, which will be much easier to maintain.\nNow for your Python app, we did not ask to use a build system on your other question, but we did recommend it. And that was distutils/distutils-extra, as they are the most common ones and with better support for Python. There are also other out there, such as autotools, but they are generally more complex to set up for Python software.\nNote that it's not either/or. That's where the confusion might come from. A build system and packaging are complementary. The packaging makes use of the build system to create the package. So it's not that by adding a e.g. setup.py file you'll force your users to use it. Rather on the contrary, you'll make it easier to create a .deb package out of your app, which users can install by just clicking it.\nSo here are the facts, you do not need to use a build system, but it will greatly help you in creating and maintaining your package. Your choice :)\n\nA: Do you want to only, ever, make your application available as a .deb package? what about people running other Linux distributions (Fedora, Gentoo) or even Windows?\nDebian's packaging philosophy allows you to package and distribute software on .debs, while also maintaining a \"pristine\" source that can be used with other distribution methods (even people downloading a tar.gz and doing python setup.py. A lot of Debian's packaging tools assume (and work best with) a source tree that adheres to standard ways of being built, be it ./configure; make; make install, python setup.py, perl Makefile.PL; make install, or what not.\nTo achieve this, Debian's packaging tools know a lot about (and work in conjunction with) building frameworks from other languages. And if you use them, you get a lot of stuff for free. One example is the i18n stuff you were mentioning on your previous question; if you do it the Python/setup.py way, your Debian package will pick up on it almost automagically. If you have source that uses ./configure and adheres to GNU standards, packaging it is really easy.\nPersonally I think the end goal is allowing you to use an existing building framework/methodology in order to help your software provide desired installation features, without locking you up into a particular way of packaging your binaries. Remember that in the Linux world, there's a lot of choice and people will appreciate your application supporting that choice by adhering to standard ways of being built.\n", "Q: Can't connect to Samsung clx-3175 laser printer I have installed Ubuntu 12.04. My computer no longer recognises my laser printer - Samsung CLX-3175 - and will not install the drivers, refusing to run the scripts downloaded from the Samsung site. How can I fix this? \n\nA: This printer should work with the Samsung CLX-3175 Foomatic/foo2qpdl driver included with Ubuntu. \nGo to system-config-printer (System -> Administration -> Printing in GNOME classic, Gear icon at the upper right of the screen -> Printers in Unity), right click your Printer and select Properties > click Change... next to the Make and Model field to see the available drivers and change it to Samsung CLX-3175. \nNormally your printer should automatically get set up with this driver when first connected with USB.\n", "Q: How to add a link group to update-alternatives?

During the install, there is an option to make Ubuntu use only free software. Is there a way to toggle this option now that it is installed? Thanks. \n\nA: It sort of depends on your definition of \"free\" (free beer, free speech, or free bird), and there are sometimes disagreements on the definitions.\nThe main setting you have is in which repository you use, stay with main and universe and avoid restricted and multiverse.\nFor a more detailed description of repositories see\nRepositories\nLicensing\nOr if you want libre, see Trisquel . Trisquel is based on Ubuntu but uses only kernel and applications the FSF considers Free as in Freedom.\n\nTrisquel is a fully free (as in \"free speech\", not merely as in \"free of charge\") GNU/Linux based operating system. It is derived from Ubuntu, but includes only free software.\n\n\nA: This is most probably what is being referred to (see bottom right):\n\n\nIs there a way to toggle this option now that it is installed? Thanks.\n\nAfter installation, here's how you can manually toggle repositories on or off to mimic the \"use only free software\" option in the boot menu of the Live CD (chosen via F6). This answer does not get into the semantics (meanings) of \"free\" :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Software Center\n\n*Go to the Edit Menu on top, click Software Sources\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the third and fourth options -- (restricted) and (multiverse) to be \"Use only free\"; turn them on to use them. Note that Ubuntu (at least the text installs) still asks you during the install, even if \"Use only free\" is not checked, to confirm whether you want to add these to your sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Another question also asked is whether you want the \"partner\" repositories (which may not have source available, so may be non-free). Disable or enable the \"Canonical Partners\" repositories under \"Other Software\" as you wish.\n\n\n", "Q: Restricting SSH users to certain access permissions Is there a method to restrict SSH users to certain access rights for certain programs (such as Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, etc), but also a method to restrict them from leaving their /home/ directories?\n\nA: Well, if you want to restrict a user to /home, ssh is not really the right tool. For example, /bin/bash is not in /home. A better tool would be something like NFS, sshfs, ftp, etc (we could debate which one to use).\nYou could build a chroot in /home, but LXC is, IMO, a better more modern tool.\nYour other option would be to write an apparmor profile. This would be somewhat similar to a chroot in that you would need to specify what a user would and would not have access to in a profile.\nWhat you would do is make a link to /bin/bash , I call it jailbash\nsudo ln /bin/bash /usr/local/jailbash\n\nYou then change the users log in shell from bash to jailbash\nsudo chsh <user>\n\nNow write an apparmor profile for jailbash. Here is an example. You will need to review and update it, but it gives you a starting point.\n", "Q: How can I connect 2 laptops using bluetooth of ubuntu 11.10 & transfer files?

Each of these pages contain a different set of widgets, and I've noticed that the 'tallest' widget in terms of vertical space defines the overall vertical size of the notebook.\nBut I'd actually like my app to resize the pages to not waste vertical space, and adapt, that is, get resized to the same vertical size as the widget they contain. This resize should happen when I select each page.\n\nHere's the sample code to generate this notebook (the example contains a widget per page for the sake of simplicity)\nSo in short, how can I dynamically resize notebook pages upon selecting them, so that their vertical space is adapted to be the same as their child widget?\n\nA: I do not know a nice answer, but I have a work-around for you:\nThe basic idea is that you need a container widget as the parent widget in each page (do not place e.g. a label directly in the page), and you can hide/show everything except the container (If you hide the container as well, the page will disappear).\nThis solution should work for otherwise arbitrary widget hierarchies. \nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\n\nclass NotebookWindow():\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.builder = Gtk.Builder()\n        self.builder.add_from_file('notebook.ui')\n        self.builder.get_object('window1').connect('delete-event',\n            Gtk.main_quit)\n        notebook = self.builder.get_object('notebook1')\n        notebook.connect(\"switch-page\", self.on_notebook1_switch_page)\n        self.on_notebook1_switch_page(notebook, None,\n                                      notebook.get_current_page())\n\n    def on_notebook1_switch_page(self, widget, label, page):\n        for p in range(widget.get_n_pages()):\n            container = widget.get_nth_page(p)\n            if not p == page:\n                for c in container.get_children():\n                    try:\n                        c.hide_all()\n                    except AttributeError:\n                        c.hide()\n            else:\n                for c in container.get_children():\n                    try:\n                        c.show_all()\n                    except AttributeError:\n                        c.show()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    notebookwindow = NotebookWindow()\n    Gtk.main()\n\nIn my original answer I recorded and re-instated the requested sizes. This does not work in general, because the requested size is only a minimal size. I would have to record a maximum size, in order for this to work, though.\n\nA: IF the actual notebook widget is not needed, but is merely a way to keep similar content together and provide a way to switch between them, then there might be better/simpler solutions. \nHere is one that was in the end used for Qreator:\nthe main idea is to use a container like a Gtk.Box (called page_box in the example below) and keep only one item visible.\nYou also need a list with the content of each page, each packed into a single widget (e.g. a Gtk.Grid).\nfor page in page_list:\n    self.ui.page_box.add(page.grid)\n\nHere page_list is a simple list of page objects, where the page object has a grid property (the Gtk.Grid containing all the page content). \nAt last, you need to provide a way to switch between the contents, e.g. with a set of buttons, each calling a switch method with the corresponding page_id when clicked:\ndef switch_view(self, page_id):\n    # hide all pages\n    for child in self.ui.page_box.get_children():\n        child.hide()\n    # show the single page that is active\n    self.ui.page_box.get_children()[page_id].show()\n\nThis is not a literal answer to the question, but it might solve the same problem.\n", "Q: Locale variables have no effect in remote shell (perl: warning: Setting locale failed.)

My solution was to comment the SendEnv lines in /etc/ssh/ssh_config (since these cannot be overriden), and to add the following entry in ~/.ssh/config:\nHost *,!<somehost>\n    SendEnv LANG LC_CTYPE LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME LC_COLLATE LC_MONETARY LC_MESSAGES\n    SendEnv LC_PAPER LC_NAME LC_ADDRESS LC_TELEPHONE LC_MEASUREMENT\n    SendEnv LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_ALL LANGUAGE\n    SendEnv XMODIFIERS    \n\nwith <somehost> being the hostname to which I didn't want to send any environment variable.\n\nA: This can happen sometimes on fresh minimal/alternate installs or in other situations. The fix is pretty simple. Try these, in the following order, testing after each to see if the situation is fixed:\n1. Reconfigure locales\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales\n\n*\n\n*if that doesn't work,\n\n\n\n2. Reinstall locale language-pack\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get --reinstall install language-pack-de\n\n*\n\n*if that doesn't work,\n\n\n\n3. Manually force locale settings (persistent)\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo update-locale LC_ALL=de_DE.UTF-8 LANG=de_DE.UTF-8\n\nA: That's because your locale in your local machine is set to German, which SSH forwards to and tries to use on the server, but your server does not have it installed.\nYou've got several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generate the locale. Generate the German locale on the server with sudo locale-gen de.\n\n*Stop forwarding locale from the client. Do not forward the locale environment variable from your local machine to the server. You can comment out the SendEnv LANG LC_* line in the local /etc/ssh/ssh_config file.\n\n*Stop accepting locale on the server.  Do not accept the locale environment variable from your local machine to the server. You can comment out the AcceptEnv LANG LC_* line in the remote /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.\n\n*Set the server locale to English. Explicitly set the locale to English on the server. As an example, you can add the following lines to your remote ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile files:\nexport LANGUAGE=\"en\"\nexport LANG=\"C\"\nexport LC_MESSAGES=\"C\"\n\nIf you don't have root access to the server, the Stop forwarding locale from the client option might be the best (and only) way to go. \n\nA: Comment the line SendEnv LANG LC_* in /etc/ssh/ssh_config, so it should looks like:\n#SendEnv LANG LC_*\n\n\nA: The Problem\nBy default, the ssh client command forwards locale-related environment variables to the SSH server. That's specified in /etc/ssh/ssh_config on the client side:\nHost *\n    SendEnv LANG LC_*\n\nAnd by default, the SSH server happens to accept them (in  /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the server):\nAcceptEnv LANG LC_CTYPE LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME LC_COLLATE LC_MONETARY LC_MESSAGES\nAcceptEnv LC_PAPER LC_NAME LC_ADDRESS LC_TELEPHONE LC_MEASUREMENT\nAcceptEnv LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_ALL LANGUAGE\n\nSo, if there are locale-related environment variables in your shell, they will be populated to the SSH session on the server side.\nUnfortunately, the SendEnv option is cumulative. According to man 5 ssh_config:\n SendEnv\n         ... Multiple environment variables may be separated\n         by whitespace or spread across multiple SendEnv directives.  The\n         default is not to send any environment variables.\n\nwhich means it can't be overridden.\nThe Solution\nSometimes it's impossible or unwise to change a system-wide configuration, especially on the server side. However, you may bypass it. And that's the side effect of the -F option in ssh command. According to man ssh:\n -F configfile\n         Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a con-\n         figuration file is given on the command line, the system-wide\n         configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config) will be ignored.  The\n         default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.\n\nBy default the per-user configuration file ~/.ssh/config is used if it presents. But you can explicitly specify it on the command line to bypass /etc/ssh/ssh_config:\n$ touch ~/.ssh/config\n$ ssh -F ~/.ssh/config your_user@your_host\n\nIt would be more convenient if you make an alias in ~/.bashrc:\nalias ssh=\"ssh -F ~/.ssh/config\"\n\nThis way, the default SendEnv directives in system-wide configuration are not effective, making no environment variables be sent to the SSH server by default.\n\nA: This is fixed in OpenSSH 7.8, i.e. older than the current version in\nDebian stable.  The documentation now includes:\n\nIt is possible to clear previously set SendEnv variable\n               names by prefixing patterns with -.  The default is not to\n               send any environment variables.\n\nSee #573316\n\nA: I was facing the issue that I attributed to ssh passing the locale settings, so I tried with disabling it on client site, then on server site as well and still the locale was complaining after logging in.\nTurned out to be a messy locale on the destination server itself, where the setting was taken from /etc/default/locale\nI had to clean it completely, and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales which fixed the issue.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall Ubuntu Wubi? I want to uninstall Ubuntu because I just don't like it...  I have windows 7 and no boot disk or anything special to uninstall, when I installed Ubuntu it said easy to uninstall and I would love to know how to actually uninstall it. Thank You.\n\nA: The \"easy to uninstall\" part implies that you did a Wubi install, which is the easiest to remove.  A Wubi install is performed by booting Windows then inserting the Ubuntu Installation CD in the drive.  The autorun will then prompt you to start the Ubuntu Wubi installation (install inside Windows). There is also a Wubi installer that can be downloaded and run while online that installs direcly off the internet.\nTo Uninstall the Wubi installation from Windows 7 follow these steps:\n1) Boot Windows 7\n2) Open \"Programs and Features\" in the Control Panel\n3) Find the entry for \"Ubuntu\"\n4) Uninstall Ubuntu\nNote that in step (3) above, if you can't find the listing for Ubuntu then you might have performed an install \"alongside of\" Windows, in which case it would have re-arranged your partitions.  It seems likely that you have done a Wubi install however.\nYes, Ubuntu is different from Windows.  If it was the same it couldn't be better, only \"as good as...\".  Perhaps you'll have another look sometime.\n\nA: I will hate my answer since I always tend to tell people to use Ubuntu and give a chance (Either adapting to the new ways of using it or checking if the benefits it offers over Windows outweigh the amount of problems they face on a daily basis with Windows)\nLIVECD\nAssuming you install Ubuntu using the LiveCD (not Wubi), the fastest way is to use the Windows 7 CD/DVD. Boot from it and select \"Repair your computer\". Then from a repair prompt execute the following line to replace the Grub bootloader: bootrec /fixmbr\nThat will eliminate the bootable part of GRUB and reinstall the Windows 7 Boot way. After that you will have to remove the Ubuntu partition or partitions created with it. You can later merge them with Windows or install Ubuntu in case you feel you made a mistake ^^.\nWUBI\nGo to Control Panel, Uninstall a program (Vista/7) or Add/remove programs (XP), and double-click on the Ubuntu entry to automatically uninstall. Reference.\n\nIf this does not work, or for more information about Wubi uninstallation (or general Wubi information), follow the instructions to manually remove Wubi\nIn any case I would give Ubuntu a chance, at least a 1 week test drive. Of course, remember to update everything since 12.04 has many changes that need updates after a fresh installation. I could mention the MANY benefits of using Ubuntu but I leave it to you to feel the force.\nLuring Link - Benefits of Ubuntu - Google Search (Feel the force)\n\nA: If you installed Ubuntu from Windows, using Wubi, then you can simply use the normal Windows uninstall ability (add/remove programs or something similar).  But, if you installed it alongside Windows, using a normal install, then removing Ubuntu will leave you with an unbootable system, which can be fixed using a Windows repair disk, but it's not something most people know how to do - plus, you need the Windows repair disk.\nSo, before listening to anyone suggesting that you delete the Ubuntu partition, make sure you understand what the next steps are.\nThe gory details:  installing Linux alongside Windows requires that you replace the normal windows/Dos boot loader code that is in the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the disk.  This little bit of code knows to look in a certain place for the rest of what it needs, but deleting the partition with Linux will delete this code, too.  So, the MBR must be restored if you do this.\n\nA: I've never done this before, but I this is what I would do:\nStep 1 - Give a second chance to Ubuntu. I this fails, go to step 2.\nStep 2 - First, backup everything just in case. Secind, reboot your computer with an Ubuntu Live CD. Open the \"GParted Partition Editor\" to remove Ubuntu.\nI can't give you detailed steps because I never did this. But I hope this answer can help you a little bit.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 upgrade and thunderbird After applying the suggested updates (179) an error message at the very end of the process suggested me to run apt-get install -f.  \nSince it is a fairly new Ubuntu install (x86) I didn't setup anything in Thunderbird yet.

So, the ubuntu CD let me choose whether or not I want to install Gnome/unity on my current system and at a latter stage when my installation is complete I can manually install Xfce or LXDE.\nAlso is this the correct way to install other desktop environments or one should first do a complete install of ubuntu and than remove and install a DE of his choice.So, if this is not the correct way than can you please point me to the correct way to achieve the other option I mentioned.\nPlease give UBUNTU specific anwers because I know I can get the above configuration using Xubuntu or Lubuntu.\n\nA: \nPlease give UBUNTU specific anwers because I know I can get the above configuration using Xubuntu or Lubuntu.\n\nFirstly: Xubuntu is Ubuntu with xfce instead of unity.

I want to install Ubuntu but I do not want it to affect all users; the others do not want it.  Is it possible to have Ubuntu only installed for one user (without affecting others)?\n\nA: The only way to do what you are asking would be to run Ubuntu in a virtual machine.\nTo do this \n1, Download Ubuntu, and a VM tool like Virtual Box Link Here\n2, Install Ubuntu saving the VDI file to a user specific directory (like your home folder). As long as other users don't have access to your home folder, they won't be able to run your Virtual Ubuntu machine.\n\nA: Ubuntu is an operating system that runs your computer. This is different from an application where you can choose per user what programs will run or not. So once your computer boots into Ubuntu the whole machine will run on Ubuntu.\nIf you only want to try out Ubuntu you could install it in a Virtual Machine that will run like an application on a per user basis. But this will be at the cost of performance for Ubuntu of course.\nWhat you can do if only you but not other users want to run on Ubuntu is to set up a dual boot with your primary OS. This can be configured in a way that your primary OS will be booted per default. Only if somebody, i.e you, wants to boot Ubuntu you will have to press a key during boot-up to select a different OS (Ubuntu in this case).\n\nSo my answer is yes, you can install Ubuntu for yourself and have the alternative OS for other users (almost) unchanged.\n\nYou should however ask the other user if that is o.k. with them, and you definitely have to back up the whole system before you install Ubuntu to be able to restore the previous settings in case something goes wrong. Installing a dual boot Ubuntu involves changes to the harddisk partition which is a potential risk to the data on it.  You may also want to think about a separate hard drive just for Ubuntu to not put the data of the other users at risk.\nAnother fact you might want to know is that Ubuntu replaces a bootloader by it's own (Grub). Therefore when removing Ubuntu we also need to resotore the original bootloader. For e.g. Windows you will need an installation or a repair CD to do so.\n\nA: \nis it possible to have Ubuntu only installed onto one user?\n\nNo, you cannot install Ubuntu without affecting the ENTIRE computer, and therefore all users using it.\nWhy?\nLet me explain: whether you install Ubuntu from Windows (Wubi), or alongside Windows by booting from an Ubuntu Live-CD, Ubuntu will make three changes that will affect the entire computer and all its users:\n\n*\n\n*It will change the way the computer starts up (in technical terms, modify the bootloader)\n\n*It will occupy a significant amount of hard disk space (at least 4 gigabytes or so.)\n\n*While Ubuntu is running, the other users cannot login to Windows (because it cannot run at the same time as Ubuntu).\n\nMinimally-invasive installation: run in a virtual machine\nI assume you are using Windows. If you have administrative rights, you can try installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine using VirtualBox or VMWare Player. Both are free. But this can also affect users in two ways:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu will still occupy a significant amount of hard disk space (at least 4 gigabytes or so.)\n\n*Running a virtual machine will also use a significant amount of RAM (at least 1024 MB recommended) and some CPU (processor) time, which can affect the responsiveness of the system for other users using it without you logging out.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu is an operating system. You can't access to Ubuntu with the users of Windows or Mac OS or other OS.\n", "Q: Can't copy my music from Rhythmbox to my iPhone I am using Rhythmbox (2.96) using a iphone 4.2.1.

Learned a lot - but Im still having some issues regarding my two gateway setup, which I really want to accomplish.\nI have two gateways, for various reasons and I am trying to get the two NICs to behave. My problem is with the secondary Gateway (Gateway2), since everything works with Gateway1 and eth0, default route and everything.\nSo first off, my setup looks somewhat like this:\nNAT (in) = Cisco ASA\nNAT (out)= Zyxel whatever \nWAN-IP\nNAT (in) -  -  - - - - - - - - Ubuntu Box 12.04 - - - - - - - - - - - - NAT (out)\nGateway1\n10.0.0.1  <-> 10.0.0.50 (eth0) || (eth1) 192.168.0.50 <-> 192.168.0.1\n. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Gateway2\n\nSo I went to:\n1.\nCreate new table  : \"1  zyxelwan\"\nwithin \"/etc/iproute2/rt_tables\"\n2.\nCreate routing policy for table (zyxelwan) \n ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 dev eth1 src 192.168.0.50 table zyxelwan\n\n ip route add default via 192.168.0.1 dev eth1 table zyxelwan\n\n3.\nSet the IP rules which makes use of the newly-created routing table:\n ip rule add from 192.168.0.50 table zyxelwan\n\n ip rule add to 192.168.0.50 table zyxelwan\n\nI have left out other configurations (for now) to ensure that I was running lighest-possible-config. And it is as if my ip rules are being completely ignored, see here some of the outputs I get after the above mentioned steps.\n route -n\n\n Kernel IP routing table\n\n Destination    Gateway         Genmask        Flag Metric  Ref     Use Iface\n\n 0.0.0.0        10.0.0.1        0.0.0.0         UG  100      0        0 eth0\n\n 10.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0\n\n 192.168.0.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1\n\nCannot see the table Ive configured, but if I try to apply the routing commands to the table again, I get \"file already exists\". So the config should be there somewhere.\nBut when I try to tracepath i.e. 8.8.8.8, I get this result:\n tracepath 8.8.8.8\n\n 1:  10.0.0.50                                            0.161ms pmtu 1500\n\nSo I tried to delete the gateway, from which it tried to send the traffic (10.0.0.1) - with this result (This should seems to be regardless my ip rules & table).:\n tracepath 8.8.8.8\n\n 1:  send failed\n\n Resume: pmtu 65535\n\nAnd if I write the route, ommiting the table, and replace the previous default route with:\n route add default via 192.168.0.1 dev eth1\n\nIt will ofc work,but id really like being able to SSH/VPN into the Ubuntubox from my Cisco Gateway and then access the network on my Zyxel Gateway -   Am I missing something dreadfully obvious, or are you smart ppl out there able to point me in the right direction?\nI was thinking according my ip rules, it could be as if it only \"listens\" for traffic, and will direct it out the same interface - according to the table/ip rules - and the solution might just have been \"switching the cables around\"?\nAnyhow, thank you in advance for any suggestions :) \n\nA: I resolved the issue, by forcing a bind on the local ip of eth0, of OpenVPN - afterwards, I created another routing table for eth0.\nI then added a default gateway for eth1 as well, the regular way - no table :)\nThank you for having taken time to look at my original post :)\n\nA: The old route command isn't able to properly represent any of the fancy stuff you are doing with the new ip route command. To show the routing configuration, use ip route list table [xx|all] instead of route.\n", "Q: Cd writer not showing in ftab Hi I'm using the april edition of ubuntu 12.04\nWhen i try to use my cd it's not detected\n It shows up in disk manager, it is not listed in fstab,when \ni did a checkdisk for devise it gave the following \nDetected CD-R drive: /dev/sr0\nUsing /dev/cdrom of unknown capabilities\nDevice type    : Removable CD-ROM\nVersion        : 5\nResponse Format: 2\nCapabilities   : \nVendor_info    : 'HL-DT-ST'\nIdentification : 'CD-ROM GCR-8523B'\nRevision       : '1.02'\nDevice seems to be: Generic mmc CD-ROM.\nwodim: Sorry, no CD/DVD-Recorder or unsupported CD/DVD-Recorder found on this target.\nCan anyone tell me what is happening, as everything worked before updating\nfrom 11.10\nThanks !\n\nA: Pay no attention to fstab, it isn't supposed to be listed there.\nYour drive is only a CD-ROM; it can not write discs.\n", "Q: Cannot ssh into Ubuntu Server by hostname I just set up Ubuntu 12.04 Server on an old box laying around, connected to my router via ethernet. I set up openssh-server as instructed for remote access, but I cannot ssh into it from my laptop using the hostname. \nStrangely though, I can ssh into it using the IP address. I would really like to fix this for the sake of convenience. I notice there are a few similar questions, but it seems all these people had some idea of what direction to go in to fix the problem, and were asking slightly more specific, technically-worded versions of my questions.\nAs a complete beginner to home networking, I would majorly appreciate if someone would tell me where to go from here.\n\nA: I had a similar problem and tried to solve it installing Avahi-daemon, just as roadmr suggested, but with apparently no result. Then I typed\nhost myhostname\n\nand the terminal answered me:\nmyhostname.lan has address 192.168.1.68\nHost myhostname.lan not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)\n\nIn the guest machine Iused as hostname myhostname.lan and it just worked. Until I am connected with DHCP. With assigned IP it does not work...\n\nA: Unless you configure hostnames in a central location, there's no way for your laptop to know the hostname you configured on the Ubuntu server.\nSo if when you installed the ubuntu server you named it \"bonkers\", it's understandable that on the laptop ssh bonkers will not do anything, as the laptop has no idea about that hostname.\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your laptop (you didn't say which OS it is running?) add a line in the /etc/hosts file for your Ubuntu server's IP address, something like this (use the actual IP from your Ubuntu server):\n10.15.30.41   ubuntu-server\nThen you can do ssh ubuntu-server and it should work. Note that the location of the hosts file depends on which OS your laptop has; I'm not sure where it is on Windows, for example.\n\n*Install the avahi-daemon package on your Ubuntu server. This utilizes the mDNS protocol to \"advertise\" its hostname on your local network. Once it's installed and running, you should be able to ssh ubuntu-server.local (notice the .local domain) and access the server. Again, if your laptop is running Windows, I can't say if it supports mDNS; I know Ubuntu (and any other Linux with avahi-daemon installed) and Mac OS X support it out of the box.\n", "Q: 12.04 failed install \nPossible Duplicate:\n“Unknown keyword in configuration file Boot:” error when booting off a live USB  \n\nRunning 9.04 (see launchpad question #198606).

Non-minimized windows in workspaces appear as white boxes inside the workspace, and a maximized window will appear as a white box (although without the program icon inside as I am used to with programs such as eclipse and firefox). The active window does have a very slight glow inside it, but if your active window is small (e.g. a terminal window, calculator, nautilus, upgrade-manager, etc) it is difficult to discern this as the borders don't change, the interior of the box just gets a shade lighter.   \nThere is no indication at all of which workspace you are on and I'd like to restore this functionality as currently there is no way to differentiate between maximized windows (as both the program icon and the active workspace highlight functionalities are gone).  \n\nThis shows an image of my workspace switcher.

I tried grub2 into a MBR as well but it would not install there...\n\nA: If Windows is installed to and booting from an MBR-partitioned disk, then that means that Windows is booting in BIOS mode. On most computers, it's very awkward to switch between boot modes, so if Windows is booting in BIOS mode, it's best to install Linux in BIOS mode, too. My suspicion is that you have instead done an EFI-mode installation of Ubuntu. There are at least two ways you can proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wipe your Ubuntu installation and re-install in BIOS mode. The trick will be to boot the installer in BIOS mode. The problem is that different EFI implementations provide different controls for how to set a CD's boot mode (BIOS vs. EFI), so I can't provide step-by-step instructions for this; you'll just have to study your firmware options or the computer's/motherboard's manual.\n\n*Boot your installer into BIOS mode, or use a BIOS-mode rescue system such as SystemRescueCd, and use it to install a BIOS version of GRUB. This will go best if you create a BIOS Boot Partition, which is a ~1 MiB partition in which GRUB stores some of its code. (You can carve it out of your /dev/sdb1, which will be useless if you follow this route.) There are plenty of online guides describing how to re-install GRUB to a non-booting system, but I don't happen to have any URLs handy, so you should do a Web search.\n\n\nNote that Linux is perfectly happy to boot from a GPT disk in BIOS mode, although Windows can't do this. Also, some firmware implementations have problems with this setup, so it's conceivable you'll run into difficulties if you try to follow it.

I use a Gtk.IconView widget in my app to select different types of elements. The way the IconView works is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do one click to select the item\n\n*Do an additional double-click to activate the item\n\n\nI've always found it confusing that an additional double click is needed, when most button-like widgets in the desktop just require a single click. Now I've just had feedback from a couple of users that find it confusing (someone thought it was a bug that clicking on the button \"did nothing\"), so I've decided to look into how to change that behaviour.\nIdeally, I'd like the IconView to behave as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hover to select an item (optional)\n\n*Single-click activates the item\n\n\nNow I haven't found anything obvious in the widget's properties to make it behave like that. Does anyone know how or if that could be achieved?\n\n\nA: One solution (but only for the single click activation) is of cause to use the selection_changed signal of the IconView (because the IconView selection is single click based). \nA sample that assumes a working on_item_activated signal would be:\ndef on_icon_view_selection_changed(self, widget):\n        self.on_item_activated(widget, widget.get_selected_items()[0])\n\n\nA: A GtkIconView is not an arrangement of button widgets into a table. It is basically a special case of GtkTreeView, with items laid out in a grid, rather than a list/tree. To do highlight of items on hover, I believe a patch to GTK+ would be required. A patch would also be required to add API to enable single-click vs. double-click to activate, however, this feature can be implemented on top of the existing widget API, by listening to the button_press_event signal on the widget, and acting accordingly.\n\nA: You seem to explore the limitations of Gtk lately :-)\nFirst of all, dobeys answer seems correct.\nTree- and List-Stores are a good choice for collections. Larger amounts of data which are identical in type but different in meta-content (e.g. a music collection where every piece has an artist, album, title, but the actual artist name, album name, title name changes). \nThe good thing about these widgets is that they are easily sortable, many items can be selected (e.g. in 'rubber-band' mode), and you need relatively few lines of code to add thousands of similar items. \nChanging the way a TreeView or ListView behaves to clicks / hover etc on a per application level is a bad idea, because it messes with the way users expect your application to behave. You found that out yourself based on the reaction you describe in your question. \nYour problem however is that users did not understand that your widget is a TreeView / ListView, instead they thought that they are a number of buttons. And that seems to make sense, based on your screenshot. \nButtons are meant to start an action (e.g. stop, play, pause) or communicate with the program (e.g. Ok, Cancel) or even act as a link to a different view (see LinkButton). They don't normally have an (abstract) object or item associated with it (e.g. ' \"Sammy Davis Jr\" by \"Movits!\" from the album \"Out of my head\" '). \nSo, while the not-configurable click behaviour is a shortcoming of gtk, it should anyway only be on a per-user global level. \nWhat you want is probably a grid with Buttons. (Buttons can also contain icons). \n\nA: Here's how I made my Iconview respond to pointer position to get a hover effect and single left-click and right-click actions. \nYou have to activate pointer-motion-notify for the widget, and then convert x,y position of pointer to the path of the iconview:\n...\n    self.iconview.add_events(Gdk.EventMask.POINTER_MOTION_MASK)\n    self.iconview.connect(\"item-activated\", self.iv_icon_activated)\n    self.iconview.connect(\"button-press-event\", self.on_mouse_click)\n    self.iconview.connect(\"motion-notify-event\", self.on_pointer_motion)\n\ndef on_pointer_motion(self, widget, event):\n    path= self.iconview.get_path_at_pos(event.x, event.y)\n    if path !=None:\n            self.iconview.select_path(path)\n    #If we're outside of an item, deselect all items (turn off highlighting)\n    if path == None:\n        self.iconview.unselect_all()\n\ndef on_mouse_click(self,widget, event):\n    if event.type == Gdk.EventType.BUTTON_PRESS:\n        path=self.iconview.get_selected_items()[0]\n       #if right click activate a pop-up menu\n        if event.button == 3 and path != None:\n            self.popup.popup(None, None, None, None, event.button, event.time)\n       #if left click, activate the item to execute\n        if event.button == 1 and path != None:\n            self.iv_icon_activated(widget, path)\n\n", "Q: mpirun -np N, what if N is larger than my core number? Say I have a 4-core workstation, what would linux (Ubuntu) do if I execute\nmpirun -np 9 XXX\nQ1. Will 9 run immediately together, or they will run 4 after 4?\nQ2. I suppose that using 9 is not good, because the remainder 1, it will make the computer confused, (I don't know is it going to be confused at all, or the \"head\" of the computer will decide which core among the 4 cores will be used?) Or it will be randomly picked. Who decide which one core to call?\nQ3. If I feel my cpu is not bad and my ram is okay and large enough, and my case is not very big. Is it a good idea in order to fully use my cpu and ram, that I do mpirun -np 8 XXX, or even mpirun -np 12 XXX.\nQ4. Who decides all of these effciency optimization, Ubuntu, or linux, or motherboard or cpu?\nYour enlightenment would be really appreciated.\n\nA: *\n\n*9 will run simultaneously.\n\n*There is no confusion for the remaining 1 process; mpirun schedules in round-robin order by default, so the 1st core/node will be assigned that process.\n\n*You can certainly increase np beyond the number of available physical cores/nodes. The tradeoff is that the overhead increases with a larger number of processes than cores/nodes. If your code is not tightly CPU-bound (e.g. requires significant IO wait time), you should do this. Ultimately, you don't know if it will be faster until you try.\n\n*MPI does the initial scheduling, but for more than one process per node, or just in general (since there are a number of other processes running in the background too), the Linux kernel scheduler takes over.\n\n\nSee this man page for much more information.\n\nA: 9 immediatly. \nIf not, the universe's size will be incorrect. All the processes must exist at the same time or won't be visible for the other instances. \nIf your instance's memory is too high you can manually stop the other 5 processes until the other 4 have finished tho.\nHowever, if you're using MPI in that way ( only for your local machine ), let me recommend you OpenMP/tbb instead. MPI is really designed to distribute the app across multiple network computers or cluster nodes.\n\nA: Yes, you would need to modify the code significantly to turn it from an MPI application to an OpenMP or TBB application.  If your application has already been developed, try it and make performance measurements before doing anything that drastic.  \n", "Q: after Bios screen appears, the purple screen appears with a red circle and a white line through it, saying cannot load Ubuntu 2D After the Bios screen appears, the purple screen appears and says, \"cannot load Ubuntu2D\" Log off. Logging off is my only option. I am operating on a Dell Insoirion 11.10 Ubuntu system. I deleted the gnome because I read in the forum it slowed down the computer and I wanted to watch movies. I deleted Unity as well because I read terrible things about it and that it was not necessary for me. I realize my experimention in learning by adding and deleting things were not proper. I was just trying to learn and fix my sound. Please help. Thanks. \n\nA: So If I understand correctly you seemed to have removed gnome and unity. And now you get a message saying Unity 2D doesn't load. Please do not remove stuff if you do not understand the importance of it. It is difficult to understand your scenario, but you seemed to have removed major components of your desktop. \nYou can try installing Unity back again by following the steps below,\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+F1 to enter into the tty terminal.\n\n*Login into your account by entering your credentials.\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install unity\n\n*Then type sudo reboot. Enter the password and reboot your computer\n\n*You should now be able to login into your desktop using Unity\n\n\nHowever I strongly recommend that you reinstall Ubuntu on your system since you might have removed other important packages.\nTip: Do not follow instructions on the web without understanding them. If you had asked on AskUbuntu, you wouldn't have faced this issue. My personal recommendation is to stick with Unity (it is good by the way), use it and the judge it yourself instead of what you read on the internet. And once you are comfortable and know in and outs of Ubuntu then try experimenting with it.\n", "Q: Does the Software Centre provide a DRM/licensing scheme? Does Ubuntu's Software Centre include a DRM/licensing mechanism so that applications can only be installed and run by the people who purchase them?\nI'm thinking of something similar to Apple's where only a user with a particular AppleID can use software they purchase through the App Store.\nIf there is nothing built in, are there any solutions available to developers to implement something similar in their applications?\n\nA: The Ubuntu Store does not implement DRM/licensing as a policy; that goes against the ethos of free software (upon which Linux/Ubuntu are founded).\nCommercial apps may choose to implement some type of DRM/licensing, that is up to the individual authors. Otherwise, most such authors rely on the honor system -- that a user will only use the app if you have paid for it.  \nFrom developer.ubuntu.com:  \n\nThere is no native DRM framework within Ubuntu so there is no\n  system-wide restrictions. We do not believe that DRM is a successful\n  formula because  it punishes law-abiding users and doesn’t stop the\n  minority of pirates.

There are URI setting of which i am not much familiar. Does anybody has an idea or was able to get it run?\n\nA: I am using 12.04 on a Windows network and this is what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the bizhub 423 Linux drivers from here.\n\n*Add new printer and select the Konica Minolta 423 (it should appear as a network printer).\n\n*Ubuntu will search for drivers, but eventually will ask you to provide a PPD.

You may need to replace 192.168.1.3 with whatever your printer's IP address is, but once I got this right it was printing.\n\n\nA: This is just to inform you that this procedure works fine under Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. There was no driver for our Konica Minolta Bizhub c224e, but I selected the driver \"KONICA MINOLTA 500/420/360PS(P)\" that was available on the list and works like a charm printing in full colour. \nJust remember to change Device URI from the default one to something like lpd://10.1.0.13/print - you can check the IP address in the menu on the printer display.\nAnother trick is to know what printer options are installed and enable them in the driver's menus.

Im using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. \nI don't know if it makes a difference but CPU's architecture is 64bit (Intel i3).\n\nA: You don't install OpenMP. OpenMP is a feature of the compiler. Check that the compiler you are using implements OpenMP, which is an API for parallel programming in C/C++/Fortran.\nCheck with the OpenMP website, openmp.org for a list of compilers and platforms that support OpenMP programming.\n\nA: sudo apt install libomp-dev\napt show libomp-dev\nDescription: LLVM OpenMP runtime - dev package\n The runtime is the part of the OpenMP implementation that your code is\n linked against, and that manages the multiple threads in an OpenMP program\n while it is executing.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu Server have a Trash? I'm using the server version of Ubuntu. I was wondering if files still go into the \"trash\" etc. with this version.\nI'm been deleting stuff and I just want to make sure the stuff is not being put into the trash.\n\nA: No trash in the Server version. The rm command deletes it.\n\nA: You do not say how you delete files.\nThere could be a \"trash\" if you use some text mode file manager, for example.\nBut let's assume you use the rm command in the shell:\nNormally, rm should just delete files, without using a \"trash\". But for various reasons, like installing something accidentally, or using an example .bashrc without checking, it could be something else - it's easy to check, so you should: Use command -v to find out what command you're running with the name rm:\n$ command -v rm\n/usr/bin/rm\n\nThat looks good (1). Equally, /bin/rm would be good.\nIf rm is changed to use trash, it may look like this:\n$ command -v rm       \nalias rm=trash-put\n\nor\n$ command -v rm       \nalias rm=gvfs-trash\n\nNormally, this change is only applied when rm is used in an interactive shell.\nAlso, you may check whether libtrash is installed in some way. It changes how progams  work, including rm,  on library call level.\n\n\n(1) Actually, /usr/bin/rm may be safe-rm, from a package of the same name:\n$ ls -l /usr/bin/rm\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Feb  1  2014 /usr/bin/rm -> safe-rm\n\n\nAnswering a question from a comment:\nIf winscp is an implementation of scp, then you can not delete files with it; You copy files to another machine, so you get more copies.

I have configured port-forwarding, but that's the only think I can think is causing the \"Connection Refused\" error... My router is a WRT120N and I have configured it for port-forwarding based on Portforward.com, which seems somewhat outdated since some of those images are not exactly like what my router settings look like, but I have tried multiple ways for setting the portforwarding up, and I know that forwarding for port 80 works because my server has HTTP access which is working...\nAlso VPN access was getting blocked in what I believe to be a similar way, so the solution to the SSH port 22 being blocked might also be similar to that of the VPN being blocked as well.\nAny ideas?\nThanks!\n\nA: I solved this problem by reinstalling openssh-server as follows:\nsudo apt-get purge openssh-server \nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\n\nA: Check the SSH service status and start the SSH service if it is stopped:\nsudo service ssh status\n\nIn my case SSH was stopped, but after starting the service:\nsudo service ssh start\n\nI can be able to remote login to Linux.\n\nA: Just to share. \n(might be with different configuration)\nIn my case, I found that that error can happen because I have not install openssh-server in the other machine.\nAfter I install openssh-server in the other machine, the problem:\nssh: connect to host 192.168.XXX.XXX port 22: Connection refused\n\nis solved.\n\nA: *\n\n*First check openssh-server installed in that system.\n\n\n*check the status of ssh service, make ssh service start.\n sudo service ssh status    \n sudo service ssh start\n\n\n\n*Check whether port 22 in that system is blocked by iptables.

Port forward 2222 (or whatever), and try again.\n\nA: I got the same error, but, after restarting my computer, everything worked again.\nSo, you may want to give it a try before reinstalling some components.\n\nA: The other likely cause is that the proxy in between the terminal-session and the host-server needs userid-password access, that it is rejecting to allow the traffic flow, this is due to a network-firewall or ssl-socks etc.\n\nA: The solution will be by adding the port number of your server preceded with \"-p\":\nExample of the command line:\nssh -L localport:127.0.0.1:localport username@ServerIP **-p** **serverport**\n\n\nA: Just go to whm then  open Host Access Control \nChange as follows \nsshd ALL allow\n\nA: If it's your own private server, your best course of action is to start simple and not complicate things.

Or can I find it on any OS???\nWhat can be the reason to put this logo into the special-characters of Unicode set?\n\nA: I'm afraid not. U+F200 is in the Private Use Area (E000—F8FF range). These are not official Unicode characters.\n\nA: Since I came across the same question as the OP and things have changed since the accepted answer was posted, I thought I'd share my findings:\nBoth Ubuntu logos (shown correctly below, if font is installed) are in fact \"normal\" characters now.

I've got a dev box running 10.10 Desktop, and I'd like to start over with a fresh 12.04 install. I figure this would be cleaner than a series of upgrades through all the intermediate installs. It can't hurt to clean out the crud that I've tinkered with along the way too.\nMost if not all my materials are on an mdadm RAID 1 pair mounted at /data. This includes a set of gitosis-served git repositories, which at at /data/git; in order to do this, I moved the gitosis user's home dir to /data/git.\nMy plan is to do a clean install, re-assemble the RAID, recreate the gitosis user etc.\nMy main question is about permissions. What happens to the permissions for directories on the RAID device? I assume that they will end up tied to UIDs of users that don't exist.   Do I just have to go back through chown-ing and chgrp-ing them to bring them back into line with what was there before? Or is there a clean way to map them back to new users of the same name?\nAs an aside, i've rsynced a copy of / (excluding /data) to a backup dir on the RAID device (and most likely will to an external too). Is that enough to ensure I've got all my old config files etc in case i need to refer back to them?\nAny insight appreciated.\nthanks,\nHugh\n\nA: The raid is irrelevant.  When you reinstall, you just need to make sure you recreate the users/groups with the same IDs, or chown all of the files to their new IDs.  The simplest thing to do is backup your /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group, and /etc/gshadow files to preserve all of the existing accounts as-is.\n", "Q: How to let maas' cloud-init client select internal mirror?

The reason for hiding root is that in most cases you don't need root access. The analog in Windows would be having to authenticate when you want to install a driver; in Ubuntu you have to be root or have root privileges.\nThere are two ways for you to get access as root. You can type:\nsudo <whatever-command> and Ubuntu will ask you for your password and then execute that command as root.\nOR\nsudo su, where you'll input your own password and then you will become root (i.e. you will be logged in as root).\nI prefer the latter because it gives me more control; sometimes running a command just as root isn't enough, but doing it this way can be more dangerous (i.e. you could accidentally cause more damage). \nI recommend trying the first way. And then trying the second way if  that doesn't work. Just make sure you get out of root after you're done (i.e. type exit after you're finished doing what you need to do as root).\n\nA: If you have enabled the root account you can use\nsu\n\nEnter the password for root, cd to your application folder, then run\n./package.run\n\n", "Q: How to prevent WLAN connection from dropping permanently on a Fritz USB WLAN N stick? I have a desktop with a Fritz USB WLAN N stick and tried Ubuntu 12.04. Installation went fine and WLAN is working. However, connection drops permanent. Reconnecting manually fixes it but after a few minutes it drops again. It's connected to a Vodafone 802 box with WLAN N fix set. It seems that it works when I switch off N mode. But I need to test. Can someone confirm this issue or is there another solution?\nI have another machine with 12.04 (HP 625 laptop) running where connection is stable.\n\nA: Perhaps a dupe here. The tricks below worked for me a day but now they are again not working, irritating! So this case is not resolved at least with Thinkpad X220.\nI.

The latter apparently works for Intel Ultimate-N 6300.

This article shows me how to see if Ubuntu has encrypted swap. What I would like to know is how I can determine that swap (or any other partition) is truly encrypted. What I would like to see is that some disk utility tries to read the encrypted contents, showing me gibberish, but after inputting the correct passphrase, it shows me the files as expected.\nThis would be difficult for swap since crypttab uses a random key, but I /should/ be able to see the gibberish that indicates that it is encrypted.\nEDIT: I'm adding the output from testdisk.

How can I verify that this partition is really encrypted?\n\nA: You can boot a live CD and try almost any data recovery tool, such as testdisk. When you run the data recovery tool it will identify all sorts of files. Open any of them and you will see random data.\n\nA: Short general answer\nYou can't. The goal of encryption is to make valid data look like gibberish, i. e. as indistinguishable from random data as possible.\nLong answer fitting most cases\nOn the other hand, most useful data (e. g. file systems) is structured and non-random. With that in mind you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to match it against known patterns like well-known file formats or file system headers. Suitable tools for that are file(1) (general file formats) and blkid(8) (file systems and partition tables).\nAs a bonus, some encryption protocols (e. g. LUKS) attach headers to the encrypted data, which the previously mentioned tools recognise.\n\n*Perform a statistical analysis of the data to see, if it appears random enough, but that's no proof for encryption, only a hint. The data may actually be an unencrypted record of a series of random events.\nHere's a C program, that I wrote a while ago, to do that: https://gist.github.com/davidfoerster/079b6d8c92fb702b89aa\n\n*Try a bunch of encryption protocols and keys and try to decipher it. The problem is, that most common protocols are unable to tell you, if the cipher text was encrypted with a particular protocol and key.\nAs a workaround, use point 1 to see, if the decrypted data fits a known pattern (which it doesn't have to; see point 2. Some encryption protocols (e. g. TrueCrypt) use an encrypted header, so tools can quickly see, if a decryption was successful.\n", "Q: How do I encrypt my /tmp directory?

Both OSes are based on linux, so I expected a painless integration. I found that at what it seemed random intervals of time the ppp tunnel would stop working, although not disconnect. The same errors you mentioned popped up in my debug log as well.\nAfter some debugging I found out that the random intervals were not random but coincided with high traffic being transfered over the tunnel - when I was running backups over the PPTP tunnel.\nWhat I did to solve my problem was disable the CCP compression by adding the following line to my /etc/ppp/options.pptp (The location and name of file may be different in the distro you are running):\nnoccp\n\n\nA: The PPTP server to which you are trying to connect might not support some compression features.\nYou can try to disable (all of them):\n\n\n*\n\n*BSD compression;\n\n*Deflate compression;\n\n*TCP header compression.\n\n\nWith some Windows PPTP servers disabling PPP Echo packets sending may help too.\nYou'll find these options in the configuration window of your VPN connection (VPN tab -> Advanced).\nIf disabling compression features does not solve your problem it might also be linked to the DNS error which we can see in your log excerpt.\nTry to set the DNS manually like this:\nGo to the configuration window of your VPN connection, in IPv4 parameters tab,  and change the method to \"automatic addresses only (VPN)\". Then type the address of the DNS server as well as the search domain. Please ask your network administrator if you do not know these.\nI hope that this will help you to solve your connection problem.\n\nA: I'm experiencing same issue on 13.04\nthis is, I think, related to this bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager-pptp/+bug/290178\nCheck your /var/log/syslog for lines as Protocol-Reject for unsupported protocol\nI have solved it a couple of month ago installing some package from debian unstable\ncheck also this:\nhttps://forum.linode.com/viewtopic.php?p=36204/\nmtu 1400\nand also check out for gre protocol and 1723 port are open.\n\nA: In Kali Linux I tried enabling ONLY mschapv2 authentication, because this was on the router\nI used only 128 bit encryption and I disabled the Deflate data.\nI had disconnections 1 sec after the connection.\nNow I've had it for hours and no problem.\n\nA: When attempting to connect to a windows VPN server from Ubuntu 14.04, I would also see PPTP diconnects and would find this error in my /var/log/syslog, \n\n\"nm-pptp-service-9270 warn[ctrlp_disp:pptp_ctrl.c:956]: Non-zero Async\n  Control Character Maps are not supported!\"\n\nI found my answer on this forum. The advice was: Windows VPN's only work with mppe authentication. To use this, either set the following lines in /etc/ppp/options.pptp \nrefuse-pap\nrefuse-eap\nrefuse-chap\nrefuse-mschap\nrequire-mppe\n\nOr go to the advanced settings of the VPN in the graphical network manager and sure only MSCHAPv2 is checked. uncheck the others (pap, chap, mschap, eap) and also enable mppe.\n\nA: In my case, the cause was that the mtu size of the vpn, was bigger than the path to the host, so you can use traceroute to discover the lower mtu in the path to the host.\nthe command is:\ntraceroute <host> --mtu\nIn my case the lower MTU was 1280, so I used 1200 to make the vpn in the router configuration.\n", "Q: How can I get Kindle for PC working on Ubuntu 12.04?

First when I finished installing ubuntu-server 12.04, I made a snapshot then I updated my server like so\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nI think the guest addition via the ubuntu-repository is buggy. Because after I rebooted I couldn't see in my virtualbox-ubuntu-server-12.04 window. It was just black. I am following this tutorial and it said I need to update my server.\nThat means I will get the virtualbox guest additions from the ubuntu-repository.\nHow can I update upgrade my Ubuntu server 12.04 without installing the guest addition from the Ubuntu-repository?\n\nA: Virtual Box guest additions do not install per default. We do have to manually install them as outlined here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Guest Additions in a VirtualBox VM?\nIn a non-GUI (server) guest we may not need the guest additions if we do not need additional features provided with them (e.g. support for USB2). Then we simply do not install the guest additions that come on an .iso image installed on the host after installing the virtualbox-guest-additions-iso package there with\nuser@host:$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions\n\nWhen having installed the version from the Oracle repository (see this question) the guest additions .iso is installed on the host by default.\nInstalling guest additions is done from an install script on the .iso to compile and  insert the kernel modules provided. Mounting the .iso image can be done from their location on the host, or alternatively by installing the guest additions .iso from the Ubuntu repository with\nuser@guest:$ sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install virtualbox-guest-additions\n\nWe should not install recommends in the guest to avoid installing virtualbox-ose package too.\nNote that the guest-additions version from the repositories may be of an earlier version than Virtual Box when installed from Oracle. This will likely work but it is not recommended.\nAfter having installed the kernel modules guest additions .iso can be removed from the guest OS. To uninstall guest additions from the guest we may remove the kernel modules manually, or run the uninstall.sh script located in /opt/<VirtualBoxAddtions-x.x.xx>/.\n\nA: Wrong command, should be:\n\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso\n\n\nA: You may install the VirtualBox extensions from the Ubuntu or from the Oracle/Virtualbox repositories. \n\n\n*\n\n*You may check: How do I install the VirtualBox version from Oracle to install an Extension Pack?\nNote that the installation of the extensions may require to re-compile the extensions using the DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) or to re-compile the kernel your machine uses. In Ubuntu, you must install dkms before.\n# install dkms if you haven't already\nsudo apt install dkms\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between the five versions of Java on this page for Ubuntu? I want to install Java on my computer so that I can develop programs and I came across this page on Java in the Ubuntu community documentation. It says:\n\nJava is a technology from Oracle (formerly: Sun Microsystems). There\n  are several implementations, of which five will be discussed here:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*OpenJDK: The primary goal of the OpenJDK project is to produce an open-source implementation of the Java SE Platform (6 and 7). This\n  is the default version of Java that Ubuntu uses and is the easiest to\n  install.\n  \n*Oracle (Sun) Java 6: Oracle (Sun) Java 6 is the reference implementation for Java 6.\n  \n*Oracle Java 7: Oracle Java 7 is the reference implementation for Java 7.\n  \n*IBM Java: IBM Java is the preferred Java solution on PowerPC machines. It is a reimplementation with a Just-In-Time Compiler. It is\n  only available from IBM's website.\n  \n*GNU Compiler: A Java compiler made by GNU. Only developers should have to install this.\n  \n\nI read the contents but still am a little confused. Are they all different versions of JDK? If not, then what?\nAnd which one would you prefer?\n\nA: \nAre they all different versions of JDK? If not, then what?\n\nThey are different implementations of Java/development kits for Java (JDK). Java is a standard platform, and all of these implement that platform in their own way. Of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenJDK and GNU Compiler are the only ones that are open source. I usually prefer them -- the ease of installation (apt-get or Software Center) is a big factor.\n\n*\n\n*OpenJDK in particular is derived mostly from the \"official\" Java source code that Oracle/Sun open sourced; it is backed by Oracle.\n\n\n*Oracle Java 6 and 7 are \"the\" Java, if you will, from the company that invented Java (that was Sun, but Oracle bought them a while back). That's why they are called reference implementations. You may want to use them if you are using Oracle JDK on another platform too, or if OpenJDK is giving you problems.\n\n*\n\n*The 6 and 7 refer to versions of the language/platform. 7 is newer and has more features, but has been tested less; 6 is extremely mature and stable. I'd prefer 6 if you are just starting out.\n\n\n*Contrary to the wiki, IBM makes JDKs/JREs for all platforms, although theirs might be the only one for the PowerPC.\n\n\n\nIf you are starting out in programming, almost any of these will be a good fit. Go for OpenJDK just because its easy to install.\nThe only experience I have in differentiating these is compiling in a low-resource environment (128-192MB RAM - a VPS); I found Oracle Java 6 JDK worked best for one program (i.e succeeded) and IBM Java 6 JDK for another...\n\nA: Java Language and Runtime Environment is a specification. All this packages are different implementations of the same specification. \nAnd read more here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1977238/why-should-i-use-the-oracle-jdk-over-the-openjdk-or-vice-versa\nUsually you just should use openJDK as it works just as fine as Oracles JDK but is open source, so you don't have any issues with licences. More info at http://openjdk.java.net/\n\nA: It explains what each one is on the page but essentially they are all Orcale's java just developed by different groups. \n\n\n*\n\n*OpenJDK is the open source development of Oracles Java edition.\n\n*Java 6 and 7 are just versions of Oracles Java standard edition. & is the most up to date and released last year in June or July I think.\n\n*The IBM version was mainly used for PowerPCs as its states probably wont matter much  to you unless you have a PowerPC processor.\n\n*The GNU compiler is for developers that are coding in Java. Its just a compiler for java. If you don't know what    this one is then you probably don't need it unless you are wanting to learn about Java development.\n\n\nI use OpenJDK because it works better with Minecraft. No other reason ha. \nBill  \n\nA: As far as I know,openJDK is almost the same as Sun JDK, the main difference is that it is open source.You cannot use a IBM JDK if you are an PC user since it is restricted on PowerPC.The gcj is not considered a good choice for me since it seems still immature.\n\nA: This will probably anger many of the more FLOSS folks but here's my short answer.  \nOracle acquired Sun, Oracle (Sun) Java 6 is just the older version of Oracle Java 7.  That being said.. Unless you have a really good reason not to use Oracle's version.  Everything else is an attempt to replicate that Oracle has done and none of them are as good.  \nAs far as break down on the quality.\nGNU Java is the worst attempt of the JVM I've ever seen.. unless you enjoy frequent crashes.. don't use it.\nIBM Java -- never used it honestly, so no opinion\nOpenJDK -- if you're going to use an open source implementation of the JVM I would use OpenJDK and use the 7.x version.\n\nA: FWIW, I've had fewer problems with Oracle/Sun Java than any other version. OpenJDK works most of the time. I've never gotten GNU Java to work. IBM Java seems good, but I don't have much experience with it.\nWebUpd8te has a PPA that makes installation via apt-get easy.

I want to update the BIOS on Toshiba QOSMIO-G30. The exe file that I downloaded from the manufacturer web site is supposed to be Operating System independent! Yet using Wine I could not execute the file to FLASH System BIOS. Is there any way to update the BIOS in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Flashing using only GNU/Linux\n(No floppy disks, No CDs, No DOS, No FreeDOS, No Win*)\nExplanation\nUsually there are two files:\n\n*\n\n*a binary file which includes all the data (firmware) which is going to be transferred to the motherboard's rom chip,\n\n\n*a binary file which is an executable utility and is used to make the actual transfer of the firmware to the motherboard, plus some checks.\nManufacturers may combine these two binaries into one self extracted compressed executable file (.exe which is like a .zip file).\nIn this case a GNU/linux user can unzip the .exe file and extract the firmware file. Then using the flashrom utility can flash the new firmware to the motherboard.\nI have tested this procedure using a Gigabyte GA-Z68MA-D2H-B3 (rev. 1.3) and an .exe file which included F10 firmware revision.\nThe procedure\nTo make a backup of the old firmware:\nflashrom -p internal -r backup.rom -o backuplog.txt\n\nTo make the writing of the new firmware, replace Z8MAD2H3.F10 with your new firmware:\nflashrom -p internal -w Z8MAD2H3.F10 -o writelog.txt\n\nTo revert from an unsuccessful writing, if you completed the backup at the first step:\nflashrom -p internal -w backup.rom -o restorelog.txt\n\n\nA: That's not going to work.\nDepending on the tool provided by Toshiba, you must either:\n\n\n*\n\n*run the exe file on a real Windows\n\n*create a DOS boot disk\n\n\nIf Toshiba is providing an exe file for the second option, you can try creating a FreeDOS image to run the file. I found a description for Gentoo how to do that.\n\nA: This site explains how to go about doing a BIOS update under Linux.\nQuoted from the same site:\n\nSo you've finally made the move to a Windows-free computer, you're\n  enjoying your brand new Linux OS, no Trojans/viruses, no slowdown,\n  everything is perfect. Suddenly, you need to update the BIOS on your\n  motherboard to support some new piece of hardware, but typically the\n  motherboard vendor is offering only DOS based BIOS flash utilities.\n  You panic! Fortunately, this problem is easy to solve...\nBelow are the steps to follow:\nStep 1: Download FreeDOS boot disk floppy image\nStep 2: Copy your BIOS flash utility and new BIOS image to the mounted\n  floppy disk image\nStep 3: Burn a bootable CD which will emulate floppy device for use\nStep 4: Reboot, flash, reboot, enjoy your new BIOS\n\nSource: linuxinsight.com\n\nA: I would highly recommend not flashing a BIOS with an .exe using Wine.  Flashing a BIOS can potentially turn your computer into a large paperweight if something goes wrong.\nSome manufacturers (I know Dell does for example) have alternative BIOS upgrade methods for Linux.\nHowever if Toshiba does not offer any Linux compatible options, your best bet is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine if you really need to do the update.  If you aren't having any problems with the BIOS currently and don't require any new features from it you can probably safely ignore the update.\n\n*If you do require the update, either create a DOS boot disk (Mitch's answer links to a good how-to for doing this), install DOS/freeDOS etc. onto a new partition, or -gulp- install Windows.  If you have an extra old hard drive around you could also install this hard drive, put windows on it, flash the BIOS and then switch back to your hard drive with Ubuntu on it.\n\n\nA: There is no such thing like OS-independent binary executables. As \"exe file\" probably means \"a file whose name ends in .EXE\", that's most likely either a Windows Portable Executable or an MS-DOS executable.\nBIOS upgrade are really supposed to be something low-level you can do with a simple system, such as MS-DOS or FreeDOS.\nSo the first step here is to check whether the executable is an MS-DOS executable or a Windows executable. If it is a windows executable and it does not run under Wine, try to see if it is somehow extractable using an archiving tool (sometimes unzip may be able to help here), so you get the flash image and maybe MS-DOS flash tools (it would not be the first time MS-DOS tools are packaged inside a windows-only installer).\nWith no flash tools, there are generic flashers like Uniflash that are worth a try. If you want to run it and it is windows only, a good choice is probably to get a Windows Preinstallation Environment live CD, which has the basic system and will be able to run the flash tool, but unfortunately that requires a Windows license.\nIf you're lucky and you get a set of MS-DOS tools, just grab some FreeDOS live CD or floppy image and boot into FreeDOS to use the tools (although you will need to have the tools in a separate floppy/pen/CD). If you are even luckier, you may get a ready-to-boot disk image (as many people pack floppy images inside floppy image writers, that's possible, too).\n\nA: If you don't have a Win-10 copy, and if you don't want to download a 5 Gb tryout version and install it, a Win-10 based rescue disk will do it. For example, this one allowed me to run the windows .exe file provided by HP. I used directly the \"update the installed BIOS\".\nSimplier than the Free DOS solution, in my opinion.\n\nA: Many modern laptops and system don't actually use the EXE files directly to update the BIOS, but instead ask that you write the file to a USB flash stick and boot into the BIOS with that inserted.\n\nA: Disconnect your Ubuntu system drive, connect an old spare or used drive, install Windows on it, and do the BIOS update (if, as Pilot6 explains, if you absolutely, positively, have to update the BIOS). Then, disconnect the old drive, put your Ubuntu OS drive back on, and you're ready to go, secure in the knowledge that Windows did not corrupt Linux (which happens often, sadly).\n", "Q: Correct place to set $BIBINPUTS environment variable If I set the $BIBINPUTS environment varibale in my .zshrc, it is recognized by emacs-reftex (via emacsclient), if I start emacs from my zsh commandline. \nHowever if I start using the menubar or gmrun it doesn't knot this variable.

I don't have any issues with shutdown or freezing with my Ubuntu 12.04, now running for over a month. I did have this issue on the 10.04 LTS version but none here. It's most likely a software that prevents Ubuntu to shutdown as the program could still be processing. It may see that nothing is running to you but in the backend there are programs running. One of these programs (possibly a third party application) could be causing this issue. There are several other reasons why this could happen, apart from just the program interference.

Is there an easier way other than official installation instructions? \n\nA: Using the Ubuntu OpenStack Installer\nAs the title suggests this little gem is an Openstack installer tailored specifically to get you from zero to hero in just a short amount of time.\nThere are a few options available today for deploying an Openstack cloud. For instance, juju-deployer with an Openstack specific bundle or that other thing called devstack. A lot of people may not have 10 systems laying around to utilize juju-deployer or you may be wanting to demonstrate to the power of Ubuntu.\nThe Ubuntu OpenStack Installer was created for these reasons. \nRequirements\n\n\n*\n\n*Decent machine, tested on a machine with 8 cores, 12G ram, and 100G HDD.\n\n*Ubuntu Trusty 14.04\n\n*Juju 1.18.3+ (includes support for lxc fast cloning for multiple providers)\n\n*About 30 minutes of your time.\n\n\nFirst\nAdd the ppa and install the software:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:cloud-installer/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openstack\n\nSecond\nRun it.\nsudo openstack-install\n\n\nInstall selection\nThird\nYou're presented with 3 options, a Single Install, Multi Install, and Landscape. Select Single Install.\nPost\nThe installer will go through its little routine of installing necessary packages and setting up configuration. Once this is complete you'll be dropped into a status screen which will then begin the magical journey of getting you setup with a fully functioning OpenStack cloud.\nYep, to elaborate a bit I'll explain what's happening:\nThe entire stack is running off a single machine. Juju is heavily utilized for its ability to deploy services, setup relations, and configure those services. Similar to what juju-deployer does. What juju-deployer doesn't do is automatically sync boot images via simplestreams or automatically configure neutron to have all deployed instances within nova-compute available on the same network as the host machine all while using a single network card. We even throw in juju-gui for good measure!\nThe experience we are trying to achieve is that any one person can sit down at a machine and have a complete end to end working OpenStack environment. Here's a screenshot of the nifty console ui:\n\nVerify\nVerifying your cloud is easy, just go through the process of deploying an instance via Horizon (OpenStack Dashboard, displayed at the bottom of the status screen), associating a floating IP (already created for you just need to select one) and ssh into the newly created instance to deploy your software stack. Depending on bandwidth some images may not be immediately available and may require you to wait a little longer.\nWhat about those other install options?\nWell, as I stated before we have a lot of cool technologies out there like MAAS. That is what the Multi Install is for. The cool thing about this is you install it the same way you would a Single Install. Fast-forward past the package installing and to the status screen you'll be presented with a dialog stating to PXE boot a machine to act as the controller. Our installer tries to do everything for you but some things are left up to you. In this case you'd commission a machine in the MAAS environment and get it into a ready state. From there the Installer will pick up that machine and continue on its merry way as it did during the single installation.\nOne thing to note is you'll want to have a few machines whether it be bare metal or virtual registered in MAAS to make use of all the installer has to offer. I was able to get a full cloud deployed on 3 machines, 1 bare metal (the host machine running maas), 2 virtual machines registered in MAAS. Keep in mind there were no additional network devices added as the installer can configure neutron on a single NIC\nIf you need swift storage for your glance images hit (F6) in the status screen and select Swift storage. This will deploy the necessary bits for swift-storage to be integrated into your Openstack cloud. Swift storage requires at least 3 nodes (in the single install this would be 3 VMs) so make sure you've got the hardware for this. Otherwise, for developing/toying around with Openstack leaving the defaults works just as good.\n\nAdd swift storage\nWant to deploy additional instances on your compute nodes? Add additional machines to your MAAS environment or if running on a single machine and you have the hardware add a few more nova-compute nodes (via F6 in the status screen) to allow for more instances to be deployed within Openstack.\nThis is just an intro into the installer more documentation can be found @ ReadTheDocs. The project is hosted @ GitHub and we definitely encourage you to star it, fork it, file issues, and contribute back to make this a truly enjoyable experience.

The chkrootkit package's /etc/cron.daily/chkrootkit script has a workaround for this which tries to replaces the PID with a static string.\nHowever, the workaround for the false positive doesn't work.  This is because on Debian, the binaries from these packages used to end with a version number, e.g. /sbin/dhclient3.  But the chkrootkit package maintainers never updated /etc/cron.daily/chkrootkit to work with version 4 series of the isc-dhcp-client and isc-dhcp-server packages, whose files don't have the version number.\nTo fix this issue, make a backup copy of /etc/cron.daily/chkrootkit then edit it and change...\nsed -r -e 's,eth(0|1)(:[0-9])?: PACKET SNIFFER\\((/sbin/dhclient3|/usr/sbin/dhcpd3)\\[[0-9]+\\]\\),eth\\[0|1\\]: PACKET SNIFFER\\([dhclient3|dhcpd3]{PID}\\),' \\\n\n...to...\nsed -r -e 's,eth(0|1)(:[0-9])?: PACKET SNIFFER\\((/sbin/dhclient|/usr/sbin/dhcpd)\\[[0-9]+\\]\\),eth\\[0|1\\]: PACKET SNIFFER\\([dhclient|dhcpd]{PID}\\),' \\\n\nBe careful to leave the backslash at the end of the line.\n\nA: Dhclient is the standard \" Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Client\" for Ubuntu that is needed for when you have not a fixed IP but still want to be reachable from the Internet.\nIn case you are worried you should check your dhclient.conf for unwanted entries.\n", "Q: How to package a single text file into a .deb? I'm trying to a make a simple .deb package, which would basically edit a config of another package I listed as a dependency. \nI added the required manipulations to the postinstall file.\nThe problem is I can't find a way to package an example config, which should be copied and edited from the postinstall script.\nAt the moment I just have a folder with the sample config, of which I'm creating a tar.gz and orig.tar.gz, then dh_make in that folder, edit the generated files and run debuild. However if I open the resulting .deb file with an archive manager, I can see that the sample file was not included at all.\n\nA: For your use case you would not use a new package to modify your configuration.  Rather, you should rebuild the package that you are modifying with a modified default config (via a patch).  Then, you would upload that package to a PPA or similar repository system for easy installation.\nPackaging a single file into a .deb just to change a different .deb's config file is not advised given that if that other .deb is modified and you ahve an explicit version in your debian/control, and the new version is too new, your system will reject the config-changing .deb.\nPlease comment on this answer with why you specifically want a .deb to do the conf changes, and I can elaborate on how you'd go about doing this, if at all.\n\n\nWell, first is that I imagined that making such a .deb would be a no-brainer, secondly I don't expect the config to change a lot, and I think that if I repackage another package I will need to update my package as soon as an update arrives to the original one (?). I'd greatly appreciate your help, the package I'm trying to change the config of is collectd, and I just need to replace /etc/collectd/collectd.conf in the postinstall script – Fluffy\n\nMaking a .deb is not a no-brainer, you actually need substantial understanding of how packaging works among other things.  You will have to update your package once an update arrives from the original one, but that can be partially decided based upon changelogs, including but not limited to what package currently exists in Ubuntu, and what is fixed in the differing version.  But once you have the patch, you can apply it just as easily in the new version as it is to apply it to the old version, hence why I mentioned that.\n\n\nDo I need to download the current .deb, unpack and edit it, or do I have to deal with the original source code? – Fluffy\n\nThis question is unanswerable in its current form, so let me elaborate on other questions i've seen:\n\nWhat is a Source Package?\n\nA source package is a package in which the binary installer packages (.debs) are built from.  They contain the entire source code of a program, but with all applicable patches and Debian package information in them.\n\nDoes editing a source package mean i'm editing the source code of the program?\n\nNot necessarily.  The source code of the program is indeed what the package is built from, but unless you're changing that code, you could modify a package without even touching the code.  Depending of course, on what you are trying to do.\nSo to explain simply, regardless of whichever you do here you'll need to edit either the source code of the program downloaded upstream, or the source code contained within the package.  So the \"Original Source Code\" is going to be worked with regardless.  The postinst scripts and other installation-related scripts though are stored in debian/* within the package, and are not part of the source code.\n\nPatches to packages are touched upon in the packaging guide: http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/patches-to-packages.html\nThe complete Ubuntu Packaging Guide is here: http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/\n\nAfter recieving additional information via email, the configuration is being updated for a specific package in order to include some type of restricted API that has a single-use key.\nMy method statement of using a PPA would not be recommended in this case given that API keys are usually specific to individual configurations, and such modified configurations should not be publicized, so that others don't try to hijack those configs.\n\nA: If you are packaging this for Ubuntu, the the best place for finding out information on how to do get it done, of course Ubuntu.

Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) uses the 3.2 kernel. To allow the VMWare modules to successfully build on it, you need to patch (fix) the modules' source code. You can find the patch Here \nFollow the instructions carefully, and you should be OK.\n", "Q: Which kind of installation files should you prefer - .deb or tarball files? And why? I have just starting Ubuntu as my primary OS and everytime I have to install something I generally try to find .deb files as that seems convenient, but someone on another forum told me I should always use tarball files.\nSo can you tell me what would be the ideal recommendation and why?\n\nA: Possible duplicate\nBut on a personal note:\nUsing .deb lets you keep track of the install. (e.g. So you can uninstall or upgrade later).  Installing from source (.tar.gz or otherwise) puts you in charge of what and where to install.  You can have multiple versions installed at various locations, and they are hard for me to uninstall.  Personally I prefer to .deb files.\n\nA: You should not normally find and randomly install any Debian package from the Internet. Use apt-get to add/remove packages and apt-cache for querying.\n\nA: Always look for software packages in official repositories. They are well tested for stability and performance.  Installing packages using .deb files is advisable, as it'll take care of dependencies and as answered above solves a lot of maintenance issues.  If you want to install using tarballs, then make sure that package dependencies are met.\n\nA: I use deb files much more often than tarball files mainly because installing the item is much more simple with deb files than having to compile and other steps for tarball. I don't think there is any difference between the two as to what they give you, you just receive it in a different way.\n", "Q: Ubuntu can't download files during update to 12.04 (Failed to fetch) I have a fail during upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 (Failed to fetch)\nI've been trying to update ubuntu from 11.10 to 12.04 for a while (from Update manager).

My college on MAC have no problems to get this files manualy.\nI've never played with iptables or anything else on my machine.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: Issue was out of my PC. Today I've decided to switch to another ethernet socket, and magic happened: all broken URLs suddenly fixed (why did not I do this later...). Seems to be the problem in switch. Question is closed.\n\nA: You can try downloading the ISO installation image for Ubuntu 12.04 and then burning it to a CD or USB. Booting off that, just choose the upgrade option and it should upgrade your system in place, which would bypass the need to download those packages (since they're inside the ISO).\nSorry but I can't really help on why you're getting those Connection Broken messages. If all other download traffic works, then I would look and see if your office is using some tricky proxy or firewall that might cause problems.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu V12 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I upgrade from 10.04 or 11.10 to 12.04? \n\nAlready run Ubuntu V10 but won't automatically upgrade.\nCan I just install V12 'over the top' or do I have to save all files and settings etc to disc first?\n\nA: http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-10.04-lucid-lynx-to-10.10-maverick-meerkat-desktop-and-server \ngo to this link and it will show you the steps.\nonce you have updated it once keep doing it until you reach ubuntu 12.\nyou have to do this because all the other has bug fixes and other secuirty patches.\nthis method is good if you want to keep all your data and you wont lose anything and you will still have your software you wont lose anything.\n", "Q: Delete a user and all files owned by this user I have used deluser without the parameter --remove-all-files:\n$ deluser 'user'\n\nIs there a way other than rm -r /home/user to remove all files owned by a user now (since I have already executed deluser)?\n\nA: Another option would be to re-add the user with adduser, specifying the old UID, and then run deluser again, this time with the --remove-all-files flag.\nSuppose, for instance, that the user had username alice and UID 1001:\nsudo adduser --uid 1001 alice\nsudo deluser --remove-all-files alice\n\nA: gnu find has the options -nouser and -nogroup, look it up in man find. With these options you can find all files in your filesystem(s) that have no corresponding user in /etc/passwd. If you have not created a new user with the old uids of your deleted users, this is a possibility to find these orphaned files.\nHowever, you might find more files - not only those who belonged to your deleted one.\n\nA: You will have to manually find files, which probably was what deluser would do.\nPlease note --remove-all-files is not the same as rm -r /home/user. The latter only removes the homedir (which may include files not owned by that user, although not usual), the former removes all files owned by that user from the system. At least if the manpage is to be trusted.\nGNU find has a -user test, so you can do find / -user xxx to find all files owned by user xxx. xxx would be the user name, and can (and in this case will have to, as the user no longer exists) be the user's numeric ID. find also has a -delete option, so \nfind / -user xxx -delete\n\nShould do it, although I've not tested the command with all the options at the same time.\nEDIT: Numeric ID: The reason why I said you have to use a numeric ID is because, as you already deleted the user, his entry in /etc/passwd was deleted (it had, along with other stuff, the user ID, along with his username).\nSo, if you didn't remove his homedir, one of the easiest ways is to just query for the ID of the owner of that homedir:\nstat -c %u /home/user/\n\n(stat is a tool to read filesystem data. -c %u tells stat how to write its output, here I'm asking it to simply output the user ID)\nIf you like one-liners, you can even chain both commands:\nfind / -user $(stat -c %u /home/user/) -delete\n\n(Of course you may prefer to run it first with no -delete to make sure there's nothing you want to keep, and to catch any mistake you've made writing the rest of the command.

PPA's are normally disabled when you upgrade, and must be re-enabled manually. I upgraded to 12.04 about a month ago and I just noticed that while my other PPAs had all been disabled, the Google PPAs were not disabled.  Why is this?\n\nA: (Credit to Jorge Castro for this answer)\nThe Google packages install a cron job in /etc/cron.daily/ for custumizing the repository configuration and reenabling the source after a release upgrade.\nEach Google package will put its own script (or a link to a script) here.  For example: google-musicmanager, google-chrome or google-talkplugin (the latter being a symlink to a script at /opt/google/talkplugin/cron/google-talkplugin).\nHere is the description from the google-talkplugin script:\n# This script is part of the google-talkplugin package.\n#\n# It creates the repository configuration file for package updates, and it\n# monitors that config to see if it has been disabled by the overly aggressive\n# distro upgrade process (e.g.  intrepid -> jaunty). When this situation is\n# detected, the respository will be re-enabled. If the respository is disabled\n# for any other reason, this won't re-enable it.\n#\n# This functionality can be controlled by creating the $DEFAULTS_FILE and\n# setting \"repo_add_once\" and/or \"repo_reenable_on_distupgrade\" to \"true\" or\n# \"false\" as desired. An empty $DEFAULTS_FILE is the same as setting both values\n# to \"false\".\n\nThe script will:\n\n\n*\n\n*# Install the repository signing key\n\n*# Update the Google repository if it's not set correctly.\n\n*# Add the Google repository to the apt sources.\n\n*# Remove our custom sources list file.\nand\n\n*# Detect if the repo config was disabled by distro upgrade and enable if necessary.\nHere is the portion of the script that detects and reenables the repo config after a release upgrade.\nhandle_distro_upgrade() {\n  if [ ! \"$REPOCONFIG\" ]; then\n    return 0\n  fi\n\n  find_apt_sources\n  SOURCELIST=\"$APT_SOURCESDIR/google-talkplugin.list\"\n  if [ -r \"$SOURCELIST\" ]; then\n    REPOLINE=$(grep -E \"^[[:space:]]*#[[:space:]]*$REPOCONFIG[[:space:]]*# disabled on upgrade to .*\" \"$SOURCELIST\")\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n      sed -i -e \"s,^[[:space:]]*#[[:space:]]*\\($REPOCONFIG\\)[[:space:]]*# disabled on upgrade to .*,\\1,\" \\\n        \"$SOURCELIST\"\n      LOGGER=$(which logger 2> /dev/null)\n      if [ \"$LOGGER\" ]; then\n        \"$LOGGER\" -t \"$0\" \"Reverted repository modification: $REPOLINE.\"\n      fi\n    fi\n  fi\n}\n\nAnd here is the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-talkplugin.list file that is created by the script.\n### THIS FILE IS AUTOMATICALLY CONFIGURED ###\n# You may comment out this entry, but any other modifications may be lost.\ndeb http://dl.google.com/linux/talkplugin/deb/ stable main\n\n", "Q: pulseaudio does not start after logout and login again I am using Ubuntu 12.04.

But there is no secondary display entry. okay..no luck.\nSecond Try: Starting the Nvidia-settings manager and try to configure the displays here.

My system crashed, after reinstalling Nvidia drivers(with Maverick Meercat.) -Could not resolve problem, and have done a clean installation of Ubuntu 9.10. Now I would like to upgrade to 12.04. I had so many problems with Unity Desktop, following installation of Natty Narwhal that I gave up, and chose to upgrade to Maverick Meercat (10.10.) How should I proceed?\n\nA: If you want to upgrade from Maverick to Precise, you have to update the whole system three times. That means, three huge package downloads, three installations, three cleanings, three reboots, and so on. AFAIK there is no (safe) way to upgrade by more than one version at time. If I were you, given that you have a clean installation and then you didn't modify too much, I'll directly install Ubuntu 12.04 (deleting the old partition first) where there was the old installation.\nThe (really) unsafe way to upgrade the system by more than one version is:\n\n\n*\n\n*vi /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n*Replace each line e.g. deb http://it.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick universe with its corresponding e.g. deb http://it.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe\n\n*aptitude update\n\n*aptitude full-upgrade\nYou must be very expert and very lucky for this process to complete without throwing away the installation. Don't try this at home.\n\nA: If you are running from a clean install of 9.10 and have no settings to be lost it might be faster/easier to just download an .iso for 12.04 and install it from a liveCD or liveUSB.\nI've generally always found clean installs better than upgrades when I don't have custom settings/applications to be lost.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server ISO for VMware Player Where can I find an Ubuntu Server ISO to use (convert to a VM) in VMware Player?\n\nA: From Ubuntu's website, of course. :-) You don't need a special VMWare only ISO.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/server\n\nA: You can get the Ubuntu server virtual images from VMware's repository for images here:\n\n\n*\n\n*VMware virtual appliance marketplace\nYou can search for the image you want in the search box to the left.

Unfortunately, for some reason (or reasons), I just can't make it work.\nNote that I am attempting a fresh install of 64-bit v12.04 onto a new 3TB hard disk, not an upgrade of the 1TB hard disk that contains my working 64-bit v10.04 installation.\nTo perform the attempted install of v12.04, I unplug the SATA cable from the 1TB drive and plug it into the 3TB drive (to avoid risking damage to my working v10.04 installation).\nI downloaded the Ubuntu 64-bit v12.04 install DVD ISO file (~1.6 GB) from the Ubuntu releases webpage and burned it onto a DVD.  I have downloaded the DVD ISO file 3 times and burned 3 of these installation DVDs (twice with v10.04 and once with my winxp64 system), but none of them work.  I run the \"check disk\" on the DVDs at the beginning of the installation process to assure the DVD is valid.\nWhen installation completes and the system boots the 3TB drive, it reports \"unknown filesystem\".  After installation on the 250GB drives, the system boots up fine.\nDuring every install I plug the same SATA cable (sda) into only one disk drive (the 3TB or one of the 250GB drives) and leave the other disk drives unconnected (for simplicity).\nIt is my understanding that 64-bit Ubuntu (and 64-bit linux in general) has no problem with 3TB disk drives. In the BIOS I have tried having EFI set to \"enabled\" and \"auto\" with no apparent difference (no success).  I never bothered setting the BIOS to \"non-EFI\".\nI have tried partitioning the drive in a few ways to see if that makes a difference, but so far it has not mattered. Typically I manually create partitions something like this:\n8GB  /boot  ext4\n8GB  swap\n3TB  /      ext4\n\nBut I've also tried the following, just in case it matters:\n  8GB  boot   efi\n  8GB  swap\n  8GB  /boot  ext4\n  3TB  /      ext4\n\nNote:  In the partition dialog I specify bootup on the same drive I am partitioning and installing Ubuntu v12.04 onto.  It is a VERY DANGEROUS FACT that the default for this always comes up with the wrong drive (some other drive, generally the external drive).  Unless I'm stupid or misunderstanding something, this is very wrong and very dangerous default behavior.\nNote:  If I connect the SATA cable to the 1TB drive that has been my ubuntu 64-bit v10.04 system drive for the past 2 years, it boots up and runs fine.\nI guess there must be a log file somewhere, and maybe it gives some hints as to what the problem is. I should be able to boot off the 1TB drive with the 3TB drive connected as a secondary (non-boot) drive and get the log file, assuming there is one and someone tells me the name (and where to find it if the name is very generic).\nAfter installation on the 3TB drive completes and the system reboots, the following prints out on a black screen:\nLoading Operating System ...\nBoot from CD/DVD :\nBoot from CD/DVD :\nerror: unknown filesystem\ngrub rescue>\n\nNote:  I have two DVD burners in the system, hence the duplicate line above.\nNote:  I install and boot 64-bit Ubuntu v12.04 on both of my 250GB in this same system, but still cannot make the 3TB drive boot.\nSigh.

Ignore that drive for now, get things working on the 250GB drive first, then try the 3TB drive.\nBoot into a working OS, connect and mount the 250GB drive, and look at the logs in /var/log from the mounted drive. That's where the other logs are at in most flavors of Ubuntu, so the installation logs should be there, too.\n\nA: I`m going to go out on a limb here.\nThere is a GUID partition table (GPT) that needs to be implemented, for the master boot record. Current master boot record partitions are limited to 2.1TB, so a new GPT partition table would also need to be used to see beyond this.\nOf course, this is all fine if you’re using a 3TB drive as a secondary disk, but there are more problems to overcome if you want to use that 3TB drive to boot your OS. Unfortunately, the master boot record is a key part of the standard BIOS setup that motherboards have used for decades.  \nNow that being said,  Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10 have a serious bug that causes it to erase any existing ESP, thus wiping out any existing boot loaders or other files installed there.  Thankfully, this bug has been fixed in Ubuntu 12.04.  \nI would recommend that you take a look At this site for better understanding about UEFI booting. \nLet me know if that works for you.\n\nA: Boot the DVD as Live Ubuntu,the easiest tool i know to do this is GParted.\nAt the Gparted search for your 3 TB drive,and make new partition  table \"Create New Partition Table\",when a new window appear asking for the partition table type,click the ms-dos and choose gpt.OK..... Apply.... done.... then install your 64-bit Ubuntu.\neasy isn't it ? :)\n\nA: I guess there is a problem on grub so you can try to handle it with using boot-repair program which is have a great comminity page1. Open your pc via any ubuntu live cd and install that program after that follow the instructions from comminity page.\n", "Q: HP Pavilion g6 1190sm laptop has overheat/hibernation/graphics issues Every time I reboot or shutdown my laptop, while the laptop is booting again I get a screen (before loading the OS) that HP discovered overheating and system went into hibernation.

For whatever reason, I never have good luck with locate though.\nlocate uses database of files and directories made by updatedb. So if you have downloaded a new file there is more chance that your updatedb has not updated the database of files and directories. You can use sudo updatedb before using locate utility program.\nupdatedb generally runs once a day by itself on linux systems.\n\nA: This should simplify the locating of file:\nThis would give you the full path to the file\ntree -f  / | grep postgis-2.0.0\n\nTree lists the contents of directories in a tree-like format. the -f tells tree to give the full path to the file. since we have no idea of its location or parent location, good to search from the filesystem root / recursively downwards.\nWe then send the output to grep to highlight our word, postgis-2.0.0 \n\nA: Try find ~/ -type f -name \"postgis-2.0.0\" instead.\nUsing . will only search the current directory.  ~/ will search your entire home directory (likely where you downloaded it to).  If you used wget as root, its possible it could be somewhere else so you could use / to search the whole filesystem.\nGoodluck\n\nA: The other answers are good, but I find omitting Permission denied statements gives me clearer answers (omits stderrs due to not running sudo):\nfind / -type f -iname \"*postgis-2.0.0*\" 2>/dev/null\n\nwhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*/ can be replaced with the directory you want to start your search from\n\n*f can be replaced with d if you're searching for a directory instead of a file\n\n*-iname can be replaced with -name if you want the search to be case sensitive\n\n*the *s in the search term can be omitted if you don't want the wildcards in the search\n\n\nAn alternative is:\nfind / -type f 2>/dev/null | grep \"postgis-2.0.0\"\n\nThis way returns results if the search-term matches anywhere in the complete file path, e.g. /home/postgis-2.0.0/docs/Readme.txt\n\nA: find is one of the most useful Linux/Unix tools.\nTry find . -type d | grep DIRNAME\n\nA: Try find . -name \"*file_name*\"\n\n\n*\n\n*where you can change '.'(look into the Current Directory) to '/'(look into the entire system) or '~/'(look into the Home Directory).\n\n*where you can change \"-name\" to \"-iname\" if you want no case sensitive.\n\n*where you can change \"file_name\"(a file that can start and end with whatever it is) to the exactly name of the file.\n\nA: $ find . -type f | grep IMG_20171225_*\nGives\n./03-05--2018/IMG_20171225_200513.jpg\nThe DOT after the command find is to state a starting point,\nHence - the current folder,\n\"piped\" (=filtered) through the name filter IMG_20171225_*\n\nA: While find command is simplest way to recursively traverse the directory tree, there are other ways and in particular the two scripting languages that come with Ubuntu by default already have the ability to do so.\nbash\nbash  has a very nice globstar shell option, which allows for recursive traversal of the directory tree. All we need to do is test for whether item in the ./**/* expansion is a file and whether it contains the desired text:\nbash-4.3$ for f in ./**/* ;do [ -f \"$f\" ] && [[ \"$f\" =~ \"postgis-2.0.0\" ]] && echo \"$f\"; done \n./testdir/texts/postgis-2.0.0\n\nPerl\nPerl has Find module, which allows to perform recursive traversal of directory tree, and via subroutine perform specific action on them. With a small script, you can traverse directory tree, push files that contain the desired string into array, and then print it like so:\n#!/usr/bin/env perl\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nuse File::Find;\n\nmy @wanted_files;\nfind(\n     sub{ \n         -f $_ && $_ =~ $ARGV[0]  \n               && push @wanted_files,$File::Find::name\n     }, \".\"\n);\n\nforeach(@wanted_files){\n    print \"$_\\n\"\n}\n\nAnd how it works: \n$ ./find_file.pl  \"postgis-2.0.0\"                                                       \n./testdir/texts/postgis-2.0.0\n\nPython\nPython is another scripting language that is used very widely in Ubuntu world. In particular, it has os.walk() module which allows us to perform the same action as above - traverse directory tree and obtain list of files that contain desired string.\nAs one-liner this can be done as so:\n$ python -c 'import os;print([os.path.join(r,i) for r,s,f in os.walk(\".\") for i in f if \"postgis-2.0.0\" in i])'                                                                         \n['./testdir/texts/postgis-2.0.0']\n\nFull script would look like so:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport os;\n\nfor r,s,f in os.walk(\".\"):\n    for i in f:\n        if \"postgis-2.0.0\" in i:\n            print(os.path.join(r,i))\n\n", "Q: Pen cursor in Xournal I use Xournal to give lectures and do various other tasks.

On my Ubuntu 11.10 machines running byobu 4.37 I can use the key combination Ctrl+← / Ctrl+→ to jump a word at a time in the terminal. However, on my Ubuntu 12.04 machines with byobu 5.17 this no longer works.\nI've read that byobu has remapped those key combinations to resize splits, and now Alt+← and Alt+→ have the desired effect. However, I'm unable to find where Alt+← and Alt+→ are mapped, in order to remap Ctrl+← and Ctrl+→. If I unmap the key bindings for Ctrl+← and Ctrl+→, then the cursor moves only 1 character at a time, not 1 word at a time.\n\nA: One solution was to switch the backend to screen. However, I had recurring issues with ctrl-right when I did that. To do that change ~/.byobu/backend to BYOBU_BACKEND=screen.\nI subsequently found a much better solution using tmux from this bug. Create ~/.byobu/.tmux.conf with this value:\nset-window-option -g xterm-keys on\n\nThen ~/.byobu/keybindings.tmux with:\nunbind-key -n C-Left\nunbind-key -n C-Right\n\nNow ctrl-left and ctrl-right jump one word at a time in tmux.\n\nA: In my ~/.zshrc\nbindkey '^[[1;5D' backward-word\nbindkey '^[[1;5C' forward-word\n\n... And now ctrl+left / right jump words in byobu / tmux.\n\nA: The reason for the change is because now Byobu is using tmux as the backend, instead of screen. \nCTRL-Left & CTRL-Right are used in tmux for navigating panes, so we have to tell tmux not to do this! Just edit your ~/.byobu/keybindings.tmux and add the following lines to the end:\nunbind-key -n C-Left\nunbind-key -n C-Right\n\nJust log out/back in and you should see the change.\n*Note, this will only work for xterm, not for the actual ttys.

You could edit your /etc/init/failsafe.conf file and comment-out the two sleep of 40 and 59 seconds.

I was planning to buy Acer Aspire One D270 within a few days and as everybody installs linux on their netbook I was also planning to do that.\nNow, my question is how is Acer's hardware compatibility with linux and specifically in respect to the new Acer Aspire One D270.\nHas anybody tried installing linux on these new netbooks. It will be a great help if a D270 user can share his/her experience with linux usage.\nI read on some forums that there is some linux driver issue with Intel GMA 3600 and that people are not able to adjust their brightness. So, as I am a linux noob is this a major issue or not.\nSpecs:\nRAM : 2Gb DDR3 Processor: Intel N2600(Cedar Trail) Graphics: Intel GMA 3600 HardDisk: 320Gb 5400 rpm\n\nA: Oddly enough, Ubuntu 12.04 installed fine on my Acer Aspire One D270 and runs at 1024*600 - though it reports an \"unknown\" monitor. I installed Google Chrome, and it runs in-window Apple iTunes trailers at 480p very crisp, no stutter or other degradation.\nI say \"oddly enough\" because when I tried to do a similar install on an Asus x101ch, which also has the Atom N2600 chipset, it will ONLY run at 800*600 no matter what I do. I did try an install of Fedora 17, just released, which is SUPPOSED to support the N2600/GMA3600, but while it installed (on the Asus) at 1024*600, I couldn't install Google Chrome at all - kept calling for software that wasn't installed, but a search through the add software program couldn't find it. (I found Fedora 17 much less user friendly, desktop, than Ubuntu, and believe it or not, I actually LIKE Unity on Ubuntu better than the other desktops I have tried (Linux Mint, LXDE, XFCE).)\nI wish I could find out what voodo allowed Ubuntu 12.04 to install at 1024*600 on the D270, since I may pick up an N2800 Lenovo S110 while I am overseas and would love to run Ubuntu on it, but not if I'm stuck at 800*600 like on the Asus.\nBTW I DON'T think there is software support for any of the advanced features of the GMA 3600, it seems to be running at a simple generic VESA level without any hardware acceleration, but with the dual cores of the N2600 it is ok for simple in-browser video, at least. If anybody wants me to hook up an external DVD player to see if it can play DVD's, or see if it can play h.264 rips of DVD's via Handbrake, let me know.\n\nA: (I'm not english speaker-writer, but give me a chance)\nI'm using ubuntu precise (12.04 LTS) in my AOD270. Everything is right for me except the video (VGA, HDMI) output. Fair to say that I do not use quite much graphics and that's almost the only issue that I've noticed (on about 3 weeks of using it with Precise Pangolin) and obviously must take more than the output (the only thing that I care about video). Anyway, if I connect the external monitor before turning on the netbook it works as it only has the external monitor (showing a distorted mirror image in the netbook screen).\nSo it has the issue of the GMA 3600 (output, brightness, 3D, etcetera...), but I've used the rest of the hardware (WLAN, USB, audio, touchpad, etc...) and it works fine. It would be better if while installing you have a LAN conection, in case that you need some [privative] drivers from the intenet before using WLAN (STA Broadcom).\nRight now I'm downloading MeeGo, for installing aside Ubuntu Precise and W7; because I read that it has drivers for de GMA 3600. I've seen other user's commentaries about changing successfully to MeeGo. I think to do it partially, just for using the video outputs, and until ubuntu or another similar linux distro have better perfoncance with the Atom N2600 and the GMA 3600.\nThe other general and I think minor issue is that maybe Ubuntu 12.04 run quite slowly in AOD270 (no more than W7 anyway) because of Unity. But is something of taste I think, and you can always try Xubutnu and Lubuntu.\nIf you hasn't buy the netbook yet, maybe an Asus [or Lenovo] is more friendly hardware for Linux.\nFinally I insist: Ubuntu 12.04 works fine in my AOD270, except the known video issues.\nHope this to be usefull.\nManuel.\n\nA: I installed Linux Mint 13 (based on Ubuntu 12.04) on my D270, and the monitor booted at maximum(or very high brightness), and the fan is continuously running at a high speed. No resolution problems though.\nThe monitor problem I could easily fix by entering in the terminal:\nsudo setpci -s \"00:02.0\" F4.B=35\n\nI ended up adding this line to /etc/rc.local to make it automatic instead of having to change the brightness in the terminal for every session. Change the number at the end(in my case 35) to a lower value to decrease brightness and vice versa.\nNow I have to figure out how to stop the fan running at full speed, because it is loud, and unnecessary when the machine is idle.

I removed the Linpus linux that came along with ACER AOD270 Atom N2600, Intel GMA3600. It runs on Cedar Trail platform (I am not a techee) and intel has incorporated the drivers with their own linux distro Meego 1.2. \nI've tried Ubuntu 12.04 and after installing couldn't adjust the brightness. But after updating it showed to install additional drivers and installed the Cedarview drivers. Those crashed after some time, without much problems and now I am very happy with Linuxmint13. Searched the synaptic for cedar and installed 4 softwares for cedartrial and cedarview and I played a movie 1920x800 nicely. For adjusting brighness , the Fn+ arrow keys worked well. Additional brighness reduction was achieved with RedshiftGUI\n\nA: Okay, I too have an AOD270, and I live in India. So basically everything works except brightness controls and 3D acceleration (so no compiz and other such pretty effects).\nBrightness can be adjusted, although only from Terminal. Other than the display problems, I am absolutely loving this netbook.\n\nA: I managed to make an Eeepc 1025c work almost perfectly (including full video acceleration - 1080p at 10% CPU or less) on Lubuntu 12.04 and wrote a guide about it. Hope it could help:\nhttp://linuxeeepc.blogspot.com/2012/08/lubuntu-on-eeepc-1025c-with-correct.html\nIt should work on similar hardware and different ubuntu variants/derivate but I couldn't check; I hope I get some feedback about it.\n\nA: This week and last week I've put Ubuntu Netbook Remix 10.04 on two D270 Aspire Ones (1Gb RAM) for friends. This has been updated to current Kernel, etc. Installation was quick and painless from USB stick.\nResolution is 1024x600, no problem here, however brightness is fixed level (not a problem) and card reader does not work (needs a driver). The only other quirk I've found is that on wireless connection the icon in top panel does not show an active connection state but reverts to the red ! symbol (proprietary driver downloaded). There is also no 3D, although on a cheap netbook again this isn't really an issue.\nOverall it runs well, as does my old faithful ZG5, and is a big improvement on the Win 7 starter that came installed (I've left this on as a dual boot 'security blanket' for Linux newbies). Nice little machine, super keyboard and loads of battery capacity. Enjoy!\n\nA: I also have mint 13 (kde) running on my d270.  You should not try to update the kernel.  The cedarview driver patch packages only work for 3.2.whatever it is.  The kernel and headers should have been held.  It doesn't really work as well as it should but linux is robust enough that it works.\nI'd be using kubuntu except ubuntu based mint uses an older release, so synaptic was able to do all the configuration for me.\nAs of now I'm waiting for the official 13.04 kubuntu release.  I tried the alpha 2 but I don't have the recovery skills to deal with pre release linux.  But ... before the 2nd or 3rd update it worked very well.  I expected an update to bork the system.  It wasl alpha.\n\nA: I've installed Ubuntu in Acer Aspire D270, and here are a few things that I experienced.\n1) Only Ubuntu 12.04 runs well.\n(I could not install Ubuntu 12.10 well. And I could install Ubuntu 11.04 or 10.10,\nhowever I could not use Wireless Internet. 13.04 beta might be working better than others.)\n2) Updating everything is a bad idea in my case.\n(I once updated everything, and I found somehow Ubuntu failed to load my SDHC card reader,\nwhich worked well before updating.)\n3) Intel GMA 3600 graphic chip is not supported properly.\n(I could not use any 3D graphics and Open-GL well. There was one recommended driver,\nbut when I installed it, it made my graphic even clunkier. I just gave up to use.)\n4) There was a screen brightness problem, and I could fix it.\n(It was too dark, and I could not control with my keyboard.\nI should have used \"sudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=40\" command in terminal.\nI just put this command in a script.)\n5) There is a sleep/suspend/hibernation problem, and I could fix it.\n(It slept well, but when it turned on again, it showed crashed screen.\nI should have used \"pm-suspend --quirk-dpms-on\" command to suspend the system.\nI wrote a line of code to a file in /etc/pm/config.d for a little automation. )\n\nA: I found these indication on webpage: http://nikunjlahoti.com/2012/04/29/ubuntu-12-04-fix-fn-brightness-keys/#comment-672\nStrangely enough they also fix the sleep/resume problem.  \nOpen as root the following file: /etc/default/grub\n$ sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n[sudo] password :\n\nInsert the text: acpi_backlight=vendor, so that the line becomes:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor“\n\nsave and close your editor.  Then update grub, by running in terminal:\n$ sudo update-grub\n\nIt will tell you something like:\nGenerating grub.cfg …\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-24-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-24-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-23-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-23-generic\nFound memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.bin\ndone\n\nAfter that just reboot the machine.\n$ sudo reboot\n\nCaveats:\nAt times the screen would go entirely dark. Or would not apparently resume from a blank screen or when the screensaver gets active.\nFor such cases, all you need to do is press “Fn + Brightness UP button” and screen will GLOW. Simple!!\nTo suspend, just press Fn + F4 (Z') button.

Inevitably, I've coughed up for the latest Humble Bundle, containing 5 games: Amnesia, Bastion, Limbo, Psychonauts and Superbrothers: Sword and Sorcery. At the download page it says download for ubuntu but after that it transpired (after much head scratching) that the three games it lists \"are not available for your version of ubuntu\". \nThe other two, Bastion and Psychonauts \"will appear on the page soon\", but until then does anybody think they might work? I don't want to to be disappointed after downloading a 4gb file, causing me to reminisce on childhood memories of loading 8-bit tape games for 45 minutes only to find out that you had to reload them once you died after 30 seconds in.\n\nA: On the download page, Amnesia and Bastion have .sh downloads, Limbo and Superbrothers have .tar.gz downloads, and Psychonauts has a .zip.  All of those are most likely statically linked and shouldn't depend hugely on a specific version of linux.  \nThat doesn't mean they will necessarily work, but it is pretty good odds that they ship with everything they need. \n\nA: Despite indicating the contrary, Superbrothers works just fine on 10.04. Don't bother with the deb file, as it won't install. Just grab the tar.gz of it, unpack it somewhere, and execute the run.sh script - plays perfectly.\n\nA: Don't they include tar balls, or sh install scripts too?

The following is a screenshot of my current partitions, shown by gparted:\n\nNote that the partitions on the right of /dev/sda3, without labels on them in the figure,\n\n\n*\n\n*are /dev/sda6 (for /home), /dev/sda7 (for /), unallocated, and /dev/sda5 (for swap), from left to right,\n\n*taken together, constitute the contents of the extended partition /dev/sda4.\nI would like to resize the partitions, such that some unused space from /dev/sda7 (for /) and the small unallocated space can be moved to /dev/sda3 (for /windows-d) and make it larger. \nIf this is possible, how can I do it?\n\nA: This is similar to this question, except that there, space outside of an extended partition was moved into an extended partition, and then used by a logical partition (in the extended). In this question, space inside an extended partition needs to be moved out of the extended partition, and used by a primary partition. While the situations are different, I've based this answer on my answer to that question.\nFirst, make sure that:\n\n\n*\n\n*All your documents and other important (i.e., hard to replace) files from all your partitions are backed up. Moving and resizing partitions dynamically carries with it a small risk of data loss (for example, if there is a power failure, if one of your filesystems is broken in a way GParted does not know how to detect, or if there is a bug in GParted), plus you could make a mistake and accidentally wipe something out.\n\n*You are running from a live CD/DVD or USB flash drive, rather than running GParted out of the installed Ubuntu system. It is unsafe (and would almost certainly not succeed) to dynamically move and resize partitions on the same physical disk as the OS you use to do it.\nProvided that this is taken care of, you have to perform 4 (or 5) operations. It will definitely take a while for GParted to perform them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink /dev/sda7 (/) down to whatever size you like. Remember to leave some space, because you need to have some free space on / for Ubuntu to update and install software, store non-user-specific files (including global configuration files), keep system logs, and so that applications can store data in /var and /tmp.\n\n\n*\n\n*I recommend shrinking this on the left (i.e., increasing Free space preceding). However, if you are insistent on attempting to reclaim the 3 MiB of space between the end of /dev/sda7 (/) and /dev/sda5 (your swap partition), then you might as well instead shrink it on the right (increasing Free space following), then move the partition to the right. Please note that performing these two separate operations will make things take longer, and is almost certainly not worth it if your goal is to maximize available space. On the other hand, if the issue is that you're personally bugged by an ugly partition table, go ahead. ;-)\nThis step creates unallocated space in the extended partition, between /dev/sda6 (/home) and /dev/sda7 (/).\n\n*Move /dev/sda6 (/home) as far to the right as it will go, inside the extended partition. This moves the unallocated space to the very beginning (i.e., left side) of the extended partition.\n\n*Shrink /dev/sda4 (the extended partition) on the left (increasing the Free space preceding). When I tried this to make sure it would work properly, I found that it did, but that I had to manually specify a different Free space preceding number. Once I supplied any number manually, I was then able to shrink my extended partition easily by dragging its left edge to the right (as you'd expect to be able to do from the get-go). I'm not sure if you will experience this issue, but if you do, you can use that workaround.\nThis step moves the unallocated space out of the the extended partition.\n\n*Expand /dev/sda3 (/windows-d) on the right as much as possible (decreasing Free space following), so that its right edge is flush with (or as close as possible to) the left edge of /dev/sda4 (the extended partition you've just shrunk down).\nThis step moves eliminates the unallocated space, converting it into free space inside your /dev/sda3 Windows partition.\nYou must apply your changes to get GParted to perform the operations. To do this, click the green check-mark. After the operations complete, make sure your partition layout looks the way you want it, and quit GParted.\nSince you have no separate /boot partition, the boot files for your Ubuntu system are located in the / partition (/dev/sda7). Since you have changed where this partition starts (i.e., the location of its left edge), and where the extended partition that contains it starts, it's likely that your Ubuntu system will not be able to boot. Fortunately, fixing this is easy, and consists of reinstalling GRUB2 (your boot loader) to your Master Boot Record.\nIf you want to try shutting down / restarting the live CD/DVD/USB system and booting into your Ubuntu system at this point, you can, but it's likely enough that you'll have to reinstall GRUB2 to the MBR that I recommend just doing it before rebooting. You can use any of the methods presented here.\nSince you'll probably have to do this, I'll detail one method in this answer (with specifics of your system filled in). In the live CD/DVD/USB system, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run these commands:\nsudo mount /dev/sda7 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sda\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nThen reboot into the Ubuntu system installed on the hard disk, to make sure everything is working. It's also a good idea to boot into the Windows, and make sure it recognizes the NTFS partition. If Windows wants to perform a chkdsk scan and fix problems, you should let it.\n\nA: You should be able to do it in steps.  If it were me, I don't know if I'd tell it to do all the steps in one big operation, but that's only because I'd worry that it might take so long that I'd want to interrupt it for some reason.\nYou'll need to shrink the partitions in the Extended partition, moving them as far to the right as possible.  Then, you want to shrink the Extended partition itself, leaving room on the left.  Then, you should be able to make the primary partition sda3 bigger.\n", "Q: Which version of OpenMP implements gcc 4.5? I am using Ubuntu 11.04.

Well, do-release-upgrade is failing miserably. Here is the output, with duplicate lines and such removed (still > 1500 lines): http://paste.ubuntu.com/1018546/\nYeah. I found this question, which seems to mention similar errors, but I've tried all of the suggestions given there and nothing has changed.\nI tried running apt-get dist-upgrade; it churned for a while and eventually came back with \"Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?\"  Ran apt-get update and got much the same kinds of error messages I got from do-release-upgrade.\nThe following are samples of the outputs that raise my eyebrow (line numbers reference the pastebin code):\n\n\n*\n\n*Ign http://us.archive.ubuntu.com natty InRelease (e.g. line 43)--don't know if this is a problem or not, but it shows up frequently\n\n*Err http://security.ubuntu.com natty-security/restricted amd64 Packages (e.g. line 101)\n\n*bzip2: (stdin) is not a bzip2 file.

Here's the post-mortem:\nOver the weekend, I did some more searching for similar problems--specifically 404 errors while upgrading. This page among others suggested that it might just be a temporary problem with the mirror site. Okay, I thought, I'll try changing mirrors when I get in on Monday.\nThe first thing I tried to do Monday was install a software package. It failed, of course--this problem affects apt-get just as much as do-release-upgrade. Just for kicks, I ran apt-get update again, just to watch it fail--but this time it succeeded. I was able to install my package. Next I ran apt-get dist-upgrade; it still had some errors, but fewer than before. So today, I tried the do-release-upgrade--and it worked. Hooray!\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: Temporary problems with the mirror site(s)--either us.archive.ubuntu.com, or security.ubuntu.com, or both. It's also possible I had transient network issues, although I think that's less likely.\nRECOMMENDED SOLUTION: Wait a couple weeks and try again. If that doesn't work, switch mirrors. (See the list of archive mirrors. I'm sure there are good online tutorials for how to switch, though I'm too lazy to look them up right now).\nHope this helps somebody.

I used to always have my computer come on at a certain time every day before I came home from work, and I had backups scheduled for this time.\nThis worked even if the computer was totally turned off, not on standby.  Of course, it had to have power available (it was a desktop).\nIt's pretty hard to give exact directions, because it depends on computer and BIOS.  But you need to press the secret key while booting to get into the BIOS, then poke around to find the power settings.\nTurning off is, as you've said, done by various software, including cron.\n", "Q: What do I need to do to start working with Launchpad again on a new computer? I have followed the directions listed at http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/getting-set-up.html to get my desktop computer set up so that I could work on bug fixing during 12.04's development.\nNow I am trying to get set up again on my laptop computer (different machine) so I can help contribute to Ask Ubuntu badge integration with the Ubuntu Accomplishments system. However, when I try to run the first command listed to do a bzr branch, I get the following error in my terminal:\nPermission denied (publickey).\nConnectionReset reading response for 'BzrDir.open_2.1', retrying\nPermission denied (publickey).\nbzr: ERROR: Connection closed: Unexpected end of message. Please check connectivity and permissions, and report a bug if problems persist.\n\nWhat do I need to do to get set up and ready to work again on a new machine? Should I just follow all the steps in the first link again (even though they seem to assume it's your first time getting set up with Launchpad)? Or are there steps I should skip / do differently?\nNote: I do not have access to my original desktop machine at this time.\n\nA: On your old machine, you generated a SSH key and then added that to your Launchpad account. Bzr uses that key to acces launchpad. So if the key on your new machine doesn't match the one you uploaded to Launchpad, you will be unable to branch code from certain repositories on Launchpad.\nTwo solutions are possible. The first is of course to transfer your SSH keys from the old machine. You'd need to bring over two files: .ssh/id_rsa and .ssh/id_rsa.pub. Watch the permissions, as SSH is very strict about that.\nThe second solution, if you have no access to your old machine BUT you can log into your Launchpad account, is to add a new SSH key so that Launchpad will let the new machine access bzr branches, since it will identify the new key as belonging to you.\nFor this, on the Getting Set Up document you posted, follow the steps for \"Create your SSH key\" and \"Upload your SSH key to Launchpad\".\nThis will at least allow you to run bzr branch without problems.\nSo in a nutshell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run ssh-keygen -t rsa\n\n*Open .ssh/id_rsa.pub using a text editor (gedit will do)\n\n*Copy the entire contents of the file (one very long line).\n\n*Open https://launchpad.net/~/+editsshkeys on your browser\n\n*Under \"Add an SSH key\", paste the line from step 3, then click on \"Import Key\".\n\n", "Q: How to auto-install runlevel control for existing service/daemon?

I have a MacBook Pro. \nI've heard rumours that if Windows 8 is going to have this thing called \"Secure boot\", Wubi cannot work.  At first I plan to install Ubuntu on my mac via Wubi(and windows via bootcamp), but since I can't find my Windows 7 Installation CD, I  installed Windows 8 on my Mac and installed Ubuntu on a VM.\nThen suddenly Windows 8 Release Preview was released so I decided to  install over my existing copy of Windows 8 Consumer Preview.\nWhen I went to the Windows 8 Upgrade assistant, it said that the firmware on my Mac doesn't support Secure booting.

I haven't gotent this to work because when I try to select an existing drive nothing is being listed. My best guess as to why this is, is because I'm using virt-manager over ssh and not connecting as root, should that make a difference?\nThe second solution I've found here is to just run the command (modified for my system)\nqm set nas4free -virtio /dev/sda\n\nbut that seems to require proxmox which I don't have installed and doesn't seem to be in the default repositories? \nFinally, once the above is sorted out and I can mount the drive directly to the VM, does anyone have an experience with whether the drive should be mounted to the VM as scsi, ide, or virtio? (I know virtio was recommend in the linked ServerFault page, but I hadn't heard of it before now since I mainly use VMWare).\nThanks for your help!!! \n\nA: Having the exact same need, I found the following.\n(the whole following text comes from the above source)\n\nIt can’t be done with virt-manager. That one took me a while to figure out. As far as I can tell, virt-manager works with storage pools. You can make a disk into a storage pool, but you can’t add an existing disk directly to a VM.\nLuckily the fix is easy: you add the disk to the domain’s xml config file by hand. So open up /etc/libvirt/qemu/.xml in your favourite editor and add a  section to the  section:\n\n<disk type='block' device='disk'>\n  <driver name='qemu' type='raw'/>\n  <source dev='/dev/md/storage'/>\n  <target dev='vdb' bus='virtio'/>\n</disk>\n\n\nThis will make the host’s /dev/md/storage available in the guest as /dev/vdb. After changing a domain’s config by hand, you have to reload the config by hand. Log in to your host and issue this command:\n\n# virsh define /etc/libvirt/qemu/jetsetetser.xml\nDomain jetser defined from /etc/libvirt/qemu/jetsetetser.xml\n\n\nHere is a nice resource with more information about managing vms with libvirt : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Managing\n\nI strongly recommend you follow the advice given by smccloud. This works like a charm for me. Beware to not mount any volume in the physical drives used in your guest, or you will severely damage its filesystem !\n\nA: Although this has been answered, rather than using /dev/sda you should use /dev/disk/by-id/ where you get  from\n    ls -l /dev/disk/by-id\n\nThat way you are covered just in case the disk changes from /dev/sda to /dev/sdb.\n", "Q: Clocks for multiple timezones in GNOME Shell I looked everywhere but I couldn't find a way to display multiple clocks in GNOME 3.

For more info see the Github page.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the extension (when your GNOME Shell is ready for it)\n\n*Create a text-file with the name people.json (*example code see below)\n\n*Place the file where you like.\n\n*Edit the settings of the extensions in Ubuntu Tweak or directly on the extension-page when you have the Firefox Gnome extension add-on and set where the json-file is placed, e.g. file:///home/USERNAME/people.json.\n\n*Logout & login or Alt-F2 with command r (or maybe a restart is needed)\n\n\n*Example code for people.json:\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"California\",\n    \"avatar\": \"file:///home/USERNAME/Pictures/California.JPG\",\n    \"city\": \"Los Angeles\",\n    \"tz\": \"America/Los_Angeles\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Hans Pacquiao\",\n    \"avatar\": \"file:///home/cds/Pictures/Hans.JPG\",\n    \"city\": \"Indiana\",\n    \"tz\": \"America/Indiana/Knox\"\n  },\n  {\n   \"name\": \"Samar friends\",\n   \"avatar\": \"file:///home/USERNAME/Pictures/Samarfriends.ico\",\n   \"city\": \"Philippines\",\n   \"tz\": \"Asia/Manila\"\n  }\n]\n\nFor more time zones information, see Wikipedia.\n\nA: I found gnome-clocks on Launchpad. It can be installed with:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-clocks \n\nAs of 18.04 LTS. It looks like this:\n\n\nA: Today there is MultiClock, a Gnome 3 Extension that puts another clock into your bar.\nReally useful and allow multiple timezones.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/605/multiclock/\n\n*Source: https://github.com/mibus/MultiClock\nOnly drawback is you need to know how to edit JavaScript for its configuration:\ngedit ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/MultiClock@mibus.org/extension.js\n\nBut it's not hard. In the file change the following variables according to your timezone parameters\nconst Timezones = {\n    'GMT',\n    'Australia/Adelaide',\n    'Australia/Perth',\n    'America/Denver',\n\n};\n\nNOTE: Must use formatting found in TZ Database Time Zones!\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\n\nA: Have you tried the clock applet from the Screenlets? You can have multiple clocks set to different time zones.\nYou can install screenlet by doing sudo apt-get install screenlets in terminal.\nYou can add/remove individual clocks. And set individual/all clocks to autostart at login.\n\nA: I use FoxClocks, which is an add-on for Firefox.\nWhile it is not in Unity/Gnome, I normally have Firefox open anyhow.\n\nA: An extension that puts different clocks directly on the top bar is Panel Work Clock Lite. It appears to be well maintained as of the writing of this answer.\n", "Q: What spelling dictionaries does Ubuntu use? Do all applications use the same dictionary for spell checking? If not, which applications use which dictionaries in a typical desktop installation, or where can I find out?\n\nA: Some apps are using a common dictionary (such as Evolution, which use aspell-* packages). Some apps are using their own dictionary, such as Libreoffice, which uses libreoffice-l10n-[language code] and language-support-writing-[language code] packages.\n", "Q: VirtualBox Windows Key Pass Through To Gnome I use a VirtualBox Windows 7 guest in seamless mode on an Ubuntu 12.04 linux host running Gnome 3.\nUnder normal operation when VirtualBox is not running, pressing the Windows Key on the keyboard launches the Gnome activity panel.\nWhen the Windows guest is running and is in the foreground, pressing the Windows Key opens the Windows menu inside the guest.\nIs there anyway to configure it so that the Windows Key will be ignored by the guest, and passed through to the host?\n\nA: ubuntu-20.04 as host and windows-10 as guest here.\nI have similar problem but solve in a different way. I leave my guest fullscreen in a empty workspace and use hot-corners to switch between workspaces (guest and host)\n\nThis are my steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*add this extension https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1362/custom-hot-corners/\n\n*create workspace.next and workspace.previous scripts\n\n*link hot corners to scripts and set \"enable in full screen mode\"\n\n\ncat workspace.next\n#!/bin/bash\nCURRENT_WS=`wmctrl -d | grep \\* | cut -d \" \" -f 1`\nMAX_WS=`wmctrl -d | tail -n 1 | cut -d \" \" -f 1 `\nNEXT_WS=$((CURRENT_WS+1))\nif (( NEXT_WS > MAX_WS )); then\n    NEXT_WS=0\nfi\nwmctrl -s $NEXT_WS\n\ncat workspace.previous\n#!/bin/bash\nCURRENT_WS=`wmctrl -d | grep \\* | cut -d \" \" -f 1`\nMAX_WS=`wmctrl -d | tail -n 1 | cut -d \" \" -f 1 `\nNEXT_WS=$((CURRENT_WS-1))\nif (( NEXT_WS < 0)); then\n    NEXT_WS=$MAX_WS\nfi\nwmctrl -s $NEXT_WS\n\n\nA: Yes.  Open the VirtualBox Manager window, and go to \"File\" menu, \"Preferences\" (Ctrl-G).\nUnder \"Input\", uncheck the box labeled \"Auto Capture Keyboard\".  There is no need to restart the VM if it's running, so this can be changed \"on the fly\".\n", "Q: If I don't use KDE why does updating download lots of kde packages?

The packages were probably installed as dependencies of other applications. They might be removable without affecting those other packages, or they might not. Either way, you can find out what would be removed by uninstalling them by simulating the deinstallation:\napt-get -s remove packagename\nReplace packagename with the name of the package. You can list more than one, separated by spaces, but I recommend listing just one per run, so you can see specifically what each package is installed for.\nIf additional packages are listed to be removed, then you know that if you remove packagename, you lose those packages, too. It's possible that there are other packages that can benefit from some of packagename's functionality, but they will at least not be automatically removed if you remove packagename for real.\nIf you want more information specific to your situation, or want to know about specific packages, then you'll have to edit your question to add that information. In particular, you might consider adding the complete text from the Terminal, so we see exactly what KDE-related packages are installed and being updated on your system. While you've provided some very general information in comments to your question, really the specific and exact name of each package would be needed to give you finely tuned advice. (But you might be able to get all the information you need, just with the general advice in this answer.)\n\nA: \nNo kde installed\n\nProbably this is wrong argument ,because you may not installed kde-plasma-workspace(the DE). But you already installed ,some kde apps(?) . Depending upon the type of the kde app ,they pull ,different kde dependancies from the repository , Nothing wrong with it \n", "Q: \"Limbo\" game has no sound I just bought a game called Limbo in Humble Bundle V. The site says that all games are cross-platform but in my computer the game has no sound. I've searched in google and looked in the official FAQ, but none of them helped me.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: I got sound working after killing pulse audio. You'll have to get rid of the autospawn feature though.  \nSee : \nhttp://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=1457&sid=b61a832efcbda1807f7d3791e7a46a67\nSummary:\nsudo nano /etc/pulse/client.conf\n\n(Or use editor of choice instead of nano.)\nUncomment and change the autospawn line as follows:\n; autospawn = yes\nautospawn = no\n\nOtherwise pulseaudio will always restart.\nIn a terminal, killall pulseaudio . This kills pulseaudio for your current session.\n\nA: I've managed to get it working with sound on 12.04 in following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the Wine PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nwinetricks directx9\nwinecfg \n\n\n*Change d3dx9_43 to \"(native,builtin)\" in Libraries tab\n\n*Download windows package and install it with wine.\n\n*Launch windows LIMBO!\n\n\nA: According to an email I got from the Humble Bundle support:\n\nA new version of Limbo is being uploaded to the download pages today that should fix the Linux sound issue. Please check back on your download page for the updated timestamp below the download buttons on that page and try out the new version.\n\nThe update from the Ubuntu Software Center will probably appear soon too, as they confirmed in a second email:\n\nCodeweavers is still finishing up the update, but we will have that posted to the download pages and the Ubuntu Center as soon as possible.\n\nAnd indeed, I checked the last version that was updated: sound works fine now.\n\nA: Sadly Limbo is just the Windows version with an emulator called wine bundled ‐ it is known for flakey audio. You may have to wait for them to update the release.\n\nA: From what I can tell, the bundled version tries to talk to ALSA directly and this doesn't work while you have PulseAudio running. Simple solution: pasuspender ./launch-limbo.sh. Complex solution: make Limbo use your system version of Wine.\n\nA: Here is my workaround on getting Sound in the Linux version of LIMBO.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add your user to the audio group\nsudo adduser username audio\n\n*Run a seperate xserver\n\n*\n\n*Press CTRL+ALT+F1 and log in with your username and password\n\n*enter xinit -- :1 to start the second xserver\n\n*you can now switch between this and your regular desktop with CTRL+ALT+F7 and ...-F8\n\n\n*run the game with pasuspender (you might need to move the mouse inside the xterm in the top-left before you can enter text).\npasuspender /opt/limbo/launchlimbo.sh\n\n*When you're done, change to VT1 with CTRL+ALT+F1 and press CTRL+C to kill the second XServer. Now you can go back to your regular desktop with ...-F7.\n\n\nA: Download Windows version (.exe) and run it under Wine (check for it on the Ubuntu Software Center), follow the wizard, answer yes when asking for directx install and everything will work fine, I'm playing it now :)\nBasically that's what the .deb package does, but doing it manually will not encounter in bugs like that.\n\nA: First try restarting pulseaudio:\nIn a terminal (ctrl+alt+t) type: (that's two minus (-) characters)\n\npulseaudio --kill\n\nThen give it a few seconds to restart itself (watch the volume icon in the top right), then launch Limbo.\nLimbo works fine for me with no special audio configurations mentioned in the other answers, but It (and wine in general) sometimes has issues with pulseaudio.  In my case a restart of pulseaudio fixes it.\nNote, you may or may not need to restart other programs that use sound (like firefox) after restarting pulseaudio.\n", "Q: Can't find Ubuntu 12.04 on boot menu So I installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows XP on my netbook via a usb (since it doesn't have a DVD/CD drive).\nAt the end of the installation, I got an error saying the bootloader couldn't be installed, but I selected the hard drive and everything seemed ok.\nHowever, whenever I turn on the computer, it goes straight to Windows XP.

The only problem that makes the laptop wake up are two USB components that need to be disabled. To do that edit the file /etc/rc.local:\n\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\n\nIt should look like this:\n\n #!/bin/sh-e\n # Rc.local\n # This script is Executed at the End of Each multiuser runlevel.\n # Make sure the script That will \"exit 0\" on success or Any Other\n # Value on error.\n #\n # In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n # Bits.\n #\n # By default this script does nothing.\n\n # Added by Carlos TD\n\n echo US15 | sudo tee /proc/acpi/wakeup\n echo USB0 | sudo tee /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\n exit 0\n\n\nAll I did was add these two commands:\necho US15 | sudo tee /proc/acpi/wakeup\necho USB0 | sudo tee /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nThese orders are for USB components that did not allow the laptop to remain suspended. Disabling it from the local file does not affect the system\nIf you want to see all the USB components enabled to wake the laptop, this is the command. You will notice that these two are no\n  longer enabled (of course after reboot):\n\ncat /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\n\nThis very good and simple solution I found this forum, and then adapted it to my eeepc. I think it is for many laptops with this\n  problem. You only need to adapt the trick to each machine by testing out which USB devices are the problem. You can test by running the above mentioned command for each device and testing sleep functionality.\n  I found it on this forum: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1969615\n\n\nA: On my Asus 1201N, adding only\necho US15 | sudo tee /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nto /etc/rc.local fixed the problem with suspend.\n\nA: On the HP Envy dv6, the following works on 13.10 (after upgrade from 13.04; 13.04 had no  suspend issues) using acpitool(1).\n\n\n*\n\n*use acpitool -w to list wakeup capable devices. \n\n\n\nDevice S-state   Status   Sysfs node\n  ---------------------------------------\n  1.

I've been on Linux for more than 6 months now but never went too much into the CLI (command-line interface or terminal or shell)\nNow as I ask questions here, get answers, or help from other sites, I learn new commands...\nHow can I can store every new command in a text file? Only new/unique commands, not repetitions of the same command.\nHere's an example: \n\n\n*\n\n*In the terminal, I enter the commands like this-\n\n\n$  command1\n$  command2\n$  command3\n$  command4\n$  command1\n\n\n*Now, these commands should get saved in a text file say commandrec like this\n\n\ncommand1\ncommand2\ncommand3\ncommand4\nNOTE: The last command in the terminal which was again command1 is not recorded/saved again in the text file.\nAnd the next time I open the terminal, and enter a new command command 5, it should get appended to the list in commandrec\n(but if the command was used earlier on some other date, it should still be ignored. For example, command 1 entered again along with command 5 on a new day/time but command1 not recorded as already used)\n\n\n*The commandrec file will be looking something like this\n\n\n31/05/12 12:00:00\ncommand1\ncommand2\ncommand3\ncommand4\n01/06/12 13:00:00\ncommand 5\n(the time and date thing would be great if possible, but okay even if that isn't there)\nThis way, I can have a record of all commands used by me to date.\nHow can this be done?\n\nA: How to successfully experiment with changing these settings in .bashrc\n\n\n*\n\n*Before experimenting: Save your current .bash_history to another file with cp.\n\n*While experimenting with what works: rm ~/.bash_history after you change .bashrc with history control parameters, otherwise the combo of old and new entries may give you weird results.\n\n*\n\n*e.g., all entries before timestamps were enabled will show the same current date/time!\n\n\n*Once you find something that works, DO NOT rm any more!!\n\n*Note also that any changes to .bashrc are reflected only when you exit and then instantiate a new terminal/shell.\nIncreasing history size and eliminating duplicates\n\n\n*\n\n*Add these lines to your ~/.bashrc:\n\nexport HISTCONTROL=erasedups\nexport HISTSIZE=10000\n\n*History size is set to 10000, duplicates are automatically eliminated so it's plenty of space :)\nTimestamping\n\n\n*\n\n*Time can be set easily by adding another line of the form export HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%F %T\", this will display the time/date before each line when using history\n\n*\n\n*Example: \n\nizx@preciseunity:~$ history\n1  2012-06-01 07:16:22 rm ~/.bash_history\n2  2012-06-01 07:16:23 exit\n3  2012-06-01 07:16:27 ls\n4  2012-06-01 07:16:31 test\n5  2012-06-01 07:16:34 ls /etc\n6  2012-06-01 07:16:36 down\n7  2012-06-01 07:16:37 up\n8  2012-06-01 07:16:40 hustory\n9  2012-06-01 07:16:48 history\n\n\n*Note that because duplicates are eliminated, the time shown for a command is the latest (newest) time it was last executed.\n\n*You can customize the HISTTIMEFORMAT to your choice/locale based on strftime\n\nA: Your aim is to learn new commands? I recommand to use CLI Companion:\n\nCLI Companion is a tool to store and run Terminal commands from a GUI. People unfamiliar with the Terminal will find CLI Companion a useful way to become acquainted with the Terminal and unlock its potential. Experienced users can use CLI Companion to store their extensive list of commands in a searchable list.\n\n\nYou get it by running:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:clicompanion-devs/clicompanion-nightlies\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install clicompanion\n\nIf you don't want to add the PPA try this file for 12.04 (latest version 1.1-6, released on 2012-04-14 - check this page for newer versions.) - or remove the PPA after installing with sudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:clicompanion-devs/clicompanion-nightlies .\n\nPS: I found this question which could be helpful, too.\n\nA: Going on Dirk's suggestion of going through .bash_history and chris's suggestion of using the sort command, what you probably want to do is:\ncat ~/.bash_history | sed 's/sudo //g' | sort -u +0 -0 | cut -d\\  -f1 > commandrec.txt\n\nSecond command in the pipeline will delete occurrences of 'sudo ' so when you sort you will sort the commands that you may type only after invoking sudo.   \nBash history doesn't keep track of the time/date the command was used, but just off the top of my head, you could write a script that will be invoked when you exit the terminal.  The script would call the above command (but save to commandrec-$DATE.txt where you have something like DATE = `date \"+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S\"`).  Then you could diff with .bash-history and keep only the new commands in commandrec-$DATE.txt.  So you would have a collection of such dated commandrec files.  Actually, since .bash_history is limited (I think default on my system was 500), you should probably diff with the file you get by cat-ing all your commandrec*.txt files and .bash_history.  \nThen anytime you actually want to look at all your commands to date, you can cat all your files to a file.\n\nA: Timestamping is easy. To do it, just add the following line to ~/.profile or\nsimilar:\nHISTTIMEFORMAT='%x %r '\n\nTo uniqely record every new command is tricky. First you need to add to\n~/.profile or similar:\nHISTCONTROL=erasedups\nPROMPT_COMMAND='history -w'\n\nThen you need to add to ~/.bash_logout:\nhistory -a\nhistory -w\n\n\nA: in your home directory check the .bash_history file, it saves every command you enter\n\nA: How about a simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Grab the information from .bash_history (All commands used in the terminal)\n\n*Sort them out Alphabetically\n\n*Show only Uniques\n\n*Send them to a file\n\n\ncat .bash_history|sort|uniq > commands.txt\nIf you only want the command (Without taking parameters into consideration) a simple cut will do:\ncat .bash_history|cut -d ' ' -f1|sort|uniq > commands.txt\nIf you want to know how many times a command was executed you could:\ncat .bash_history|cut -d ' ' -f1|sort|uniq -c > commands.txt\n", "Q: \"who\" command - How to show IP address I would like to know if there is an option to get the IP address of loged users with who command?\nWhen I type who I get this:\n\nwolfy@wolfy-server:~$ who\nwolfy    pts/0        2012-06-01 09:43 (tzu-23-764-657.sta.als.some.net)\n\nI would like to replace \"tzu-23-764-657.sta.als.some.net\" with a real IP address, like in \"last\" command:\n\nwolfy@wolfy-server:~$ last -i\nwolfy    pts/0        123.123.123.123  Fri Jun  1 09:43   still logged in\n\nI did not find any options to do that... do you know a way to do this... maybe a different command?\n\nA: You can use the --ips switch.\nTo quote the manual:\n\n--ips\nPrint  ips  instead  of  hostnames.

I don't want to think about administrating my trash, but I don't want to accidentally delete something either. Am I the only one with that opinion?\n\nA: Try with Autotrash!\nAutotrash is a simple Python script comes with Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat which will purge files from your trash when they become older than a given days,purge older files to ensure a specific amount of disk space is free,etc.It uses the FreeDesktop.org Trash Info files included in the new GNOME system to find the correct files and the dates they where deleted.\nFeatures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove files that are older then a given number of days\n(autotrash -d N,where N is the number of days)\n\n*Purge older files to ensure a specific amount of disk space is free\n(autotrash --min-free=M,M is the amount of free space you want to ensure you have, in megabytes.)\n\n*Check for remaining disk space, and only delete if you are running out\n(autotrash --max-free=M,M is the amount of free space left, in megabytes.)\n\n*Delete regex matching files first (see –delete-frist option)\n\n\nFor more info,execute this in terminal:\nautotrash --help\nAutoTrash is already in Ubuntu 10.10′s repository,it can be installed from Ubuntu Software Center.For Ubuntu 10.04 and 9.10 user,install this from PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install autotrash\n\nInfo: http://www.logfish.net/pr/autotrash/\nSource: http://ubuntuguide.net/automatically-delete-files-older-than-n-days-from-trash-using-autotrash/\nFor a different approach and a more comprehensive guide: http://helpdeskgeek.com/linux-tips/automatically-empty-the-trash-in-ubuntu/\n\nA: Use trash-cli \n(click image to install or run sudo apt-get install trash-cli).\nRun trash-empty 30 to remove all files from trash which are older than 30 days. (You can change this number as you like.)\nTo automate this, add a command to Startup Applications:\n\n\nPlease note: If you use older Ubuntu versions than 12.04, the command is empty-trash!\n\nA: If you're on GNOME, there's now a feature for that!

Recently I installed both operating systems, Ubuntu was the last one, and after that my computer was booting directly to Windows 7. I used my Ubuntu USB live to repair the grub, and could repair. Now I initiate my pc with grub 1.99 and Ubuntu and Windows are recognized, but Windows gives an error and don't initiate, suggesting to use Windows DVD to repair the grub. I tried that but with no effects on be behavior. \nI have a new asus n56vm. This conflicts with gpt and mbr have been a huge pain to me. I don't know what to to, I installed Ubuntu and Windows numerous times since I bought this computer 2 weeks ago.\n\nA: Since you have installed Ubuntu and Windows lot of times since you bought the laptop my solution might make you install it once more. What you are facing is a problem related to UEFI.\nI am assuming that using UEFI or GPT isn't very important to you. So this is how you can get both Ubuntu and Windows to work on your system : \n\n\n*\n\n*Go into BIOS and disable UEFI. Save settings and restart and go into BIOS again\n\n*If somewhere there is a setting to delete boot options then delete\nall the boot options. Though I am pretty sure that you cannot delete\nCD/DVD from boot option but if you can then don't do it. Save\nall settings and restart and go into BIOS again.\n\n*Put your windows DVD in the drive\n\n*Somewhere (mostly on the last tab of your BIOS) you will find an\noption for boot override. Select your DVD drive and press enter.\nRemember that this boot over ride option should NOT have UEFI\nin it's name.\n\n*You will now boot from windows DVD through BIOS in non-UEFI mode.\n\n*During windows installation select \"custom install\" and then delete\nall existing partitions on your harddisk. Create partition for\nwindows. When creating this partition windows will automatically\nmake another small partition of about 100MB size as system reserved.\nLeave the rest of the unallocated space for now. We will take care\nof that space while installing Ubuntu.\n\n*Once windows installation is done put your Ubuntu CD in the drive\nand boot from it again\n\n*During installation of Ubuntu select the option \"do something else\"\nand create a primary partition for Ubuntu.\n\n*Now after creating partition for Ubuntu click on the rest of the\nunallocated space and click on create new partition again. But this\ntime slected extended partition\n\n*Once you create extended partition you see that all your\n unallocated space is being shown under that unallocated partition\n in a sub menu. In this unallocated space you make rest of your\n partitions like linux-swap (necessary for linux to work efficiently\n and for hibernate to work correctly) and other partitions for your\n data.\n\n*Make sure that the bootloader device is sda without any partition\n number after it.\n\n*Proceed with installation. If everything goes well you should be\n successfully dual booting in both Ubuntu and Windows\n\n\nNote 1 : If you do not use a USB drive to boot instead of DVD drive then follow the same steps and just use USB drive each time while booting from BIOS.\nNote 1 : If using UEFI and GPT is important to you then you might want to follow this guide : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting\nHope this helps. :)\n\nA: Reinstalling grub can perhaps resolve the trick\n\n\n*\n\n*Start with Ubuntu USB Live\n\n*Open a terminal then switch in chroot mode, by example:\n\nmount -t ext4 /dev/sda /mnt/tmp   \nmount -t proc none /mnt/tmp/proc\nmount -o bind /dev /mnt/tmp/dev\nchroot /mnt/tmp /bin/bash\n\n\n\n*Execute grub-install /dev/sda\n\nA: If you need to just access Windows and don't have time for any of the above, try using Hiren's Boot CD. It allows to boot a partition directly by just booting from the disk. It's an invaluable toolkit too!\n", "Q: Software index broken When I was installing MTS Mblaz crossplatformui.deb for MTS data connect, its installed partial and shows error, and So I tried to uninstall \"crossplatformui\" but every time it showed following error.\ninstallArchives() failed: perl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\n    LANGUAGE = (unset),\n    LC_ALL = (unset),\n    LANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\n    are supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\n    LANGUAGE = (unset),\n    LC_ALL = (unset),\n    LANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\n    are supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\n    LANGUAGE = (unset),\n    LC_ALL = (unset),\n    LANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\n    are supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\n(Reading database ... \n(Reading database ... 5%\n(Reading database ... 10%\n(Reading database ... 15%\n(Reading database ... 20%\n(Reading database ... 25%\n(Reading database ... 30%\n(Reading database ... 35%\n(Reading database ... 40%\n(Reading database ... 45%\n(Reading database ... 50%\n(Reading database ... 55%\n(Reading database ... 60%\n(Reading database ... 65%\n(Reading database ... 70%\n(Reading database ... 75%\n(Reading database ... 80%\n(Reading database ... 85%\n(Reading database ... 90%\n(Reading database ... 95%\n(Reading database ... 100%\n(Reading database ... 205769 files and directories currently installed.)\nRemoving crossplatformui ...\nztemtvcdromd: no process found\ndpkg: error processing crossplatformui (--remove):\n subprocess installed post-removal script returned error exit status 1\nNo apport report written because MaxReports is reached already\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n crossplatformui\nSetting up firmware-b43-installer (4.150.10.5-5) ...\n--2012-06-01 14:11:21--  http://mirror2.openwrt.org/sources/broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.tar.bz2\nResolving mirror2.openwrt.org... 46.4.11.11\nConnecting to mirror2.openwrt.org|46.4.11.11|:80... failed: Connection refused.\ndpkg: error processing firmware-b43-installer (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 4\n\n\nA: Follow these steps carefully.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /var/lib/dpkg/info/crossplatformui.postrm.

For example, to run \"digiKam\" with the environment variable APPMENU_DISPLAY_BOTH=1, find the corresponding digikam.desktop file and add the setting of the variable, via the env command, to the entry \"Exec\": \nExec=env APPMENU_DISPLAY_BOTH=1 digikam -caption \"%c\" %i\n\nIn your case:\nExec=env GTK2_RC_FILES=gtkrc.custom /path/to/eclipse\n\n\nA: An alternative to modify the .desktop file is to put a wrapper script in e.g. ~/bin.\n$ cat ~/bin/eclipse\n#!/bin/sh\nexport GTK2_RC_FILES=gtkrc.custom\nexec /usr/bin/eclipse \"$@\"\n\nThis way the customization won't be overwritten next time the application package is updated.\nEdit:\nA hint about why this works can you see by checking out what the PATH variable contains.

I can close the notification with the \"X\" but clicking options like Allow or Deny does nothing.\nAfter some googling I found that I'm not the only one with this problem but I can't find any fix.\n\nA: It's a bug in the XFCE4 notification daemon\n\n\n*\n\n*This is the kind of problem we're talking about -- clicking on the buttons will perform the appropriate action, but will not dismiss the notification.

(if you need any more information please ask)\n\nA: As recommend reading this question/answer: HDMI/VGA connection cuts borders of screen or creates blurry text for some additional information but the problem might be the actual the configuration for the TV. What I mean with this as for example, you are saying you can have 1920 with a 30 refresh rate. Check /etc/X11/xorg.conf so that the Horizontal/Vertical sync is at least 30. In my case it is 50/60.\nAnother way is to not jump directly to 1920 but rather go slowly towards it. Jump to the next higher resolution. Then the next. At least until you get to 1920. I would recommend using 1680x1050 because many TVs in Ubuntu that mention 1920 work better on 1680.

I was having the same issue, on Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit with dual monitors, even after I turned one of them off. I went into /opt/swordandsworcery/run.sh and uncommented the SDL line. That got me to the segfault issue. Then I went into ~/.capy/SwordAndSworcery/config.txt and found that the width was set to 3840, which is double my single-monitor resolution (or the total resolution when both monitors are on). Switched that to 1920 and everything loaded fine after that.\n", "Q: How to login to internet using web based login while installing 12.04 I am trying to install ubuntu 12.04 on a laptop. But I have an internet connection that requires web based login, where an ISP page in internet browser opens and I have to login to internet using the username and password to start browsing the web.\nWhile installing ubuntu, it tries to download some updates via internet. I am stuck here as I cannot download updates before having to login to internet. Is there any method to login or bypass this situation??\n\nA: Two suggestions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the live cd and setup the wireless then start the install by clicking the icon on the desktop.\n\n*While installing Ubuntu uncheck ‘Download updates while installing’.\n", "Q: Need a professional in ubuntu to help me in how to run silkroad like those ppl? I'm new to Ubuntu, I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x64.\nI could not play Silkroad online, so i asked Google and I found that there's application named Wine, and I found some commands to run in the Terminal, to install it.\nI did all that successfully.\nThen I tried to start the game, via wine, and I got this error.\nNow I don't know what I should do. On Youtube I saw players that can play Silkroad on Ubuntu without problems.\n\nCheck this out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY8AK8M43EQ\nCommands I used to install wine:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.5\n\n\nA: You will need to reinstall it. This is because most software depends on other programs and utilities for it to run; in this case NetEngine. When you install software, the installation utility usually ensures that all dependencies are met so the software will run. Clearly you've copied the Silkroad program & its files, but haven't copied the NetEngine software.\nInstalling it again will ensure it runs.\n", "Q: Atheros 9250 wireless card keeps on disconnecting I bought a Lenovo G575 laptop for learning purposes and found that the connection just simply disconnects when downloading and every 2-5 minutes while browsing.\nI tested the card with Win7, and it worked nicely, so I don't think it's the router.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: There are several reasons for that, possible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*your disk have hardware failure, like I/O errors...\n\n*You have multiple firewalls enabled, and it is better to have only one, maybe \"gufw\" is the best... and it needs to deny all with rules to allow out udp 53 and allow out tcp 25,53,80,110,143,843,993,5060,8080\n\n*Your OS is not with all modules inserted, type: lsmod > list1.txt\nThen create an USB installer with the \"startup disk creator\" using the ISO of your installation CD (a pen of 2 GB is enough) then boot from that USB PEN and choose \"try Ubuntu\" and type there: lsmod > list2.txt and copy this file to the same location the one above and open  both in text editor and see if there is missing modules in list1.txt...\nTo install missing modules use first modinfo \"name of the module\" after the description see if it needs dependencies and install those first if not, just copy the full path of the ko file and type sudo insmod \"paste path/file.ko\", after all modules inserted no need for reboot things should start working fine...\n\n*If you do not use proprietary driver, then might solve the problem due to the fact that the CPU is having trouble to process all the system in realtime, and that lack of CPU speed and Bridge speed causes wi-fi to disconnect, so try to install proprietary driver for your wireless card or disconnect every USB device that is not needed by your system to connect to the internet. If you do not find how to do this, go to \"software center\" and type \"additional drivers\" and if not installed, install it, then start it and activate all drivers available cause it will speed hings up and using less CPU...\n\n*This one is certainly your case, you are booting from an USB disk and using very fast speed which causes system resources to collapse, and has to shutdown one, and because the USB disk is the boot disk it chooses to disconnect the Wi-Fi! Solution is to connect the USB disk to an hub of less speed, like if was connected to USB3, use an USB2 hub which causes the USB disk to work at USB2 speed, if it was using USB2 then use an USB1.1 hub...\n\n*This is a long shot, and at far, your browser internet agent got corrupt or hacked by some intermediary that poses for an \"authority\" of contents provided by you, but this is a false authority, and just a cyberbulling occurence, cause there is no internet content that violates internet rules set by the internet authorities, and besides that you or anyone do not have nothing to do with the contents received, because everyone just enters the URL and the server decides which content to send, like, if two guys access the same URL at the same time, they get different pages content cause the server sends data according to lots of parameters and is configured to apply local country rules, like nudity can be considered ilegal in one country and not in other country. There is also the copyright issue but this also is not possible to violate, cause the copyright is not the act of making copies but the act of posing to be the author, that said, if one uploads copyrighted material without trying to own the copyright does not violate any internacional copyright rule. This two are the most common accusations by false \"authorities\" which makes your agent set your browser ID has an internet criminal act origin, causing every server in the world to disconnect that browser has soon it processes the browser agent, which sometimes takes several minutes... \n", "Q: Is it possible to install the Unity 2D Panel in Kubuntu without pulling in all of Unity's dependencies? I would like to avoid installing Gnome dependencies, if possible. I figured this is possible as Unity 2D is written in Qt. Thanks for your input!\n\nA: Use the following to install a package with only the required dependencies, not the recommended ones (which are usually installed by default):\nsudo apt-get -o APT::Install-Recommends=0 install package1 package2 package3\nWhile Unity 2D may work without some of the required dependencies, it's a very dangerous zone to be meddling in. You can use dpkg with forced removal to remove the ones you think don't matter, after installation with the above.\n", "Q: I can't su as root, my account type is admin BUT am I root? \nPossible Duplicate:\nsu command + authentication failure \n\ni installed ubuntu successfully, but then i tried \"su\" on terminal and entered my password, authentication failed! and I don't think that i'm root, I don't have root permissions, what should I do ? ... I went to user accounts, it says my account type is Administrator, but that's not root is it ??\nthanks :) \n\nA: While using Terminal, Just prefix sudoto the command that you want to execute as root.\nAuthenticate it with your user password.....\nFor example, to install curl, via the root privileges, execute this\nsudo apt-get install curl\n\nIn ubuntu, the root account does exist, However it is not activated by default.\nTough you should avoid this, but if you want to login using the root account, the this is the workout.\nsudo -i\nsudo passwd root\n\nreplace \"passwd\" with the password of your choice that you want for the \"root\" account.\n\nA: Why do you need to run as root?\nThe main difference between Ubuntu (and many other Unix OS') and Windows is that the root account isn't accessible like any other. That is, the password is set to be impossible to enter (Geeks see footnote). If you want to run a program with root privileges, open a terminal and run sudo (program), or gksudo (program) if it's graphical.\nThe root account is \"disabled\" for various reasons, all mainly security related. \nFootnote: Hashed passwords are stored in /etc/shadow, and the root account password hash begins with a !. Since no possible value can be hashed to begin with a !, there is no possible value which can match the root password. (Alternatively, Linus Torvalds knows all the root passwords.)\n\nA: If you want to \"log in as root\" (i.e. enter an interactive session as the root user), you can use this:\nsudo -i\nIn Ubuntu, if you're in the \"sudo\" group, you can even \"become\" any user on your system:\nsudo -i -u whoever\nsu doesn't work because it requires you to know root's password, which as jackweirdy explains, is not set on Ubuntu. I second his advice about not enabling the root account (it can certainly be done), as it's much more secure to use sudo only when you want to run privileged commands, and use your normal account otherwise.\n\nA: If you deadly need root privileges and don't want to use sudo prefix, you can enable root account. Simply run \nsudo passwd root \nfrom your terminal and give password you want. Then log out, choose \"other user\", type name - \"root\", password you gave and log in.\n", "Q: XBMC Passthrough Audio and Pulse With XBMC, there are two audio settings. One is for for stereo audio, and the other is for passthrough audio (If I were to enable AC3 and or DTS then passthrough would be used):\n\nWith the following ubuntu audio settings, if I enable Dolby Digital or DTS then sound does not work when I play any media with those types of streams. However, stereo streams will still work:\n\nIf change the Ubuntu audio settings to Built-in Audio for output, and enable Dolby/DTS then media with those streams will work, but then stereo does not.\nThis makes sense to me because if I have my CM8738 selected via Ubuntu then XBMC couldn't access it because pulse has it in use. The flip side where I set Ubuntu audio to Built-in I am no longer using the sound device hooped up to my speakers, but then CM8738 is freed up for passthrough/AC3/DTS from XBMC.\nWhat I would like, is of course, for both to work at the same time (without having to change device via Ubuntu or inputs on my receiver). I want to pass DTS or AC3 directly to my receiver for those streams, but still have stereo within XBMC and outside of XBMC to work. Am I asking for too much? Or can this be done?\nFor reference here is the output of aplay -l:\n**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: CMI8768 [C-Media CMI8768], device 0: CMI8738-MC8 [C-Media PCI DAC/ADC]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: CMI8768 [C-Media CMI8768], device 1: CMI8738-MC8 [C-Media PCI 2nd DAC]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: CMI8768 [C-Media CMI8768], device 2: CMI8738-MC8 [C-Media PCI IEC958]\n  Subdevices: 0/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 1: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: ALC888 Analog [ALC888 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 1: Intel [HDA Intel], device 1: ALC888 Digital [ALC888 Digital]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\n\nA: I have at least been able to get 2 out of 3 with the following set up. Both Stereo audio and passthrough work within XBMC without having to uninstall pulse. I still however have to select a different audio output from the ubuntu sound settings (i.e. internal audio):\nIn ~/.asoundrc:\n# ALSA library configuration file\n\n# Include settings that are under the control of asoundconf(1).\n# (To disable these settings, comment out this line.)\n</home/kbrandt/.asoundrc.asoundconf>\npcm.dmixer {\n    type dmix\n    ipc_key 1024\n    slave {\n        pcm \"hw:0,2\"\n        period_time 0\n        period_size 1024\n        buffer_size 8192\n        #periods 128\n        #rate 44100\n        rate 48000\n     }\n     bindings {\n        0 0\n        1 1\n     }\n}\n\nThen in XBMC:\n\nnote: The greyed out \"Custom Passthrough Device\" means that the option is not in use.

I am running apache2 2.2.14 on Ubuntu 10.04.  I have two virtual servers running, both using virtually the same conf script in sites-available.  One of the pages (robertsmetrology.krazycraig.com) renders super fast (1 second F5 on index.html), no problems at all.  The second (robertsmetrology2.krazycraig.com) takes forever to render (18 second F5 on index.html).  Contrary to the code, the fast loading site, being developed in Frontpage has lots of scripts to run.  The second, none, only HTML5 and CSS3.  I'm using zoneedit as my DNS server for both sites and the the Zone records are exactly the same.  I've looked at the access and error logs as well as messages, going as far as changing the apache2 LogLevel variable for the virtual servers to debug.  I've done a W3C validation and the only problems with the slow loading site are invalid meta tags and an & (instead of & amp;) in the href property of an anchor tag (e.g. href=\"http://whatever.com?a=1&b=2\").  And after fixing those the page render speed didn't change.  Both pages use the same images and text, the only real difference being the slow rendering page is HTML5, using tags such article, header and footer, and the other uses div and table formatting everywhere.\nI am stumped as to why one page renders so slow and it's contemporary so fast.  Can anyone point me in the right direction to debug this problem?\nThanks for your help.\nEDIT:  So I thought maybe there was something in the file that was causing the slow render.  To check this, I replaced my index.html with an index.html that looks like this...\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    test\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nStill it takes over 3 seconds to render.\n\nA: In Chromium or Chrome you can go to Developer Tools and select Network option to see how long it takes to load each resource. Typically when a page loads slowly it is because the browser is trying to access something that is either not found on the server or it is accessing content on a different server. \n\nA: I've seen an issue where apache2 will start queuing requests after it hits a maximum number of simultaneous connections. The issue happened only for one virtual host which had a lot of simultaneous connections.\nTo find out if you've reached this limit, first find out which MPM you are using by running this command:\napachectl -V\n\nCheck out what settings are available for your MPM and what they have been set to on your server. This may be in httpd.conf or a similar file depending on your setup. If nothing is set up for your MPM then you will be using the default values.\nNext, check the Apache documentation for the MPM you are using. For example, if you are running the worker MPM on apache 2.2, visit https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/worker.html . Read through the settings and see what the maximum number of simultaneous connections would be.\nIf mod_status is not enabled, try to enable it but make sure it is not accessible to the public. Replace your_ip_address with a whitelisted ip address or host name as desired. It will require a restart of apache.\n<Location /server-status>\nSetHandler server-status\nOrder deny,allow\nDeny from all\nAllow from your_ip_address_or_host_name\n</Location> \n\nThen when you visit http://your.server/server-status (may need https if you are using TLS) you will see how many requests are being processed simultaneously. If this is maxed out, then consider tuning your MPM settings to meet the demand on your server.\n", "Q: How to remake image of extracted files in usb? i extracted a ubuntu 12.04 amd64 in usb by startup disk creator and the original image is deleted when i install ubuntu 12.04 from usb now how can i remake iso image from usb without re download iso?\n\nA: \nYou can use dd for this. Make sure that your USB device is recognized\n  by the system as /dev/sdb. You should make sure that this is the case\n  before executing any of the commands below, because if you get the\n  device name wrong, the second command below will end up overwriting\n  the wrong device and destroying your data.\nTo make an image from your existing USB setup and write it to the file\n  usb-image.iso:\n\nJust press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\n\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=usb-image.iso\n\n\nAgain it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you make sure you're using the correct device name before executing the command above.

That being said, the biggest difference that comes to mind is that MPI was designed for distributed memory systems (like clusters) and OpenMP was designed for shared memory systems (like your PC).\n\nA: Even if not aimed specifically to OpenMP vs. MPI, I think that this thread answers to a good portion of your question. To be really brief, MPI is not a shared memory model and is targeted to very highly parallelized systems. OpenMP is a shared memory model (as simple pthreads) and one of its advantages is that the parallelization process is easier with respect to MPI. So it's harder to convert a serial program into a MPI parallelized version, but if you'd plan to run the program on thousands of nodes, you'll probably have better performance with MPI.\nAs a side note, I think that you posted on the wrong site. Stackoverflow is best suited for this kind of questions.\n", "Q: How to stop Banshee from converting my music to mp3? When I am synchronizing my music with Banshee, it stars converting my music into mp3.  \nHow can I stop Banshee to convert my music and make it just copying it?  \nMy player can play nearly every music format, so converting it takes a lot of time and resources.\n\nA: Aah, I found a solution.\nCreate a file named .is_audio_player and put it in the root of your Music-Player. (the . is important!)\nThen open this file (it is eventually hidden, go to the menu and allow to see hidden files) and write the following into the file:\noutput_formats=audio/ogg,audio/mp3,audio/m4a\n\nThis is the the solution. Here you can define, which formats you not want to have converted. For example if you want to have m4b not converted, add ,audio/m4b. \n", "Q: How do I open a .tar.gz magazine file to edit with Scribus? I downloaded a tar.gz file from Translate Full Circle\nfor translating this magazine in my native language, but i can't open it on Scribus(the software to edit any text files)\nplease help me i really wait for your help.\nthank you.\n\nA: A tar.gz is a compressed format, similar to .zip if you are familiar with that. Simply double-click on it, and it should open with archive manager, where you can extract the real files to somewhere else.

I've tried several text MimeTypes and \"text/*\", but none of them would work.\nDoes anyone know which MimeType I have to use in order for my launcher icon to accept text when hovering over it?\n\nA: You can't drag/drop arbitrary clipboard contents onto launchers. The MimeType entry in the .desktop file specifies what file and content types the application can open, for the MIME system, and is as I understand the code, not used by the drag and drop handling. However, rather, the content of the drop is simply passed as an argument to the program, and must be a URI or file path, replacing %u, %U, %f, or %F, as specified in the Desktop Entry Specification, here: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#exec-variables\n", "Q: Set default sound device output I own a pair of usb powered speakers, and I am having trouble finding how to set the usb speakers as the default output.

Now I wanted to upgrade though to Kernel 3.4, as it brings many improvements, especially in saving battery life (ie. Intel RC6)... at least from what I heard. \nWhile I had no issues installing the 3.4 Kernel under Ubuntu 12.04 and everything so far runs fine, Bumblebee causes issues under kernel 3.4. When trying to run commands like optirun, lsmod (or similar kernel tools) these just lock up and never return. The Bumblebee developers seem to refuse to help with mainline kernels (as seen here: https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bbswitch/issues/17 ). \nDoes anyone know, how to solve this issue? \nCould I solve this probably, by compiling the kernel and/or Bumblebee against the kernels sources myself and having a Ubuntu-like kernel? \nAny other idea that might help me to solve this myself, so I could profit from the 3.4 features and Optimus, would be very appreciated. \n\nA: The mainline kernels are problematic because those are built with an incompatible toolchain. If you want to have the newer 3.4 kernel in an easy way, grab the .deb files from Ubuntu+1 (Quantal):\n\n\n*\n\n*http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/linux-image-generic\n\n*http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/linux-headers-generic\nYou need the linux-image-<version>-generic and linux-headers-<version>-generic packages linked from the above pages.

You can find url in cups web interface. you can find full tutorial about printers in ubuntu on this page: Printers and Linux - How to find drivers, install, setup | Linux migration tutorials\n", "Q: Ubuntu One directory location on Windows Would it be appropriate to ask why Ubuntu One for Windows stopped using the HOME environment variable between v2 and v3? I'm talking about software design philosophy, security considerations, why it's such a high priority to deny us flexibility in setting up our Ubuntu One sync directory the way we want, etc. Not a support question, just curious. I'm not looking for opinions or speculation, I have those already -- just the software design philosophy for that sort of decision.\nI was using HOME as a way to fool Ubuntu One into using a directory on a more appropriate drive than USERPROFILE, and that's not working in v3.\nI could point out that Microsoft provides a very easy way to change the location of My Documents so it is outside of the USERPROFILE, e.g. on drive D:, and when this happens Ubuntu One is unable to monitor any folders there. This means that one of the directory trees on Windows that the user is by design allowed to use is being denied by Ubuntu One, so an answer like \"best practice says USERPROFILE is the best place for the user to put files\" is incorrect, at least when \"My Documents\" is somewhere else.\n\nA: The short answer is: it's dangerous to allow that, and it only worked by accident.\nWe had a few reports of users who had HOME set accidentally (because of other software) and had unexpected results because of it, and we were not testing it at all.\nAlso, currently Ubuntu One doesn't do any checks to see if you are syncing folders in a removable device. If that was the case and the device would be unmounted, you would experience sudden and complete data loss.\nOne of the coming features we have in our roadmap is supporting syncing arbitrary folders, inside or outside the user's profile, in a proper, secure and consistent way.\nIf you want, I can try to give you a personalized build that supports HOME, but you have to keep in mind that it will be untested, and I can't guarantee it will not do completely evil things to your data.\n\nA: I just installed ubuntu folder synchronization on windows. I run into the same problems as Agmenor. Sorry, but from a user perspective it seems to be a pretty strange design decision you took there. It least on windows.\nAll my project files reside on a subdirectory somewhere on drive D in a well structured directory tree. I would like to synchronize a remote folder provided by someone else with a local directory residing somewhere on drive D. This should be a pretty normal use case. Though synchronization of remote folders to my local hard disk is limited to \"C:\\Dokumente und Einstellungen\\Administrator\\Lokale Einstellungen\\Anwendungsdaten\\xdg\\ubuntuone\\shares\\ProjectName (SomeUserName, 4e23470f-7214-4ffa-c9db-9dd028c1b035)\". (The exact folder name has been changed in this text for data security reasons.) And there seems to be no way to change this. First, I am not working as administrator but as a local user. It is okay that the Ubuntu software runs as an administrator, nevertheless it should deal with user accounts accordingly. Second, I do not want to access important document somewhere deep in the directory tree. This isn't very intuitive and users will get problems with long file paths: Only about 80 characters remain to be used for files and directories, because most Windows APIs only support paths up to 254 characters and a lot of software will have trouble with larger paths. And third I do not want to have important documents been stored in an application settings folder. This increases user profiles dramatically and prevents them from proper synchronization with servers. Data should reside in areas of the file system that are dedicated to data.\nAll in all it seems a bit strange to lock the user into his home directory to avoid problems with removable media because for applications under Windows it is pretty easy to detect if a file resides on a removable media or on a fixed drive. I personally love Ubuntu but the service you provide here is not usable for me. It may work well in very special use cases but not the typical use cases that arise in daily use. Please think about these use cases and address these problems: I would love to work with Ubuntu in the future!\n", "Q: Software Center is stuck for Dropbox \"applying changes\" \nPossible Duplicate:\nDropbox install stuck at 99%, how do I fix it?

Does the Ubuntu Software Center keep a log of everything it has installed? So I could just parse this log to convert it into a script full of 'sudo apt-get instals' or something. And then the next time I install Ubuntu I could just this script to re-install everything.  \n\nA: Yes, It maintains a log in /var/log/apt/history.log. Older histories gets compressed as .gz files. It contains installation, upgrade and removal logs.\nFor keeping existing software backups you can use\ndpkg-repack to make .deb files out of installed files. Here.\n\nA: Yes it does.

After deleting the partition and updating grub (grub said everything was fine). I rebooted, only to be faced with grub rescue. After another install I've still got two ubuntu's. Someone please help....\n\nA: Did you use only update-grub2 after deleting the partition? If that is the case then after deleting another partition, try sudo grub-install /dev/sdx where sdx is the HDD where the current Ubuntu installation resides.e.g. sda if first hard disk. Then do a sudo update-grub2. In this way, you'll be sure that you are updating the grub from current installation and not the other one.\n\nA: Go CD or USB live, open Gparted and you will ave a complete table of your partitions,\nfrom there erase the partition you want to remove and expand to full disk the partition you want to keep.\nT be sure to not face again grub rescue type in terminal:\n\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdx\n\nwhere sdx stands for the name of your disk, example:\n\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nthen run:\n\nsudo update-grub\n\nand everything will be all fine.\n", "Q: How do I get Rythymbox Music Player to omit the Oracle Java JDK binary from the playlists? Rythymbox Music Player finds the Oracle Java JDK compressed file, which is a .bin and automatically puts it in a playlist.  If you delete the item from Rythymbox the file system is modified in that the JDK gets deleted.  This is very annoying because then I have to download the JDK again in order to keep it handy for server deployments.  I want to omit the JDK from the playlist but I want to keep the file.  How do I prevent this file from showing up in the playlist?\nEdit Note that the playlist is not merely a view of what can potentially be played. If you delete the file from the playlist, the file actually gets deleted from the file system which might not be what you want.\n\nA: Right click on a music file such as a .mp3. Select Properties and in the Open With tab change the default music player to Movie Player. Now when you double-click a similar file, it will not invoke Rythymbox and not have to assemble the Rythymbox playlist.\n", "Q: How to install webmin?

If you'd like to help decrease the lag between the upstream developer publishing a new version and the time it takes said version to get into the Ubuntu repositories then I encourage you to look at becoming a Ubuntu or Debian developer.\nAlso, for Debian at least, once the current version of the distro is released, only bugfixes are applied to the packages in the repositories, new features have to wait for the next release of the operating system (IIUC).  I don't know if Ubuntu operates in the same way but that's how it works for Debian and Ubuntu is based on Debian.\n\nA: You can add unofficial software sources like PPA's, to get more bleeding-edge software. The software you see in the Software Center is whatever is provided by the software sources you have enabled.\nSo this question isn't really about the Software Center itself, but instead about why the official software sources, enabled by default in Ubuntu, don't provide the latest and greatest versions of software as they come out.\nThis is because of Ubuntu's policy of maintaining a stable user experience, and predictable functionality, within a release. When an Ubuntu release comes out, updates are not released to add features, or even to fix minor bugs. Instead, they are released only to fix major bugs (or any security vulnerability).\nThere is a small exception to this for Long Term Support releases, to support new hardware, provided that doing so doesn't break any existing functionality.\nThe community documentation on Stable Release Updates explains this policy in detail, including its rationale.\n\nA: Process is really simple, at the moment of feature freeze in the devlopment of a release the software list is established, only stable versions of softwares at that moment are in , beta and new versions are out until next release.\nThat's for providing an experience as much stable as they can.\nIf you want to reach the newer version of an application before the next release you had to manage your ppa to accomplish that.\n", "Q: NVIDIA driver problem after updating to 12.04 As the title says I have problems with the driver after updating to 12.04.

Please make sure that the kernel and all NVIDIA driver components has the same version.\"\nIs there anyway I can fix this from the terminal?\n\nA: I had the same problem but the Ubuntu kernel version was 304.43 and my Nvidia driver version was 295.49. However, I solved it the same way.\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nthen after the process was complete...\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates-dev\n\nand then, after this process was complete I rebooted and everything worked perfectly!\n\nA: Looks like you didn't uninstall your previous driver version. This can happen because nvidia-current-dev is of version 295.40 and nvidia-current-updates-dev is of version 295.49 as reported. If you've installed the nVidia driver from Ubuntu's Additional Drivers dialogue, try sudo apt-get purge nvidia* then try reinstalling by sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates-dev then reboot. If you have used the .run file from nVidia's website then go to a console by pressing Alt+Ctrl+F1 and then run nvidia-xxx-pkg1.run --uninstall to remove the previous driver components. Now give a reboot and see if that works. If not, then execute sudo echo \"blacklist nouveau\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf so that the default nouveau driver for nVidia chipsets are not loaded instead of proprietary one. Finally install packaged binary drivers by sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates-dev.\n\nA: I searched so much to find this solution.\nI had driver version 295.40.

All I want to do is get Ubuntu onto a brand new hard drive.\n\nA: Did you MD5 test the .iso image that you used to create the USB flash drive? If not, you should do that now, and see if it was corrupted (e.g., during download).

Now what I would like to do is to give a try with Windows 8 w/o having to make an USB bootable or anything like that.\nIs there a way to install Windows once Ubuntu is on the machine? \n\nA: You will have to boot from Windows install media to install it on the hardware. You can install it in a VM without having to boot off any special media, but you won't be able to boot directly into it either. I wouldn't recommend trying to install Windows to real hardware, from within a VM though. It is very easy to break everything in that case.\nAlso, you will need to be aware that installing Windows after Ubuntu, will make it difficult to boot into Ubuntu, as it will overwrite the boot record on the primary drive. Also, Windows is very picky and tends to require that it be installed on the first drive, in case you were planning to install it on a second drive.\n\nA: If your Ubuntu installation used up all the disk space then no, it can't be done, because you'd need to boot off a USB or CD in order to resize your Ubuntu partition (can't resize when you boot from the hard disk as the partition is in use).\nIf you can boot off USB or CD, then\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Live USB or CD, launch gparted and shrink your Ubuntu partition, leaving enough space to install Windows. I'm unsure of Windows 8's HD space requirements.\n\n*Follow instructions here for \"installing Windows after Ubuntu\". The thing to keep in mind is that Windows needs to be installed in the free space you have, ask it to leave the Ubuntu partition alone, and Windows will most likely clobber Ubuntu's bootloader, so you need to reinstall Grub2 for it to work again.\n\nA: In all honesty, installing to a USB drive is very inexpensive, can be done on USB 2.0 (although obviously 3.0 is better), and has the additional benefit of sandboxing so you don't mess up your Ubuntu system with dual-boot or any of that nonsense.\nThe process of creating a Windows 8 live USB installation is very simple and can be done on a drive as small as 4 GB. For the purpose of testing, USB 2.0 should suffice. Hope this helped!\n", "Q: USB boot with no windows? I fried my computer trying to load Alpine Linux.   Now I can't do anything.\nI have Ubuntu. iso on a USB, is that all I need?\nHow do I run it from BOOT: prompt?\nI think I formatted my drive and deleted my Windows Recovery disc too!\n\nA: Simply placing the .iso on the USB drive is not enough. If you intend on booting from USB you will need to do two things - you will need to change your BIOS settings to allow booting from USB and you will need to make the drive bootable. If you have another computer available I suggest using UNetBootin to create a bootable USB drive with your preferred flavor of Linux\n", "Q: Audio / Video Options disabled in Pidgin when using Yahoo Voice Video Please help me rightly configure my pidgin to enable yahoo voice/video.\nPidgin version 2.10.3\nConversation > Media > Audio / Video Options are disabled :(\n\nA: Unfortunately Pidgin does not support voice/video for Yahoo! Messenger. This feature has been requested years ago but has still not been implemented.\nAnother application, GYachI, does have this functionality, so you might consider using that if you need to use Yahoo!'s instant messaging service for voice and video chat. Or you could use a different protocol/service for this that is supported in Pidgin.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't look like GYachI has been maintained much recently. So you may or may not get it to work either. If you're running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, you can install it with this PPA. (Read this first though, so you understand the risks of PPA's and how to judge whether or not a PPA is safe.) Otherwise, you'll have to build the program from source. To do this, download the source code by choosing the source code option on the GYachI downloads page. If you don't know how to build a program from source on Ubuntu, see this guide and/or this guide.\n\nA: From Pidgin's FAQ:\n\nDoes Pidgin support voice or video? Yes, Pidgin does support voice and video, but this is limited to Unix-like platforms and the\n  XMPP protocol (including GoogleTalk).\n\nYahoo uses its own protocol, so the answer to your question is that, unfortunately, you can't enable Yahoo voice and video chat with Pidgin for the simple reason that it's not implemented for now.\n", "Q: When I launch Ubuntu it just has a purple screen? It goes to a purple screen then black, and doesn't do anything. I am using 12.04 WUBI on my laptop. I'm new to ubuntu so I don't know what to do\n\nA: This fooled me the first time I installed WUBI and it frustrated me for a week. After the screen goes black get a flashlight and shine it an angle at the center of the screen. If you can see the Ubuntu logo it just means that your computer's brightness is low. I tried nomodeset, grub editing, external displays and when I got frustrated I banged the keyboard accidentally hitting the brightness and it worked.\n\nA: It could one of a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's possible that WUBI is just taking a long time to boot.  My P4 laptop running at 3GHz took a LONG time to get past the purple screen (~10 minutes).  I knew it wasn't completely dead because the hard drive light was on pretty solid.\n\n*Alternatively it could be hung in the boot process.  Try hitting the ESC key and see if any errors are reported during boot-up.\n\n*Make sure you shut Windows down correctly and it didn't leave the disk in an un-clean state.  Boot into windows and run \"chkdsk /r\" on the drive where WUBI was installed.\n\n*If none of those work, you might want to check out the Troubleshooting section of the Wubi Guide.\n\n", "Q: How do I run update-grub from a LiveCD? Okay, so I did something stupid.  I was trying to clean up my Grub entries, and accidentally removed all of my Linux kernels from Grub (they're still on the hard drive).  So now, obviously, Grub doesn't give me any way to boot into Ubuntu; I can boot into Windows just fine, but Ubuntu isn't even listed.\nSo I just want to run \"sudo upgrade-grub\" somehow to restore Ubuntu to the list.  I can boot from a LiveCD, but once there how do I run that command?  (My Ubuntu installation is on sda5, by the way.)\n\nA: In 2022, you probably have an EFI system that requires a couple more steps.\nBoot from a Live CD and open the terminal.\nMount the partition (e.g. /dev/sda5) with your original OS to /mnt:\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\n\nIn case you are using a SSD disk, the device name starts with nvme, e.g. /dev/nvme0n1.\nFind out which partition has the EFI system:\nfdisk -l /dev/sda | grep EFI\n# example output:\n# /dev/sda1           2048     309247    307200   150M EFI System\n\nMount the EFI system partition (e.g. /dev/sda1) to /mnt/boot/efi:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi\n\nInstall GRUB according to @basharat-sialvi's instructions:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\nFinally, reboot the system.\n\nA: Boot from a Live CD.\nHit Alt+Ctrl+T to open terminal and run following commands:\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\nInstall the GRUB2 boot loader:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\nThat’s /dev/sda — the hard disk itself, not the Ubuntu partition – /dev/sda5.\nUnmount the Ubuntu partition and restart the computer like so:\nsudo umount /dev/sda5 ; sudo reboot\nIf you have more than one OS installed, re-detect OSes like so:\nsudo update-grub\nThat’s it!\n\nA: Since you say your grub bootloader appears, but the menu is empty, I think you don't need to reinstall grub, but rather, as you ask, run update-grub. To achieve this, you can use a Live CD, mount the relevant partitions from your hard disk, chroot into the mounted directory, and run update-grub, which should work as if you were operating on the actual hard disk.\nBoot with your Live CD, selecting \"Try Ubuntu without installing\".\nOnce it boots, open a terminal (ctrl-alt-t) and mount your Ubuntu partition on /mnt. I'm assuming the Ubuntu partition is /dev/sda5, but you should determine this yourself. Let me know if you need help to do this:\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\n\nThen mount a few more directories that are needed:\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\n\nAlso, if you have a separate Ubuntu boot partition (pretty uncommon these days, but it may be the case):\nsudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/boot\n\nHow can you tell if you have a boot partition?\nOnce you have your Ubuntu partition mounted, open  /mnt/etc/fstab. If you see an entry for /boot, note which device it is pointing to (/dev/sda4 maybe?). This is the one you have to mount.\nOnce these are mounted, do chroot to start using the mounted directory as the root partition:\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nYou'll get a #/ prompt. First thing to do is confirm that you're using the correct /boot directory. Go to /boot/grub and look at the files there. There should be a bunch of .mod files and a grub.cfg file. If the directory is empty, don't continue, because it means this is NOT your actual boot directory. Look above to see how to determine if you need to mount an additional boot directory.\nOnce you've confirmed that /boot/ contains the correct files, meaning that it is the correct location, type:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis should rebuild your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file with the menu entries.\nThen exit the chroot:\nexit\n\nAt this point you may want to check that things were correctly updated. For this, cd /mnt/boot/grub and check that grub's files are there, there should be a bunch of .mod files and grub.cfg, the latter should have entries for your Ubuntu kernels. If you only see grub.cfg and no .mod files, it means that this is NOT the correct boot directory, look above for how to mount a separate boot partition.\nUnmount the filesystems:\nsudo umount /mnt/dev\nsudo umount /mnt/sys\nsudo umount /mnt/proc\nsudo umount /mnt/boot #Only if you mounted it earlier\nsudo umount /mnt/\n\nAnd then reboot, hopefully your Grub menu will be restored.\n\nA: My solution to that problem was:\n\n\n*\n\n*download supergrub2disk from\nhttp://www.supergrubdisk.org/category/download/supergrub2diskdownload/super-grub2-disk-stable/\n\n*put it on the pendrive\nhttp://www.supergrubdisk.org/put-super-grub2-disk-into-an-usb-pendrive-as-an-iso-image-from-windows/ \n\n*boot computer from pendrive with supergrub2disk on it \n\n*log in to your Ubuntu\n\n*get Boot-Repair for Ubuntu from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nMaybe it's not the fastest solution but for me it was the easiest one.\n\nA: This solution is the exact same as roadmr's answer except much easier.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into AntiX Live CD.\n\n*Menu>Applications>System Tools>Boot Repair\n\n*Select 'Repair GRUB Configuration file' (this option does run update-grub)\n\n*Select the drive/partition where /boot resides\n\n*Reboot when its finished.\n\n\nIn my particular case, 'Reinstall GRUB Bootloader' fixed it for me.. I have a dual-boot windows/linux setup.  I used Macrium 7 to create a clone of a drive to a file.  Then restore that file to a new drive.  After I restored it to the new drive, it would boot to a black screen with a blinking cursor in the upper left.\n\nA: The combined instructions of roadmr and Basharat Sialvi can be found here:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/88432/293759\nInstructions for chainloader and multiboot commands of Grub2 are at Community Help Wiki. \n\nA: Thanks for all the great help!  However, in the end nothing seemed to work, and since I had a separate /home partition, I was able to reinstall Ubuntu without losing any data.  I still have to reinstall programs and do some configuring, but everything seems good at this point.\n", "Q: Where did \"Open with\" (user defined command) go? I'm now using Ubuntu 12.04.\nIn earlier versions you could associate a filetype with a specific command (e.g. self-compiled binary) by selecting \"Open with\" in the file's properties and select the command by providing the file path manually if it wasn't already in the list of applications.\nIs this possibility gone?\nThe only way I found now is to create .desktop files and edit the mimetypes via an text editor.\n\nA: I think you are looking for an answer like this.

So I stupidly downloaded the 64-bit amd version and installed it on my system. \nEverything worked flawlessly. But my friend suggested it wasn't the supported version for my system since I'm running a dell xps 17 with i5. \nSo I installed the 32-bit version and, initially, all went smoother and faster than with the 64-bit version. But once I installed gnome 3.4 my life got a bit harder.\nI got system errors, my drivers from nvidia weren't supported, etc. I followed online advice, but it didn't help.\nMy question is if it is possible that the 64-bit amd version is better for my system?\n\nA: If you are having problems with video drivers on an XPS17, your main problem is that you have an optirun video card setup, as do I, where you have an onboard intel video card that sucks, and the optirun nvidia card, that you cannot enable without a plugin called bumblebee.  Your problem isn't gnome, your problem is that you cannot simply disable the intel card and use an nvidia driver; X doesn't like using two different drivers in one session, and you can't simply disable the intel one or you won't be able to boot.   Unless you can rig up two different X sessions, one with shitty intel card to boot up, and the second with nvidia drivers setup, the only way to run 3D is sudo apt-get install bumblebee, then call optirun app-to-run-with-3d.\nI would recommend setting up one user account to boot into the computer with, and a second account you can load to a different session.  So, you boot into Alt+Ctrl+F7 using intel+unity/whatever, and load up a new X session for a different user on Alt+Ctrl+F8 with nvidia+gnome 3.4. \nIf you choose the route of running multiple xservers, make sure to read up on xinit: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/xinit.1.html\n\nA: If your system is 64-bit (which it is), you were right to have tried that first. On the other hand, 32-bit will work on any machine.\n\nA: Your friend is an ... uh, uninformed and mistaken person. As already stated, the instruction set of an Intel Core i5 completely supports the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. In addition, it looks as though your Dell XPS 17 has 6 GB or more of memory so there is no real advantage to using the 32-bit version. The 64-bit would make better use of your computer's CPU.\nHowever, it is also true that the 32-bit version should also work on your system. So there is a question as to why you started seeing errors.\nCould you please provide more details about how your installed the different versions of Ubuntu. The safest way to do it would be to erase the 64-bit version and do a 'clean' install of the 32-bit version. Did you do this?\n", "Q: Accomplishment Viewer not displaying Ask Ubuntu badges I've downloaded the new Ubuntu Accomplishment viewer.

I am honestly confused beyond belief about my package that I have installed for FFMPEG. It is, according to Synaptic, version:\n4:0.8.1-1really0u1\n\nFor some reason, I feel like this is not the version that would come in the repositories and I feel like another PPA that I may have used installed a wrong version. I believe it was the VLC PPA for nightly builds.\nCan anyone who does not have this PPA on their system tell me what version of FFMPEG they are running?\n\nA: Yours is a PPA version, which is most probably similar to the official version.

Does anyone have a clue on how to fix this?\nThanks.\n\nA: For Pidgin, it has a setting specifying which browser to use when opening links. For me, this was set to Manual for some reason, and it became so 'over night'.\nYou can find and change this setting by opening the buddy list window, going to Tools > Preferences > Browser. There select Browser default to use the system default browser.\n\nA: Default applications are specified in All Settings -> Details -> Default Applications.\nIf default Web browser is set there to Chrome, but links from other programs are still being opened with previously set default browser, this might be either some sort of a caching issue of Gnome, or 3rd party application - in your case Pidgin.\nThis is a blind guess, but I think I would try to reboot, and if still no result, would purge Pidgin and then reinstall.\nAnother option would be to remove Opera. Since you already have your favorite browser, most likely you don't need the other one, unless you have a special reasons for that.\n\nA: I had similar case - chromium wanted as default browser, but want also keep opera installed. Evince kept opening links in Opera, even I set chromium as default browser with update-alternatives.

My mobile modem is a ZTE MF730M connected to the Three mobile network.  I had to connect the device to a Windows machine and register it with Three before it would work.  The first time you plug the modem in, it connects you to the Three website to allow you to register.  Once you have done that, you can access other websites.\nNext issue:  the device includes a bit of data, which holds Windows drivers and windows config stuff.  It looks to the host computer like a USB CD-ROM.  When you connect it to your Ubuntu machine, it automounts the \"CD\", which disables the modem.

I think the problem is that compiz doesn't work correctly across the RDP connection on account of it needing a 3D card.\nThere are some solutions out there that tell you to change the gnome-session information. Doing this will leave you with an account that, when you log in on the local computer, will have none of the nice effects from your 3D card.\nWhat I did to alleviate the problem was. On the Local Ubuntu computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user from > System Settings > User Accounts \n(with same permissions as your normal account. I just used \"username-rdp\" where \"username\" is your current username)\n\n*Make sure the user is activated by giving it a password in the User Accounts window.\n\n*log in with that new user account\n\n*go to the terminal and run:\necho \"gnome-session --session=ubuntu-2d\" > ~/.xsession\n\n\n*Restart the computer.\nThis should leave your computer in a state where your normal user is untouched and can still do 3D and Compiz. Your new user will work through the RDP connection and will be limited to the 2D Ubuntu session without harming your normal user. \nIf you don't care about 3D then just follow steps 4. and 5. and then use your normal user account over RDP.\n\nA: I always create a new user for remote desktop connectivity. This way your normal account settings will not be affected by changes in the .xsession settings.\nIn 12.04 for Gnome-Classic with no effects use:\necho \"gnome-session --session=gnome-fallback\" > ~/.xsession\n\n", "Q: VMWare Kernel Modules will not compile or update on Ubuntu 12.04 Kernel Module Update was required when opening VMWare client (vmplayer) then following error occurs.

I would like to know if logs such as /var/log/syslog and /var/log/messages begin their first loggings during the installation of the OS, or once the OS has already been installed and at the first normal boot?\n\nA: I believe the answer is yes (although see my notes towards the bottom of the answer after the quotation from the manpage), but I have no recent installations to confirm this.\nIf you are trying to debug an installation, in addition to the syslog and messages logs, ubiquity (the liveCD installer) will also also send logging output to these files:\n\n\n*\n\n*/var/log/installer/debug (debugging output)\n\n*/var/log/installer/dm (stands for display manager I believe, similar to Xorg.0.log)\n\n*/var/log/installer/version (the version of ubiquity)\n\n*/var/log/partman (logging from the partition manager)\n\n\nThese files will not be overwritten by more recent logging (as syslog and messages would), so they might be more useful in looking for installation errors.\nIf you require further detail you can also pass -d to ubiquity to enable verbose mode, as explained in the manpage:\n     -d, --debug\n       Run in debugging mode, sending verbose information to\n       /var/log/installer/debug that may be useful to developers.  (The\n       /var/log/syslog file is usually required in any case, along with\n       /var/log/partman in the case of problems related to partitioning.)\n       Note that passwords will be logged in debugging mode!\n\nTo to this, from a liveCD you can either press Alt+F2 and run ubiquity -d (this might need root privileges, in which case add a sudo) or open a terminal and run the same command.  The messages about the syslog and partman files being required might indicate that they are not created until after installation, but in this case you should be able to make the files/directories first using sudo mkdir and sudo nano.\nAnother possibility would be that the logging would be done to the liveCD's virtual filesystem's /var/log/syslog, in which case you could open it and copy the information to a permanent destination being rebooting out of the live session and into the new installation.\n", "Q: Search for a string recursively whilst in current directory I want to search all files recursively from the directory I am in for a particular string.\nI tried \ngrep -r -i my_string\n\nand I tried it in a test folder with two tiny files but it wouldn't find the string.\nAlso, is there any special way of defining \"contains\" rather than matching the whole word?\n\nA: Are you searching for a file name or a word inside a file? grep searches inside the files, which seems to be what you want.\ngrep uses regular expressions - in fact, that's what the \"re\" part stands for. So, it does not use the normal bash wildcards; that is, abc* would not find words starting with abc, it would find words starting with ab, then zero or more c's following. But yes, if you simply give it a pattern, it will find it anywhere, with no knowledge of whole words.  If you wanted to find whole words, you would need to create a regular expression to tell it that.\nBut, like most commands, you need to put the filename(s) at the end of the command, so your example would just sit there and wait for the filename.\nAs @plink said, use \ngrep -r -o -i \"your_string\" *\n\n(or *.*, or other filespec).  The errors can be ignored.  If you are getting a lot of errors, you can append 2>/dev/null to the end, which will redirect stderr to a null device. \n", "Q: How do I set up my online accounts? It used to be found in the System Settings in 11.10 but I guess it's been replaced by Privacy in 12.04. I tried to set it up by using the Contacts app but I accidentally closed the option to add my online accounts and now it's gone. I've tried uninstalling Contacts and then doing a clean up with Ubuntu Tweak but that doesn't seem to have done anything. How can I set up my online acounts?\n\nA: The Online Accounts panel doesn't appear if you are using Unity. In theory, you don't need it with stock Ubuntu 12.04. However, it is useful if you have installed Evolution Mail, Contacts or Documents.\nIn some of these applications, like Contacts, you can open the Online Accounts panel directly from their own menus. Otherwise, you can get to it in the following ways:\nIf you have System Settings open, close it. Open a terminal, and run the following command:\nenv XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME gnome-control-center online-accounts\n\nAlternatively, install GNOME Shell in Software Centre, log out, and log in again but choose the GNOME session before typing your password. (To choose a session from the login screen, click the cog icon to the top right of the password field). When you open System Settings from the user menu, you will see Online Accounts as one of the options.\n\nA: I think you are looking for Broadcast accounts.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal.\n\n*Type the following command:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/gnome-online-accounts-panel.desktop\n\n\n*Scroll down till you see the following:\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;\n\n\n*Change it to look like the following:\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity;\n\n\n*Click save. Then try searching accounts in the dash.\n\nA: To reenable contacts import window in the same state as it appears first time, you need dconf-tools:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Run:\ndconf-editor\n\n\n*Go here: org > gnome > Contacts, uncheck option \"did-initial-setup\".\n\n*Run:\ngnome-contacts\n\n", "Q: Cannot install rpm package on Ubuntu 11.10 -- needs libc.so.6 I am trying to install an odbc driver for vPostgres (Vmware's version for postgres) on Ubuntu 11.10 (64-bit).\nI have downloaded the rpm file of the installer (64-bit) and when I try to install the rpm using:\nrpm -ivh Vmware-vPostgres-client.rpm,   it shows me this error:\n\nerror: Failed dependencies:\n    libc.so.6()(64bit) is needed by VMware-vPostgres-client-1.0.1.1145-532311.x86_64\n    libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.2.5)(64bit) is needed by VMware-vPostgres-client-1.0.1.1145-532311.x86_64\n    libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.3)(64bit) is needed by VMware-vPostgres-client-1.0.1.1145-532311.x86_64\n    libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.3.3)(64bit) is needed by VMware-vPostgres-client-1.0.1.1145-532311.x86_64\n    libdl.so.2()(64bit) is needed by VMware-vPostgres-client-1.0.1.1145-532311.x86_64\n    libdl.so.2(GLIBC_2.2.5)(64bit) is needed by VMware-vPostgres-client-1.0.1.1145-532311.x86_64\n    libpthread.so.0()(64bit) is needed by VMware-vPostgres-client-1.0.1.1145-532311.x86_64\n    libpthread.so.0(GLIBC_2.2.5)(64bit) is needed by VMware-vPostgres-client-1.0.1.1145-532311.x86_64\n    libresolv.so.2()(64bit) is needed by VMware-vPostgres-client-1.0.1.1145-532311.x86_64\n    libresolv.so.2(GLIBC_2.2.5)(64bit) is needed by VMware-vPostgres-client-1.0.1.1145-532311.x86_64\n\nFew things I have tried:\nlocate libpthread.so.0 returns:\n\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0\n\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0\n\n/lib32/libpthread.so.0\n\nI get similar locations for all other files:\nlocate libc.so.6\n\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\n\n/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\n\n/lib32/libc.so.6\n\nand so on.\nI tried creating symlinks using:\n\nsudo ln -s lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\n /lib64/libc.so.6\n\nsudo ln -s lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\n /lib/libc.so.6\n\nsudo ln -s lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\n libc.so.6\n\nbut none of them worked.

Every time I set the screen brightness to 70%, it restored to 100% next time. I can't find a save button on the new power setting panel(I am sorry for I can not post a screenshot right now). Can anyone tell me how to save this setting? Thanks.\n\nA: Personally I prefer starting with the brightness I had the last time I used my computer. Here is how I got that functionality:\nFirst create a file to store your screen brightness between sessions:\n\ncd /etc/init.d\nsudo touch prev_brightness\nsudo chmod o+w prev_brightness\n\nThen create a script that stores your current screen brightness when shutting down into the file you created in the previous step:\n\nsudo touch save_screen_brightness\nsudo chmod +x save_screen_brightness\nsudo gedit save_screen_brightness\n\nPut this into the file you just opened:\n\n#!/bin/sh\ncat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness > /etc/init.d/prev_brightness\n\nNow we need to make the script run every time we shut down or reboot the computer:\n\nsudo ln -s /etc/init.d/save_screen_brightness /etc/rc0.d/K99save_screen_brightness\nsudo ln -s /etc/init.d/save_screen_brightness /etc/rc6.d/K99save_screen_brightness\n\nFinally we need to load the value we stored when starting the computer:\n\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nPut this, before exit 0, into the file you just opened:\n\ncat /etc/init.d/prev_brightness > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nThat's it!\n\nA: Using Ubuntu 12.10 the solution Hevilath gave didn't work for me.  No matter what I did with rc.local it wouldn't run.\nI tried to add   \necho 5 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nbefore the exit 0 and it was not being called.  I added some logging statements to /etc/rc.local and /etc/init.d/rc.local and nothing was being run at all.\nThis should be working because Upstart still runs the older System V scripts at the appropriate times for backwards compatibility.\nSo I read up on how to write an Upstart script from here.\nI figured since System V is on its way out, I should learn about Upstart.  \nI wrote a simple script to set the brightness on my two monitors and it works without issue.  \nCheck it out here.\nAll you have to do is copy the file into your /etc/init/ directory using sudo.  It should just work unless the brightness value is being echo'ed to the wrong file in case it is a simple change.\nHope this helps\n\nA: *\n\n*Check brightness levels by running this command as root: \ncat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness \n\n(my laptop max brightness is 20) \n\n*Set you screen brightness to minimum and check current level by evoking next command\ncat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness \n\n(my laptop min brightness level is 0;)\n\n*Edit /etc/rc.local and add before exit 0 the following line:\necho YOUR_VALUE > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nFrom now on this brightness level will be set every time you start your computer.  \n\nA: if you just wana change and save the screen brightness only, you can use xbacklight\n     sudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nafter installing, type command to set the screen brightness easily \n     xbacklight -set `num`\n\nthe num is percentage of your screen brightness.\nAn easier way to set brightness and contrast\n     sudo setpci -s `00:02.0` F4.B=`XX` \n\nto set brightness, 00:02.0 is your VGA device code.XX is hexadecimal form 00 to FF\nuse lspci command to find out your VGA device code.\n     xgamma -gamma `X`\n\nto set contrast,X from 0 to 1\n\nA: gksudo gedit /usr/local/bin/brightness_changer.py\n\nPaste below code,\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport dbus\nbus = dbus.SessionBus()\nproxy = bus.get_object('org.gnome.SettingsDaemon',\n                       '/org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power')\niface = dbus.Interface(proxy, dbus_interface='org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen')\niface.SetPercentage(70)\n\nSave it.

Not sure what I did to cause it, but I would login to my account and it would just immediately kick me back to the login screen. I could also login to the Guest account, but not my account. Finally, I had the same compiz errors in my .xsession-errors file. \nAfter reading this post: ubuntu 12.04 cannot login I decided to try renaming the .Xauthority, the .Xauthority-c and .Xauthority-l files so that X wouldn't recognize them. After that I was able to login. Checked my home directory and a new .Xauthority file was generated.

There is no option to boot Ubuntu.\nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS: Windows 7 Home Premium    \n\n*CPU: Intel i5 2500k    \n\n*mobo: ASUS P8Z68-V Pro    \n\n*GPU: GeForce GTX 570     \n\n*SSD: Corsair 120GB (Windows 7)    \n\n*HDD: WD 1TB   \n\n\nI select the USB drive in the BIOS and boot to it and choose install. I select to manually configure partitions, partition the 200 GB of unallocated space on my 1 TB HDD into 16 GB swap file, 30 GB / ext4, and 154 GB /home ext4. \nI made sure that the bootloader is installed on the Corsair 120GB SSD (where the Windows boot is) and the installation goes smoothly.\nWhen I reboot after the install it runs through the BIOS straight into Windows. I have tried upwards of a dozen times and I have also tried with Linux Mint. I have also redownloaded the ISO and used two different programs to create the live USB. \nThe installation seems to have gone well, as after the installation I can see the partitions I have created in Windows Device Manager.   \n\nI currently run Lubuntu on my laptop, but it is not a dual boot.

I just have no way of getting to it.\n\nUpdate: (copied from comment)\nI booted using my Ubuntu live USB and used the Boot-Repair tool suggested in virpara's answer. \nUpon opening the tool I saw that it was recognizing my SSD as a removable drive and defaulting to install on the HDD.

It is done through GUI tool.\nBy the way I don't like to give link to answer but it doesn't worth just copy and paste it again and again.\n\nA: I also posted an answer to a question that's really similar to yours.\nIf you saw nothing after you chose the GRUB Entry that means your GRUB didn't install properly.\n", "Q: Disabling monitor reconfiguration when closing lid I often need to move my laptop from one working place to another. When I do this, there are two events Ubuntu responds to by changing the monitor set up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing/attaching the VGA cable\n\n*Closing/opening the lid of the laptop\n\n\nWhile removing the VGA cable gives me what I need (single screen, highest native resolution on the external screen if connected; otherwise highest resolution on the laptop), the laptop close/open lid response is not as good.\nEvery time I close or open the lid, Ubuntu reconfigures the monitor set up. When I close the lid now... the screen goes black for a few seconds and it switches to clone, with my laptop screen disabled. Reopening results in... briefly a black screen, then the external monitor being used as desktop extension.\nUpdate: Things changed a bit recently, the behaviour is more predictable now. Closing the lid switches to single display, opening to dual screen (not clone). My question is still accurate: see below.\nUbuntu thinks too much. My first and foremost question: Is there any way to let Ubuntu ignore lid close events?\nIdeally (or when there's no way to solve above question) I'd want to change how it deals with the screen reconfiguration. Why does Ubuntu toggle the screen configuration between external, clone and single display? Can't I just configure it to always use the external monitor, when present, in single screen mode?\nNote that similar questions have been asked before (most notably this one), but these have been closed perhaps wrongly.\nAny ideas are very welcome, I don't mind playing around a bit to see if something works.\n\nA: \nIs there any way to let Ubuntu ignore lid close events?\n\nLid events are triggered by the lidbtn file in /etc/acpi/events/, which contains two active lines:\n\nevent=button[ /]lid\naction=/etc/acpi/lid.sh -- comment this out with a # at the beginning\n\nYou can ignore lid open/close events by commenting out the second line with a # and then rebooting.\n\nI'd want to change how it deals with the screen reconfiguration.\n\nYou can look at and try to modify the file /etc/acpi/lid.sh and the functions/commands it references.\nBUT (BIG CAVEAT): If your laptop BIOS uses the lid close/open to switch the internal/external video out ports on/off, then this is beyond the OS ACPI event handler's powers.\n\nA: This behavior is a Gnome feature, and it is controlled by a dconf setting. You can change it via dconf-editor or directly using command line:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xrandr default-monitors-setup <value>\n\nThe description says following:\n\nSummary: Whether to turn off specific monitors after boot\n'clone' will display the same thing on all monitors, 'dock' will switch off the internal monitor, 'do-nothing' will use the default Xorg behaviour (extend the desktop in recent versions). The default, 'follow-lid', will choose between 'do-nothing' and 'dock' depending on whether the lid is (respectively) open or closed.\n\nSo, if you'd like to use only the external monitor when it is connected, use dock as <value>.\nIf you want both monitors to always work, no matter if lid is closed or not, use do-nothing. (I often closed the lid temporarily just so that it did not shine into my dark room, I didn't want all windows to migrate to external monitor.)\nAnd finally, if you want to use laptop screen but only when it is open, use follow-lid. (Use case: amount of free space on your desk varies, and sometimes you have to put the laptop behind your monitor instead of beside it.)\n\nA: \nCan't I just configure it to always use the external monitor, when present, in single screen mode?\n\nI can answer this part. I run ubuntu 17.10 on wayland. In the gnome-control-center -> device -> display, you can choose single display with only the $external_monitor enabled, then click on \"apply\". That generates a $HOME/.confg/monitors.xml file. The file fixes the display arragemment when the same $external_monitor is connected, and toggles on the internal monitor once it's disconnected. What's better, you can put the same monitors.xml in /var/lib/gdm3/.config/, in that case the same thing holds for GDM too.\n", "Q: Good Wecam recording software I've tried the Cheese one already, but it lags.

I was planning to change the Plymouth screen resolution(Blame Fglrx!).\nWhen I went to GRUB-Customizer(info for that), the screen resolution menu shows (as usual) 800x600, 1024x678, 600x400, and a bunch of other things.\nBut after I scrolled down, I saw weird screen resolutions like 1024x768 x8, 1280x1024 x16, 800x600 x24, etc.  Computer screens shape like a rectangle, not a cube, so what does those extra numbers mean?  Or is there a secret dimension in every computer screen that I ignored?\n\nA: It relates to the number of colors simultaneously shown\nThat \"third dimension\" is the bit-depth, or how many colors can be displayed simultaneously on the screen at that resolution.\n\n*\n\n*x8 = 8 bits or 256 colors\n\n*x16 = 16 bits or 65536 colors (also called \"65k\" or \"high color\")\n\n*x24 = 24 bits or 16777216 colors (also called \"16.7 million\" or \"true color\")\n\n*x32 = 32 bits or 4294967296 colors, or sometimes the same as 24-bits with 8 bits used for opacity/transparency (called \"alpha\")\n\nWhich should I choose?\nThe highest available. On most modern systems, that will be 24- or 32-bits. See the example below for why:\n\nExample\n\n*\n\n*24-bit\n\n\n\n*8-bit\n\n\nA: The third number is the color depth.  1024x768X24 means 1024x768 pixels with a color depth of 24 bits.  8 bit will give you a Windows 95 color scheme, 16 bit will give you a much wider range of colors.  24 bit will give you millions of colors.\n\nA: x24 stands for 24 bits equally distributed in RGB constituents.\nR:0-255 : 8 bits \nG:0-255 : 8 bits\nB:0-255 : 8 bits\nHence in this format the number of pixels of different color possible is 2^24\n", "Q: how can I enable wobbly windows without using CCSM I am using ubuntu12.04 and unity.\nConpiz config settings manager makes my unity desktop carsh easily, so I wonder how to enable wobbly windows effect without using CCSM?\nAs I know, in the ubuntu 11.04, ubuntu tweak 0.5 provide some compiz settings, \nHow do you enable wobbly windows in ubuntu 11.04 without using compiz?\nbut in the 12.04 and latest ubuntu tweak 0.7 doesn't have desktop tweak tool.\n\nA: Well I just did this thing and it worked for me.\nHere's the way:\n\n\n*\n\n*You must have gconf-editor, known as Configuration Editor to enable wobbly plugin without using CCSM.\n\n*Once you have it installed, browse to /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/.\n\n*Open active_plugins.

I've noticed that the en_AU locale is defaulting to 24 hour time, it should be 12 hour as this is most commonly used in Australia.\nHow can this be adjusted?\n\nA: The link Rohit provides has the answer, and it's a good one (I used it myself, and upvoted it). However, in the spirit of this, and particularly in case the link Rohit provided goes away, I'm going to write out the answer in full.\nNote: this should still be considered Rohit's answer; I'm just transferring it here for posterity.\nOne way to do what you want would be, as Mitch says, to change your locale to one that uses the time format that you would like. However, that may entail getting other changes that you aren't interested in (Rohit's article has more on this).\nMore selectively, you can create a custom locale definition file with the format you want, like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change directory to /usr/share/i18n/locales: cd /usr/share/i18n/locales\nThis directory contains locale files. The filenames are in the format <ll>_<CC> where ll is a language code (e.g. 'en' for English) and CC is a country code (e.g. US for the U.S. or AU for Australia). The idea is to customize the one you're already using (e.g. probably en_AU for the original poster - I'll use that as the example).\n\n*Copy the existing file to a new file (so that you don't lose the original settings):\nsudo cp en_AU en_AU_custom\nYou need to use sudo because it's a root-permissions file.\n\n*Check the manual for the date command to figure out exactly what format you want for your time display:\nman date\nThe manual says:\n%r     locale's 12-hour clock time (e.g., 11:11:04 PM)\nwhich I'll use for this example. To use a different format, just adapt the following instructions accordingly.\n\n*Convert your format text into Unicode. You can look up the Unicode equivalent for each character from a site like http://unicode-table.com/en/ , which tells us that % is <U0025> and r is <U0072>.\n\n*Edit your new file (the one you created in step 2) with your favourite editor (gedit in the example). It's still a root-permissions file, so you'll still need to use sudo:\nsudo gedit en_AU_custom\n\n*Find the section marked LC_TIME and within that, the line starting with t_fmt, which indicates the time format.\n\n*Change the format to the unicode equivalent of your preferred time format, being sure to put it in quotes. For this example, the line should look something like this:\nt_fmt \"<U0025><U0072>\"\nSave the file and exit your text editor.\nYou now have a custom locale in the file you created (en_AU_custom in the example above).\n\n*Compile your new locale file into a system-readable locale definition with the localedef command (being sure to substitute your own filename if you used a different one from the example):\nsudo localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_AU_custom en_AU.UTF-8@custom\n                   ↑        ↑            ↑                      \n                 charmap    your file    locale definition name\nNow the new custom locale is available to the system.\nNOTE: According to the documention of the LangpackMacros class in the macros.py file of the LanguageSelector distribution package (see /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/LanguageSelector/macros.py in your distribution), the locale filename has a standard format:\n- locale: Standard locale representation (e. g. pt_BR.UTF-8)\n           Format is: ll[_CC][.UTF-8][@variant]\nThanks to Andreas Storvik Strauman for pointing this out!\n\n*Configure the system to use the new custom locale:\na) edit the file /etc/environment:\nsudo gedit /etc/environment\nb) add (or, if one exists, modify) the line that defines which locale to use for time/date (the file you created in step 9):\nLC_TIME=\"en_AU.UTF-8@custom\"\nSave the file and exit your text editor.\n\n*Log out and back in to see your new format being applied.\nNote: You can use the same process to modify the date/time format (d_t_fmt), date format (d_fmt), am/pm format (am_pm), standard 12 hour notation (t_fmt_ampm), and many other locale settings.\n\nA: Got to the symbol at the bar at the top of your screen where the time is displayed and click.\nGo to 'Time and Date Settings' (or similar).\nA settings screen will pop up.\nChoose the 'Clock' tab.\nAlternatively go to System Settings, then Choose 'Time and Date' and then the 'Clock' tab. \nYou can now choose between 12 and 24 hour day.\n\nA: how to do it\nRestart as mentioned Customize using the above link.

This doesn't require indexing first, but searching through all your files takes a very long time so if you ever have to do this more than a couple of times for your whole disk, you should use an indexing search utility instead (like in this answer).\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T).\n\n*Change directory to the top of whatever you want to search. For example, to search everything in your home directory, do cd ~. To search everything on your machine, do cd /. To search everything in an external drive called DocDrive do cd /media/DocDrive. If a directory has spaces in its name, enclose it in quotes (e.g., cd '/media/Documents Drive'.\n\n*Run a recursive grep as follows:\ngrep -Rs 'word or phrase you are looking for' .\nAlternatively, you can skip step 2 and, instead of cding to the folder you want to look inside, replace the . in step 3 with the name of the folder you want to look inside.\nIf you want to search through all files including those you don't ordinarily have access to, you can run grep as root with sudo:\nsudo grep -Rs 'word or phrase you are looking for' .\n", "Q: change desktop file manager I have marlin set to my default file explorer , but when I open my desktop icons it still uses nautilus.\nIs there a way to make marlin manage the desktop instead of nautilus?\n\nA: There is an only way to fix this:\n- Marlin should be able to draw the desktop\n- Modify mimetypes in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list to call marlin instead of nautilus\nMarlin won't be drawing the desktop as it's a file manager and not a\ndesktop drawer\nBTW Elementary OS team has forked Marlin in a project known as Pantheon Files you can also check that out.

Is it possible to correct this?\n\n*On the login screen, before entering the password, whenever I move the mouse, it is kind of lagging/stuck. Only after entering the password and pressing Enter, it works normally.\nI think this may be because of the updated kernel.\nIf so, is it possible to downgrade the kernel to the previous one ?\nIf that is not the reason, what can be the problem?\n\nA: apt-get upgrade does not normally upgrade the kernel - you need apt-get dist-upgrade to do that.\nFirst, disable the boot splash/plymouth by editing /etc/default/grub and removing \"quiet splash\", changing this line to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\". This will better let you see any errors/warnings during the boot process.\nIn any case, it is simple enough to go back to the previous one and see if the problems go away -- at the grub selection menu, select \"Previous Linux Versions\" (screenshot 1) and then select the top entry (screenshot 2). Note that the exact kernel names may not be the same for you!\n\n\n\nA: As for the Plymouth problems, simply boot into a previous Linux Kernel version using Grub2. To fix the mouse errors in the login screen, you will have to install Ubuntu Tweak to change the GTK theme in LightDM that is causing much of the lag.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nOpen Ubuntu Tweak, go to Tweaks, Login Settings, Unlock, and choose 'Adwaita' as the GTK theme. Adwaita will probably need to be installed via the Software Center.

Thx for the support.\n\nA: Enable the driver using \"Additional Drivers\" GUI:\nThe Nvidia driver included in the Ubuntu repositories (version 295.33) should support your graphics card according to Nvidia (see picture below). You may enable the card using \"Additional Drivers\", also known as jockey, by hitting Alt+\nF2 typing gksudo jockey-gtk, entering your password when prompted and then enabling the Nvidia driver using the graphical interface (note that you will need to have your video card physically installed for jockey to detect it and offer the driver).\nTo learn more about how Ubuntu handles hardware drivers differently from Windows please see this Q&A.  Also please be aware that there is a bug so that System Settings will show Unknown for your graphics card even when it is correctly installed and working--you may safely ignore this (or see this Q&A for the workaround).\n\n(source)\nIf \"Additional Drivers\" doesn't work:\nIf for some reason you require the newest driver or \"Additional Drivers\"/jockey is not automatically detecting your card/installing your driver you can install it manually by:\n\n\n*\n\n*downloading the driver from Nvidia here for 64-bit systems and here for 32-bit systems\n\n*following the instructions in this post from Ubuntu Forums to install the driver (please note that it is important to follow these instructions carefully as installing the drivers manually requires some special steps)\n\n\nHope this helps and welcome to Ubuntu!\n\nA: In the system settings there is an program called \"additional drivers\" which is very simple, and should give you the ability to install the driver. As for Nvidia, I never had problems, amd is a completele different story(but since you got nvidia, ur fine). Did you uninstall the drivers you installed manually?!

I enjoy tinkering with the settings to try and slim down the build as much as possible.\nBut here is the problem: The version of the nVidia drivers in oneric is too low to support Linux 3.4 (see this bug: https://launchpad.net/bugs/993506)\nSo in order to use linux 3.4 on my computer, I have several options:\n1) Use the source code hack (moving a file from arm/ to x86/) (I'd rather not, as this may create problems later)\n2) Install the driver using nVidia's installer (Not really a good option as package conflicts would occur (e.g. warzone2100 won't install because the driver package isn't installed))\n3) Find some way of installing the ubuntu 295.53 package on this system (either by installing the package directly from the launchpad link, building the package or through backports (preferable))\nSo, I'm assuming #3 is the most correct way of doing it, and if so, what would be the best way then?\nPS: I'm not fussed about having it automatically update.\n\nA: I don't think you need to build the driver yourself, try use swat-x's ppa\nhttps://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates/?field.series_filter=oneiric\nin other words:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates \n\n*sudo apt-get update \n\n*sudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nA: 3 is the most appropriate option.\n\n\n*\n\n*Temporarily add precise source repo to sources.list\n\n*apt-get source 295.52-driver-package-whatever-that-is\n\n*Try to build with dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc\n\n*Succeed and get deb packages, or get dependency error messages, in which case attempt to resolve and goto 3.\n\n\nA: Add ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/q-lts-backport and ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates, update, install the kernel, manually load nvidia-current-updates_295.53-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb per izx ... done and done.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One file corruption I tar ~/Documents to create a backup and my .tgz file turns out to be about 683 MB.  I allow my Ubuntu One upload speed to be about 2.5 Mb/s.  The sync takes several hours.  My Power Management setting is \"never suspend\".  I might on some occasions reboot Ubuntu in the middle of the sync in order to switch to Windows to print a file since Ubuntu does not have a driver for my printer.  I get no complaints so this seems like a permissible operation.  After the sync completed I downloaded the file from the Ubuntu One website.  Strangely the file is now 619 MB and using the diff utility I can see a message that says the binary files are not identical.\nDouble-clicking the downloaded .tgz file opens the Archive Manager and I get this:\ngzip: stdin: unexpected end of file\ntar: Unexpected EOF in archive\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\n\nHow did this file get corrupted?  \n\nA: \nI might on some occasions reboot Ubuntu in the middle of the sync\n\nI think this will be the answer. Also, uploading a big file instead of a bunch of small files is more dangerous. I think you should drop the creating a compressed archive part, and just set Ubuntu One to synchronize your ~/Documents folder.\nAlternative solution\nI have read an issue in the comments to this question that the files should be revised between two occasions (version control). One way would be setting up a version control system, but that is a big amount of hassle for home usage.\nSo, if you wish to keep revisions of files, but to use a solution that does not compress the files, you can have a small file to create a copy of your Documents folder with an added timestamp, and let that folder (as the folder uncompressed) synced to Ubuntu One.\nBut if the size of the folder is big, this download causes too much write on the system (not very good for SSD-based storages) and increases latency. I'm not sure how Ubuntu One treates symbolical links, though... If symbolical links are treated as copies of the file (so the original content is uploaded, not the link inode), you can just create symlinks.\n\nA: I have had problems with 5-6 MB zip files being corrupted by Ubuntu One. I create a ZIP in Windows, add them to an Ubuntu One folder in Linux and download the zip on another Windows machine. Corrupt file.\nSo, instead, I copy the zip from the Ubuntu One folder to a USB stick and open the the zip on the second Windows machine and it's OK. So the difference is the upload to Ubuntu One (via the Ubuntu One software in Ubuntu) and the download from the Ubuntu One website, using Internet Explorer.\nThe problem has happened two times to me, with similar files involved.\nIn your case, does the web site report the size 619 MB or 683 MB? This could indicate if the problem is caused during upload or download. If it reports 683 MB, then maybe it's worth trying a different browser to download with.\n", "Q: Why are Ubuntu One files in the cloud not the same size as the original? I tar ~/Documents to create backups.  My .tgz files are approximately 700MB.  I have created three such files over the past 3 weeks and I used Ubuntu One to protect these from loss.  In all three cases, the file size reported on the Ubuntu One website does not agree with the file size reported by Nautilus.  In all three cases, the file size in the cloud is several MB smaller than the one on the desktop file system. \nExample: My 2012 May 10 backup is 761MB but on the cloud it is 726MB.\nWhy is this happening?\n\nA: This is because Nautilus is showing you the file size in megabytes, while the Ubuntu One Web interface is showing you the file size in mibibytes. Compare:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 kilobyte = 1000 byte\n\n*1 megabyte = 1000 kilobytes\n\n*1 gigabyte = 1000 megabytes\n\n*...\n\n\nAnd:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 kibibyte = 1024 byte\n\n*1 kibibyte = 1024 kibibytes\n\n*1 gibibyte = 1024 mibibytes\n\n*...\n\n\nSo, in your example: 761 are megabytes, 726 are mibibytes:\n\n\n*\n\n*761 MB = 761 × 1000 kB = 761 × 1000 × 1000 B = 761'000'000 B\nNow let's convert 761'000'000 B to mibibytes:\n\n\n*\n\n*761'000'000 B = 761'000'000 ÷ 1024 KiB = 761'000'000 ÷ 1024 ÷ 1024 MiB ≈ 726 MiB\n\nAs you can see, the right symbol for mibibytes is not MB, but MiB. Unfortunately, mebibytes and related units have been defined just in recent times. Quoting Wikipedia:\n\nThe mebi- prefix was defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in December 1998.\n\nTherefore nowadays many people are used to write MB while they actually mean MiB. This is a common mistake that you will find in Ubuntu One and many other applications.\n\nA: The space allocated to files is determined by the cluster size for the formatted partition. Cluster size is highly variable in FAT32/FAT16/NTFS/EXT3/EXT4 file systems.  That why you will see a difference.\nIf I had 12 ounces of fluid and only 10 ounce cups then it would require two cups to hold the 10 ounces of fluid.\n20 ounces of storage space to hold 12 ounces.\n40 ounces would require 4 cups or 40 ounces of available storage space.\nComputers work in a similar way depending on the allocation unit sizes used on PC when it was formatted.\nLook at the properties of a 1kb .txt file where the file size would show 1kb but it would then also show how much storage space it requires due to the size of your allocation units. \nSource: computing.net\n\nA: Ubuntu One uses zlib to compress data before sending it, to save some bandwidth when doing the transfer. It also stores the file content in the compressed form on the server, to avoid having to recompress it before sending it back down the stream.\nThe answer has nothing to do with file system block sizes.\n", "Q: configure script throwing up gcc errors I'm trying to compile SDL-1.2.15 on Ubuntu 12.04\nhttp://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/multimedia/sdl.html\nThe install guide says that I need to start by calling the configure file.

You might have forgotten to clean up, so there's a stale a.out file belonging to root and not executable by unprivileged user.\nUpdate2: based on the comments below, I have to add another explanation to what happened. You tried to compile your package on a non-POSIX filesystem. Filesystems like FAT32 do not store file permissions, which is why you could not run ./configure and the script could not run a.out to check whether your compiler works.\n\nA: First install essential package.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nthen try\nIf you get error again then try this\nsudo ./configure\n", "Q: likewise-open with WIN AD or ldap-auth-client with openldap server I will like to know which of the following combinations is popular;\nlikewise-open with WIN AD or ldap-auth-client with openldap server\nThanks\n\nA: Both can be use as per your scenario.\nlikewise-open Can be use when you have centralised authentication with AD which server is on Windows.\nAnd ldap-auth-client is usable with Ldap.\nSo you can use it as per your scenario.\n", "Q: How do I revert updates/tweaks to get to a usable GUI? I just installed 12.04 the other day and then ran into trouble upon restarting after installing updates.\nWhat I did before the problem occurred:\nI did not make many changes before this problem occurred.  Changes I did make included:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloading and installing Adobe Flash Player  (off topic but: I am under the impression that Java, \"C&C\" and Shockwave can not be run in Ubuntu.  Could anybody verify this?)\n\n*I also installed gnome-tweak-tool and used it to install several themes.  These themes worked well until restarting after the update.  Is it possible that one of these themes caused the problem (in combination with the update or because of the restart)?\n\n*Installed 215 updates from update manager and restarted my system.\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nUnity 3D is unusable since restarting after running updates.  When I log in after entering my password the following things happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*the overhead panel disappears and the screen goes black for a minute\n\n*my wallpaper flashes for a couple seconds but then the screen goes black again\n\n*after another minute the wallpaper reappears but nothing else does and I am not able to open anything or even right click.\n\n*after 5 minutes I can finally get a right click menu\n\n*eventually a box comes up warning about a Compiz failure and asking to let it quit--which I did.\n\n\nUsing the right click functionality I was able to create a new folder on the desktop and use this to open a file browser.  In doing so I noticed that the downloads I had made were missing (music, image files, etc., even after unpacking several .zip and .rar files) even though I believe that everything should still be there.\nAny new windows that I create are un-closable/minimizable/movable/etc, because the window bars are missing.\nI have tried rebooting several times but the results are the same.\nI was able to browse some off the System Settings windows by clicking on the wallpaper link in the right click menu.\nIn doing so I navigated into the update manager and noticed that updates were selected to be accepted from some \"unsupported sources\".  I do not recall setting these options myself and wonder why these--potentially dangerous--options would be selected by default.\nUnity 2D is usable but not free of bugs--I stumbled across the ability to log into a Unity 2D session while trying to log into Unity 3D.\nSo far I have only noticed one bug in Unity 2D: the close, minimize and maximize buttons are invisible--however they are still usable despite being invisible.\nWhat I need:\nI'm very new to Linux and Ubuntu and still am in the feeling out stages.\nAs such I will have some trouble answering clarifying questions.\nI haven't used the terminal yet and would probably not be comfortable using it without very clear instructions. What I do need is to know how I can roll back/remove all those updates so I can use my computer regularly again.\nI do believe that I could follow step-by-step instructions as long as they are clear and concise if someone knows what my problem is.\n\nA: So something went obviously wrong during installation of updates. Ubuntu keeps, like Windows and other operating systems, log files for the actions it does. The program involved with the updates is called APT and there should be log files in /var/log/.\nYou can access these logs by pressing Alt+F2 and typing gedit /var/log/apt/history.log.

This might sound\nstrange and new to you, but this will remove the tool.\n\n\nIf this doesn't help and you want to start from scratch:\n\n\n*\n\n*be sure to backup your personal data and then\n\n*restart your computer (with the Ubuntu CD in the tray and your BIOS\nset to boot from CD).

What advantages does one have over the other.\n\nA: There are advantages and disadvantages of both cloning and a fresh install. \nIf a computer is running fine, there is no need to go to all the trouble of installing everything on new ones, you can just clone.\nCloning: Is a Fast, Easy Way to Set Up Multiple Computers.  Disadvantages of cloning, Propagating Existing Issues, Hardware Incompatibility Issues.  The advantages are, Extremely Short Downtime, and Simplicity.\nFresh install gives you a clean copy of the operating system, and gives you control over how to partition the drive.  Also you will have to install any software applications that you may need, and that can take a long time.\nNow, if you are using an SSD You should install fresh to make sure you get all of the benefits of the SSD.\nOn a personal note, I would choose a fresh install over cloning, just because I have control of what gets installed.\n\nA: Depending on what you are doing, you can clone an OEM install\nHow do I pre-install Ubuntu for someone (OEM install)?\nAt first boot, the new user is asked to configure the first (admin) user.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ubuntu_OEM_Installer_Overview\nCloning can also help if you have a custom install you wish to reproduce on similar hardware as it is going to be faster to deploy 1,000 clones on 1,000 laptops then manually install and configure the laptops post install.\nIMO, OEM/ cloning sort of makes sense if you are distributing the machines to others.\nAs pointed out by Mitch, a standard install is going to give you more flexibility (partitioning, encryption, encrypt home, etc).\nYou other option would be a custom live CD.\n", "Q: Can someone tell are there any bug fixes to skype on ubuntu 12.04?

I think I have Virtualbox set up so that all traffic originating from the guest OS is routed through Tor.

The host OS shows my real IP when going to the same sites.\nBut I initiate a lot of requests from the Linux command line and I haven't been able to confirm to my satisfaction that these are routing through Tor, though I have no reason to think they do not.\nWhen I use this command I get no output from the guest OS, but my real IP from the host OS:\ndig myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com +short\n\nThis bash file gives no output from either OS:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho Your external IP Address is:\nwget http://Www.whatismyip.com -O - -o /dev/null | grep '<TITLE>' |\\\n  sed -r 's/<TITLE>WhatIsMyIP\\.com \\- //g' | sed -r 's/<\\/TITLE>//g'\n\nexit 0\n\nSuggestions? \n\nA: Usually software which is called from your shell doesn't know about about Tor or any other proxy. So you have to tell it. The bad thing is that many software has specific ways to set a proxy up. Below you find some ways to get Tor working on commandline. I assume that you run a combination of Tor and Privoxy at the IP address 127.0.0.1 and port 8118. This might not true in your case. So you should enter the correct values.\nProxy environment variable\nThere is a special environment variable which is respected by some shell software.

I keep hearing about Nagios, a really powerful tool for monitoring servers. How do I install it?\n\nA: First of all, I'm assuming that you're doing this on a stock, brand-spanking new install of 12.04. Nothing special happening here. \nInstall nagios:\nsudo apt-get install -y nagios3\n\nIt will go through, and ask you about what mail server you want to use:\n\nPick one based upon your needs.\n\nIt will then ask you about the domain name you want to have email sent from. Again, fill that out based upon your needs.\nIt will ask you what password you want to use - put in a secure password. This is for the admin account nagiosadmin.\n\nAnd then you'll need to verify your password.\nOnce the install is all done, you can head over to localhost/nagios3 (or whatever the IP address/domain name of the server you installed it on is) and you'll be asked to enter your password:\n\nOnce you've done that, you're in!\n\nLittle ugly, huh?\nNagios automatically adds in the 'localhost' to the config, and does load, current users, disk space, http and ssh checks.\n\nNow there is one more thing we need to do before nagios is all ready - we need to have it accept external commands so we can acknowledge problems, add comments, etc.\nTo do that, we need to edit a few files. Start by opening /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg with the following command:\nsudo nano /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg\n\nSearch for check_external_commands, and turn the check_external_commands=0 into check_external_commands=1.\nNow, restart apache by running \nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nNot done yet! We need to edit /etc/group. There should be a line like this in there:\nnagios:x:114\n\nChange it to \nnagios:x:114:www-data\n\nSave and close this file.\nNow, we need to edit the /var/lib/nagios3/rw files permission with:\nsudo chmod g+x /var/lib/nagios3/rw\n\nAnd then (because of how permissions work) we need to edit the permissions of the directory above that with:\nsudo chmod g+x /var/lib/nagios3\n\nNow, restart nagios with:\nsudo service nagios3 restart\n\nIf you use Apache as your web server, restart that also:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nAnd you should be good to go!

If I switch on \"Auto-hide launcher\", it hides but does not reveal with the pointer, and only comes back on switching off auto-hide.\n\nA: Could it be this bug?\nInstall CompizConfig Settings Manager  and start CCSM. Edit Ubuntu Unity Plugin and inside the Experimental Tab set Launcher Reveal Pressure to \"1\" (instead of \"20\" - default).\n\nBut be aware: CCSM is an advanced tool. Use with caution. This tool allows you to deeply configure Compiz's settings. Some options may be incompatible with each other. Unless used with care, it is possible to be left with an unusable desktop.\n\nA: Thanks to \"Warrioring 64\". I found my solution in replies to BUG 9894477.\nLauncher reappears:-\n\n\n*\n\n*By pressing Alt+F1\n\n*By pressing super key.\n\n*By striking the left side with the pointer 3/4 times quickly.\n\n*By moving your pointer towards the left end and when you reach the left end, don't stop and just keep moving left (as if you're trying to push the mouse out of the screen).\n\n\nA: With Ubuntu 12.04, my launcher stopped revealing when I pushed my mouse to the left side of the screen. This happened after I changed several CompizConfig Settings Manager settings to completely resolve a \"sticky-edges\" problem among multiple displays.\nThe problem was that I had set the \"edge stop velocity\" to 1. After I returned this value to its default (65), my launcher behaved normally again. The edge stop velocity description reads, \"The maximum velocity at which the mouse will be stopped,\" so I think my launcher wasn't revealing because my pointer was always moving to fast to register as a \"stop\" on the left side of the screen. Whatever the reason, play with this value if the launcher isn't popping up and everything else seems normal.\n\nA: Go to System Setting --> Appearance --> Behavior\nNow you can enable/disable auto-hide and Reveal Sensitivity.\n\nA: I had this problem too.\nGo to System Settings > 'Appearance'.\nSelect the tab 'Behaviour' and switch OFF the fade out function.\nAlternatively adjust the sensibility of the reveal.

Click Settings... on the lower-left corner of the Update Manager window, to bring up the Software Sources window. Click the Other Software tab.

But they will not necessarily say that.\nFor each one, click on it and click Edit....\nIf the Distribution text box contains stable, leave it that way. This is how the Google Chrome software source currently works.\nIf you are doing this for a future versions of Chrome which might work differently, or for some other software, make sure the Distribution text box contains the codename (in all lower-case letters) of the Ubuntu release that you are currently running.\nIf you're not sure what that is, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the command lsb_release -c. That will tell you.\nThanks to Samik for pointing out that the current version of Google Chrome's software source does not use an Ubuntu release codename, but instead uses the general stable codename from Debian.\nIf the Comment text box contains just disabled on upgrade to _____, then you can go ahead and delete that text too.\nThen click OK. Make sure to do this for both Google Chrome software source entries.\nEnable these software sources by clicking the empty checkbox next to them.\nThen click Close to quit out of the Software Sources window.

I just decided to install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 7 on my Dell laptop. However I didn't do this manually but instead used the \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\" option during the installation. Now the partition that Ubuntu runs in has very little space and I am getting warning messages.\nI'm trying to use gparted 0.12.1-5 (via a live CD) to give Windows less space and give Ubuntu more. I've managed to remove 100GB from the Windows partition so I now have some unallocated space between Windows and Ubuntu.\nThis is what it looks like inside Ubuntu (not using the live CD, since it won't let me mount a USB to save a screenshot):\n\nSo first I take sda4 (extended?) and resize it to the left so it takes up all the unallocated space. Then I resize sda5 (ext4) as well so it takes up all the new space.\nHowever, when I hit apply, it fails on the first action (resizing sd4) with the error message can't have overlapping partitions.\nAny ideas as to why this happens? I also tried resizing sda4 by just a few MB so that it definitely didn't overlap anything, but I still got the same error message.\nTo clarify, I am using gparted from the LiveCD, I just took the screenshot from Ubuntu.\nI couldn't attach the details file containing the error information from gparted because I can't mount a USB drive when I'm running from the LiveCD.  \nI'm tried following the guide on the gparted website but it says Invalid argument or something like that. If the gparted details are needed, I may need some hints on how to solve the USB issue as well. :)\n\nA: The last post of this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1980664 solved the problem for me. \n\nWhen looking at the dialog box for \"resize/move dev/sda2\" there is an option to change the alignment from MiB to Cylinder - click to change it and... Voilà! To resize my sda1 (windows), I had to switch back to MiB. \n\n\nA: This problem appears to be the same as the following bug report:\nBug #678831 - Partition End Overlap when Resizing Extended Partition\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678831\nThis bug report is scheduled for inclusion in the upstream release of GParted 0.13.0 on Friday, July 13, 2012.\n\nA: Some suggestions.\n\n\n*\n\n*You are probably already doing this, but I'll mention it \"just in case\".\nBefore you attempt to resize /dev/sda4 (or any partition inside of it), you must use swapoff within gparted to ensure that the swap partition, /dev/sda6, is unlocked.\nIf you do not do this your LiveCD will automatically lock and use it. This would prevent you from changing it.\n\n*One way you could make a copy of the error results from gparted would be to copy the file onto your sda5, Ubuntu, partition.\nWhile using the LiveCD, open the file manager, mount the Ubuntu 2.87 GB partition by clicking on it, and then copy the gparted results file to sda5.\nFor example, you could copy the file into your /home/userid or /home/userid/Documents directory. After you have made a copy, change the permissions of the copy to allow anyone to read and write to it. (This will allow you to work with the file without using sudo, later, when you are not using the LiveCD.\n\n*Your swap partition is 5.9 GiB while your / (Ubuntu) partition is only 2.87 GiB. This is absurd.\nThe installer probably did this to you. It may have attempted to create a swap which was the same size as your memory. This is only important if you want to hibernate your machine. If you do not hibernate you can use a much smaller swap (or even no swap partition at all if you have 'enough' memory).\nI suggest you try the following using gparted after booting your LiveCD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure the swap partition is not locked. (See (1) above).\n\n*Delete the swap partition /dev/sda6.\n\n*Create a \"new\" swap partition no bigger than, say, 1 GiB (1024 MiB) at the END\nof the unallocated space inside sda4.\n\n*Resize your Ubuntu partition, sda5, to use the unallocated space now available in front of the new swap partition you created.  \n\n\nThe above steps should give you a few more GiB of breathing room for sda5 until you can figure out why you cannot expand sda4.\n", "Q: Overheating on VAIO SB36 I have Ubuntu 12.04 on my VAIO SB36 and it overheats and the fan speed is at max.

I downloaded the 10.04.4-dvd-amd64.iso file, then burned it to a DVD.\nI then tried installing it but it hangs at 95%. I then checked the hash with md5sum and they are not the same. The ISO is the same as listed on ubuntu.com.\nI burned the ISO using Brasero.\nThese are the hashes:\nubuntu-10.04.4-dvd-amd64.iso 4083424d0f0030e5480f2d183225616d\n/dev/dvd1 06631e0997be558620f613a0658331d9\n\n\nA: Please burn it again, this time setting the lowest possible speed (in Properties) and also turn the image checksum option on, if it isn't.\n\nA: Note: These apply only if you are trying to burn your DVD in Windows\n\nFor example:  Go to \"Device Manager\" > YOUR BURNER DRIVE > \"Properties\" > \"Details\" Tab > \"Property\" dropdown > \"Driver Key\"\nSee what it says, probably says the same thing as in your post.\n\nBecause the latter is associated with your DVD burner (e.g. go into devce manager and property of device and look at the device ID, etc.).  The device simply used its own language to write the disc while the first one was from another median or computer all together.\n\nSorry for the confusion in earlier posting.\nFirst download the Nullriver WinMD5Sum Software (install on Windows; there are other versions available also for Linux and Mac).\n\n\n*\n\n*Open program and select the Ubuntu image file and click open\n\n*Click the \"Calculate\" button\n\n*Go to this link and find the MD5 Hash associated with your image file version.\n\n*Copy the hash (only) from website \n\n*Paste the hash from website into the Nullriver software and click calculate.\nThe resulting information will tell you if the image you have is valid or if it's corrupted.  If it's corrupted find a new location to download from or select a different version to image all together.\n\nA: You can also get this error on a correctly written CD or DVD as the burning process can add a few sectors to the end of the burn. That's OK as they are never read in while using the CD.\nIf you have verified the checksum of the ISO you have written you can start a terminal session with Alt-Ctl-T and enter:\nls -ltr *.iso\n\nand determine the length of the iso in bytes. Then enter:\nlength=<length>\n\nand then (subsituting the name of the iso and the name of your optical device):\ncmp quantal-desktop-i386.iso /dev/sr0 -n $length\n\nIf there is no message the files are equal.\nor as an alternative:\ndd if=/dev/sr0 bs=512 count=$(($length/512)) | md5sum\n\nand check the checksum against the Ubuntu web site as you did with the .iso file.\nIf the checksum of the downloaded .iso file matched the Ubuntu web site, and if Ubuntu produced a valid checksum as it was burning the CD or DVD, it isn't necessary to worry about any of this.\n\nA: I've been looking for a burning program that gives the option of not using padding for a while. \nNot sure if xcdroaster used to, k3b did, not sure if it does now. You could try it. I can't use it anyway as I don't want polkit to have permissions on my systems and k3b via udisks can't find the devices without it, it's so clever it can't even look at device files when told.\nI even tried mounting an iso on /dev/loop for a copy but again the 'modern' or perhaps should be called inexperienced GUI programs wouldn't accept the device FILE and xfburn doesn't have a copy otherwise it would probably work.\nI was thinking of getting the old k3b version but the underlying programs have changed so much I'm not sure it would work.\nThe commandline tool xorriso didn't seem to like nopadding with the cdrecord option but cdrskin worked.\ncdrskin -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=as_needed -nopad speed=12 file.iso\n\nIt's so much better being able to verify the security and integrity in one go!\nThe caveat is the cd may not work with all devices as the padding is default for data to get around some driver bugs apparently. Never happened to me though.\n", "Q: How do I switch from Ubuntu to Ubuntu Server? I'm currently running Ubuntu 11.10 on a PC which can no longer handle the graphics (it's a dinosaur of sorts), and I now want to turn it into a home file server. To do so, I wanted to replace Ubuntu with Ubuntu Server, the command line-only one. How do I do this?\n\nA: You can use Ubuntu as a server, and you can install Gnome, KDE, etc onto Ubuntu server.  The difference is in the mix of applications installed.  So, you could use your existing system as a server without running the GUI shell, or you can install a different shell if you want a lightweight GUI, such as xfce or lxde.  I have an old Ubuntu 10.x system that I use as a server, and I rarely even log in directly, so it sits at the login prompt.  I mainly use ssh to log in, and if I need to log in directly, I have a choice between a virtual terminal or a gui shell.\nIf you really want the \"official\" Ubuntu Server, you will need to install it.  If you go that route, you might as well install a LTS release.  12.04 is the best choice, and Ubuntu has a good guide for setting up the server with LAMP apps, wikimedia if desired, etc.\nEdit:  Default Kernel Difference\nAs stated in the comment below, there are some differences in the default kernel for server and desktop editions.  There are certain optimizations that are turned on or off for Kernel vs desktop, although that information doesn't seem to be very prominent in the main documentation that I could find. There are differences in IRQ timing and scheduling, where the desktop kernel is optimized more for smoothness in the GUI, but is not good for higher-volume server systems.  But, it seems that 12.04 has stopped using different kernels for the two.\nAs stated below, the 12.04 32-bit version evidently comes with only the pae version of the kernel (pae is what allows 32-bit computers to access more than 3.2GB of RAM).  If your computer is very, very ancient, or a Pentium M machinge, it may not support pae.  On my system, they can be interchanged, but if your computer doesn't support pae, then there may be some issue with this.  I haven't see that mentioned in the documentation so far.\nIf you do want to install a server, the installation is different.  It uses a non-GUI install instead of the Live CD.\n", "Q: How to make Xbox joypad work with Bastion? I have an XBox joypad:\n\nBus 005 Device 004: ID 045e:0289 Microsoft Corp.

However, the up/down/left/right controls do not work and the button will not operate the menu. When I enter the control configuration, the joypad section is disabled and displays a message \"joypad not detected.\" If I enter the control customization and try to reconfigure one of the controls, noises can be heard when pressing joypad buttons, but the input is otherwise ignored.\n\nFurther information which may or may not be relevant:\n\n*\n\n*My controller is an original Xbox controller, not a 360 controller. XNA games on Windows apparently only work with Xbox360 controllers because they use xinput rather than direct input, see eg here.\n\n\n*My controller works (almost) properly with MonoGame trunk samples, but Bastion uses a modified MonoGame and crashes when run against trunk, so I can't add debugging to see where the problem is.\n\n\n*Bug can also be reproduced with a Xbox 360 wired controller.\n\nA: This is fixed in the latest package from the Software Centre.\n\nA: SuperGiant Games has not included joystick support for the linux release.

This answer supports all four current methods and probably future methods too.\nAnother advantage is this method has less complex control codes to traverse over in order to insert your changes.\n\nA: Run this code in the current terminal\nPROMPT_DIRTRIM=3\n\nNow the bash prompt will show only the last 3 directory names.\nYou can choose 1 to show only current directory.

I recently created a virtual windows xp with Virtual Box OSE. \nThe sound and video seem to be working just fine. However, it does not recognize the webcam which I use to video chat with yahoo messenger.\nI use Windows to have video chats with my daughters who live in another country. Since I did not want to go back to windows, I decided to try installing windows in a virtual machine.\nBut when I tried using it yesterday, everything worked perfectly except for the webcam. I was not able to make the webcam work. \nI tried to download  the drivers for it, but since my laptop is HP Pavilion g4-1287la, Core i3, none of the drivers I tried worked. I got the same error every time I tried to install them, something like: This driver cannot be installed in this machine\n\nA: Unfortunately, your laptop does not have XP drivers according to HP.  So I would recommend that you give cheese a try.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo apt-get install cheese\n\nOr you can install it using the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: Here are two possible alternatives.\n\nWhy not use your laptop's webcam in Ubuntu to video chat? \nYou have not said anything about what happens when you try to do this. Does it not work? If so, how does it fail? What have you tried to \"fix\" it?\n\nThe other way you might go is not really a solution, but rather a possible temporary workaround. \nInstall Windows 7 rather Windows XP into your virtual machine. If your webcam does not work immediately after you install Windows 7 then at least you will be able to install HP's Windows 7 drivers for your webcam.\nYou can install and use Windows 7 for up to 30 days before you will be required to provide a Windows 7 software key. If you intended to use Windows 7 more extensively then this would be a problem. However, if all you want to do is use Windows to video chat, then after 30 days you could simply delete and re-install Windows 7 in your virtual machine.\nNote that you should also install the VirtualBox Guest Additions for Windows. You may also need to perform the steps described in the question Takat referenced.\nI understand this not a particularly good solution. But it may be \"good enough\" until you can find a way to use your webcam to video chat directly from Ubuntu.\nIf HP did not provide you with install media for your laptop which you can use to install Windows 7 to your virtual machine, then another possibility is to download one of the DVD install images for Windows 7 Microsoft makes available via Digital River.

I reinstalled the grub just in case, found the right name for that libdjconsole0 in synaptic, purged it and had no problems ever since.\nWhy did I not have this issue when booting from normal hard drive previously and just getting it now - and whether this actually was the issue - I don't know.\nBefore trying to remove the problem package while in recovery console, I also went through mounting all items from fstab manually one by one. Maybe it has instilled confidence into mountall and it decided to do it by itself the next time :)\nI hope that this post is not entirely useless.\nPS: the increase in performance is really awesome.

At first I thought that it was the icon theme that just didn't have icons at that size, so I tried various other themes and they were all blurry too. Is it possible to go into Dconf-Editor or something like that to set the icon size to something larger? Thanks\n\n\nA: Making the icons clearer\nThe option that should makes icons larger doesn't work, probably because it's constrained by the overall Ubuntu font size setting, but here's how to make the icons less blurry (clearer).\n\n*\n\n*In /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/classicmenu_indicator/cmindicator.py, find this at or around line 97:\npixbuf.scale_simple(width, self.icon_size, gtk.gdk.INTERP_BILINEAR)\n\n\n*and change the last part to:\npixbuf.scale_simple(width, self.icon_size, gtk.gdk.INTERP_HYPER)\n\n\n*This uses a better algorithm for scaling to the icons to the smaller size, and they look better -- compare before (left) and after (right), at 500% magnification:\n\n", "Q: Is this fix for Avast Antivirus crashing safe to use?

Thanks.\n\nA: This does not look to be harmful. Basically, these changes seem to me as if they were meant to ensure, that every time you start your computer, the virtual RAM filesystem that is available in /dev/shm/ is resized to some great size, probably to ensure that some temporary files that are going to be stored there will fit. \nOn the other hand, I have no clue why would this possibly could lead to fixing application crashes. It will not do any harm, but I doubt this fix can help.\nAlso, I need to admit I am not sure whether these changes will have any effect on ubuntu machine. These changes modify init.d files, while Ubuntu has migrated long time ago to another startup system, called Upstart, and it is possible that not only they will not fix anything, but will simply have no result.\nAnyway, it's safe to try if you want to.\n\nA: I have just changed from Ubuntu 10.04 LTS which needed the same fix as shown in the first reply.

I setup the partitions using the \"Something else\" option - I left the first hard drive alone, and put a swap and a ext4 partition on the 2nd hard drive.  When it asked me where the bootable device was, I put the first hard drive.\nThe problem:\nNow that Ubuntu is installed and grub lets me pick which os to boot to, I boot to Ubuntu JUST FINE.  BUT when I go to the home folder and look at devices, the only drive showing is the 320 gb/old hard drive that windows was installed on.  I can not see the 2 TB hard drive anywhere.  This is strange because I setup the Ubuntu partition to be the 2 TB hard drive and I thought I installed Ubuntu on that partition.\nThank you for your time and patience :) \n\nA: Don't worry, there is nothing wrong with your installation. It is exactly the way Nautilus is supposed to display your file system.\nThe 320 GB drive represents another drive in addition to your Ubuntu drive. This drive can be mounted by clicking on it (but it may not be mounted by default). In addition to this drive only the mounted filesystem on your 2nd hard drive is shown (represented as folders).\nTo view all drives (/sda /sdb /sdc ...) and partitions (/sda1 /sda2 ... /sdb1 /sdb2 ...) in your system you may issue the following command in a terminal:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThis is how Nautilus displays my system of 4 drives:\n\n", "Q: nVidia GeForce Go 7600? can it ever run unity?

You can find the address on the printers touch screen display from the 'network' menu if you don't know it.\n\nOld answer, which concerned what to do if you entered the wrong IP address, however it is probably outdated and I suggest trying to rerun the Driver install tool and re-entering the ip address again when prompted.\nI think this is a case of only being stuck until you ask for help.  Soon after posting this I decided to check the ip addesses of the printer and scanner.  Sure enough I'd entered a different ip for each one somehow.  Since the printer worked and the scanner didn't, I made the assumption that the scanner had the wrong one.\nTo correct this I had to enter the following line at the command prompt:\nbrsaneconfig4 -r SCANNER\n\nThis command removed the scanner with the incorrect ip address.  Then I simply added it back again, making sure the ip address was right this time.\nbrsaneconfig4 -a name=SCANNER model=MFC-J825DW ip=192.168.3.3\n\nNote: You should probably set the scanner up to a fixed ip in the router, otherwise you may have problems later on when it gets assigned a different ip when the router is reset.\n", "Q: Where to find all program icons?

I was looking into htop and the only process having > 0.0% CPU (apart from htop itself) was /usr/lib/udisks/udisks-daemon. \nSo the questions are: What is this service? Do I need it? (Or when do I need it?) Why is it accessing the drives?\n\nA: Official package description for udisks:\n\nThe udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices, implemented via D-Bus. It handles operations such as querying, mounting,  unmounting, formatting, or detaching storage devices such as hard disks  or USB thumb drives.\nThis package also provides the udisks utility, which can be used to trigger these operations from the command line (if permitted by PolicyKit). External tools such as hdparm are used if available to implement extra operations, such as configuring disk spindown times.\nCreating or modifying file systems such as XFS, RAID, or LUKS encryption requires that the corresponding mkfs.* and admin tools are installed, such as dosfstools and mtools for VFAT, xfsprogs for XFS, or cryptsetup for LUKS.\n\n\n\nDo I need it?\n\nThis should be considered an essential package by almost everyone. The only time I would consider removing it is if I had a simple /dev/sdX CLI install on a machine where there was no need for udev -- i.e., the hardware never changes (which in practice almost always means a virtual machine, a VPS or a very very old machine).\n\nA: Here is another take on your second question about whether you need it: It depends on what your objectives are. If you want to learn about how your system works under the hood, you definitely do not need any udisks daemon. Not even on Ubuntu.\nI am speaking out of my own experience here. The world needs more people who are curious about what is going on under the hood. See my code on GitHub for reference.\n", "Q: Why doesn't htop display the same processes as top? I have a home server sometimes running at a high CPU usage rate of about 50 to 70 percents.\nIn htop, my favorite process manager, I can sort the processes by CPU usage, but often there isn't any process consuming more than 0 % CPU. On the other side, htop displays the whole CPU usage of the system which is about 50 percents, as said before.\nI guess that there is an easy explanation for this, but I don't know it.\nMaybe there are some hidden processes? But even running it as root doesn't show more processes.\nEDIT:\nI looked into top, which is showing (at least) two more processes:\n  230 root      20   0     0    0    0 R 37.4  0.0 107:06.59 md127_raid5                                          \n20403 root      35  15     0    0    0 D  9.6  0.0   2:45.78 md127_resync   \n\nSo my mdadm raid is currently resyncing, which has been confirmed when I displayed /proc/mdstat. (See first comment.)\nSo this turns the question in: \"Why doesn't htop display the same processes than top?\"\n\nA: \nWhy doesn't htop display the same processes than top?\n\nBecause htop hides kernel threads by default, while top doesn't. You can switch this option off in F2-settings in htop.\n\n*\n\n*Before:\n\n\n\n*Uncheck the Hide kernel threads setting, press Esc to leave screen instead of F10.\n\n\n\n*Notice the new number of kthr (kthreads) at the cursor, and all the new k... processes that have shown up. You can sort these by CPU, etc. as usual. Apart from the name (begins with a k, has a / towards the end), you can also identify kernel threads by their very low PIDs (notice the 1, 2, 3...17 in the screenshot?)\n\n", "Q: Can't access MAAS web interface I'm currently using a virtual machine to run ubuntu server.

Among other things, a \"persistant\" live installation cannot be properly upgraded.\nThat said, a persistant live install obviously shouldn't be giving you a blinking cursor at boot, but I do still think that doing a normal install will fix this because a normal installation will be using grub rather than syslinux as the bootloader.\nIf after doing a normal install to the USB drive you still get the same problem, or if you really for some reason do want to stick with a persistant Live install, please run boot info script http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/ and post the RESULTS.txt which it produces. \n", "Q: A2DP connection not shown in PulseAudio I'm trying to pipe the audio ouput to my Belkin Z73 bluetooth receiver but once connected and paired with the key 0000 the receiver doesn't show up in PulseAudio.

I had chromium from the app center then today amazon prime video stopped working. It told me to update Flash. So I uninstalled chromium and installed Google Chrome. Didn't work. Then I downloaded flash for ubuntu via apt. That one gave me a \"flash version isn't supported\" message. \nThe flash version was 11.\nNow I tried http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/flashplugin-installer\nIt worked, but right in the middle of the video, it popped the error message again.\nSorry we are unable to stream this video. This is likely because your Flash Player needs to be updated.\nSo I don't know what happened.\n\nA: This is probably not working in Google Chrome for Linux because of the limitations of the Pepper Flash as Google mentions on their support page:\n\nLinux users: Adobe Flash Player uses a cross-platform API, Pepper API\n(PPAPI), to run its plug-in in Chrome. You might notice some of the\nknown issues below specific to Linux Chrome:\n[...]\n\n*\n\n*Viewing Adobe Access (DRM) content is not supported, since Adobe does not support it on Linux.\n\n[...]\n\nI think it's very much likely that:\n\n*\n\n*Support for the older 11.2 Flash for Linux (using the regular API) has been dropped by Amazon.\n\n*Support for the DRM required in 11.7 in Chrome for Linux does not work because of the aforementioned limitations of it.\n\nThis makes Ubuntu fall between two stools in the support for watching DRM-enabled video.\n\nA: try opening this page. You will see a small box with the title version information. Furthermore, it will run a  short flash video as a test and tell you\n1) if your flash plugin does function properly\n2) the exact version of flash you have installed (good basis for further troubleshooting)\nEven though it is no solution directly, it might be helpful for you.\n\nA: I had this same problem on Ubuntu 12.04 using Chromium.  I fixed it my following the instructions on the adobe help page for installing Hardware Abstraction Layer module:\nPrerequisites for protected content playback\nFor Ubuntu 10.04 or later, ensure that the Hardware Abstraction Layer module is first installed using apt-get.\n(Watch carefully for “hal” install errors, as a damaged package install can continue to affect video playback.)\nsudo apt-get install hal\n\nAfter the \"libhal\" (HAL) library install completes, close the browser and clear the Adobe Access directories by executing the following shell commands:\ncd ~/.adobe/Flash_Player\nrm -rf NativeCache AssetCache APSPrivateData2\n\nNote:\nIf the Hardware Abstraction Layer module is missing, Flash Player still functions. However, it cannot play protected content that requires the Adobe Flash Access DRM (Digital Rights Management) module.\n\nA: On my 10.04 system, I ran Synaptic Package Manager, searched for flash and found a package called flashplugin-installer version 11.2.202.238ubuntu0.10.04.1.  Picking it for installation caused it to remove the earlier version of flash plugin that was for 64bit. However, this solved the issue for me.  I can now play prime instant videos.\n\nA: Sometimes when flash gets automatically updated, the newer version doesn't work for me like my previous one had. I couldn't find an easy way to downgrade, but here is one way that works for me when I use firefox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the previous working version of adobe from the flash player archives. From what I can tell, the 11.2.202.xxx versions are for Linux. The version I downloaded, 11.2.202.275, came in a compressed folder. When I extracted it, I saw that libflashplayer.so was inside.\n\n*I moved libflashplayer.so into ~/.mozilla/plugins/.\n\n*Restart firefox. Watch your videos.\n\n\nA: Another common problem with Flash, especially in 12.04, is \"Gnash\" that little bugger caused me numerous problems with flash. Just completely remove Gnash, and then download the flash plug-in from Adobe or the \"Software centre\".\nThe terminal way:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge gnash && sudo apt-get install adobe-flashplugin -y\n\nFor those whom don't know, removes Gnash and the configurations (with purge) then installs the latest version of flash. You may need to reboot afterwards (something I don't do very often if i'm honest).\nEdit You may need to reboot once Gnash is removed, sometimes it's configurations are active in the current session.\n\nA: Chrome has Flash support built into the browser. This is not like how Firefox uses flashplugin-installer/flashplugin-nonfree or adobe-flashplugin (which are separate from the browser, but utilized by the browser). The Ubunbu packaged plugin can use the HAL, whereas the built in plugin to chrome cannot.\n\nA: /.adobe/Flash_Player/* probably doesn't have the right permissions even if you re-install.  Try the following if you're stuck after all of the above:\nsudo apt-get purge flashplugin-installer ubuntu-restricted-extras\nsudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nClose Chromium and:\ncd ~/.adobe/Flash_Player\nrm -rf ./*\n\nOpen Chromium and try to play the troublesome video (it probably will not play yet) and then:\ncd ~/.adobe/Flash_Player\nchmod 777 *\n\nChances are that these last two commands are all you really need to do. The rest is only there for completeness.\n\nA: I am an Ubuntu newbie and tried various work arounds to do with flash not being installed, or not having an up to date version of chrome or chromium etc to get amazon music to work in Chrome and Chromium. In the end went to firefox and went to add ons> plug ins> ... set shockwave flash to always activate and now its running fine.\n\nA: Go to your Google chrome Add-on and search for adobe flash for Google chrome and install the right one for your browser. I think it has something to do with your browser.

I've been using Ubuntu for a while now and I love it, I wouldn't think of using another OS unless I can't fix this issue. \nThe install I'm on is only around a month and a half old. I'm running 12.04 64bit on a 8,1 MBP.\nUp until around 2 weeks ago everything was running smoothly. Around then applications started crashing and weird things started happening. At first I thought it was just certain applications. \nThe first thing to start giving me trouble was compiz. Occasionally compiz will stop decorating windows and lost many other functionalities. running compiz --replace fixes this, but I don't feel like doing it usually once a day. The other thing with this is that after running compiz --replace, my conky window gets lost somewhere and so I run killall conky && conky -c  .conkyrc.\nBut this isn't with just a couple applications, it seems like it is proliferating through my system.\nLast week fontforge started crashing while doing whatever task. So I ended up unable to finish what I was working on to completeness. Didn't find a fix.\nToday rhythmbox started crashing.

From what you've described, I'd certainly be looking at a hardware problem, such as a bad memory chip.  \nI would start with the Memtest86 bootable program, and let it run all the tests for a while.  You should have a copy at the Grub startup menu, I think.\nIf that doesn't show any problems, you should look at your Hard Disk drive.

How can I compile a .java file? \nWhat programs will I need? If I need the Java JDK I will also need help installing that. I'm very new to Ubuntu, so any program that I need to install I will need a tutorial on how to install them.\n\nA: You need to install a JDK, Java Development Kit. Ubuntu contains a metapackage default-jdk, which depends on currently prefered JDK. Now it is openjdk-6-jdk.\nTo compile a Java file to runnable .class file you can run\njavac filename.java\n\nand run it \njava file\n\nIt is the most simple use-case and mostly it doesn't work because java classes mostly depends on other java classes placed in libraries.\nSo you would probably like to use some more sophisticated solutions. Most text editors supports Java syntax highlighting, for example jEdit, kate or vim, but they don't solve your compilation issue.\nYou have another option - you can install a full featured Java IDE. Ubuntu comes with both main OpenSource Java IDEs - NetBeans and Eclipse.\n\nA: Just type sudo apt-get update, followed by sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk for a quick installation for java7, then you can play games with java :-)\nFor more detailed official Java documentation, please visit this link.\n\nA: OpenJDK works best for me. It's simple and I have never faced any problem with it. Just follow these simple steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*From Terminal install open jdk\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\n\n\n*Write a java program and save the file as filename.java \n\n*Now to compile use this command from the terminal \njavac filename.java\n\nIf everything works well then a new \"filename.class\" file should be created.\n\n*To run your program that you've just compiled type the command below in terminal:\njava filename\n\nNOTE\nYou can use any text editor (like gedit) , \nreplace the filename with watever name you want \nyou need to be on same directory as the \"present working directory\" (got by running pwd) while running the command from terminal.\n\nA: If for example your file is my_file.java:\nclass MyClass\n{\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n     {\n       System.out.println(\"Hello World\");\n     }\n}\n\nYou want to do:\njavac my_file.java\n\nand then\njava MyClass # The name of the class, not file\n\nHowever, it is a common convention to give classes and files the same name.\n\nA: To compile the file, open your terminal and type \njavac filename.java\n\nTo run the generated class file, use \njava filename\n\nBut to do this you need to have the Java JDK installed in your computer.

But i did not created swap volume for ubuntu. There are already 4 partitions on my hard drive ( one windows 7 , one system tools ( windows 7), one for ubuntu and one for common media storage(ntfs)). Therefore Gparted didn't allow me to create any further partition for swap volume.All it said to create an extended partition, but i do not know to do this.  I want to create a swap volume out of  common media storage. How can i accomplish this?\nAnd I'm completely new at Ubuntu , so can you suggest some good getting started tutorial for it?\n\nA: To create a fifth partition, you would have to remove one of your four existing primary partitions, create an extended partition (which is a container for logical partitions, so you can effectively have more than four partitions on a system with an MS-DOS type partition table), and recreate the partition you'd deleted as a logical partition inside the extended partition. You'd have to have somewhere to back up the partition you remove (or at least its contents). This is a big hassle, in some instances prohibitively so.\nTherefore, unless you need your Ubuntu system to support hibernation (which requires a swap partition), you should set it up to use a swap file instead. This performs just as well (provided your swap file is stored on an ext2, ext3, or ext4 partition, which it would be).\nThe following instructions are taken from the Swap FAQ in Ubuntu's community documentation. It is not an exact quote, since I have changed the formatting for internal consistency and for compatibility with AskUbuntu; I have also made a few tiny edits for clarity. This documentation is licensed under CC-BY-SA, which permits inclusion (with or without modification) into articles like this (which, as AskUbuntu.com content, is also made available under that license). It might make sense to edit this further for clarity (or other purposes), but if significant further modifications are made, it would be good to explicitly offer them for consideration \"upstream\" (so as to improve the original source also).\n\nFour-step Process to Add Swap File\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a file the size you want.\n\n*Formatting that file to create a swapping device.\n\n*Adding the swap to the running system.\n\n*Making the change permanent.\n\n\nINFO: This will not work on btrfs-filesystems at the moment. See man swapon. \nInstructions For Adding a 512 MiB Swap\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file 512 MiB size (or replace what with whatever size you want):\nWe will create a /mnt/512MiB.swap swap file and set the permissions so that users cannot read it directly.\nsudo fallocate -l 512m /mnt/512MiB.swap\nsudo chmod 600 /mnt/512MiB.swap\n\nfallocate length suffixes are: k, m, g, t, p, e (See man fallocate.)\nBy default your swap file may be created world readable. We set the 600 mode permissions in order to prevent users from being able to read potentially sensitive information from the swap file. \nIf fallocate fails with fallocate failed: Operation not supported as it currently does on my Maverick machine, you can do this the old way, again 512 MiB:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/512MiB.swap bs=1024 count=524288\nsudo chmod 600 /mnt/512MiB.swap\n\n\n*Format that file to create a swapping device:\nsudo mkswap /mnt/512MiB.swap\n\n\n*Add the swap to the running system:\nsudo swapon /mnt/512MiB.swap\n\nThe additional swap is now available and can be seen by cat /proc/meminfo.\n\n*Making the change permanent:\nEdit /etc/fstab:\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nAdd this line at the end of the file:\n/mnt/512MiB.swap  none  swap  sw  0 0\n\nSave.

Furthermore, gparted shows /dev/sda2 - but no other partitions - with a boot flag:\n\nWhat is going on here? I'd like to have only the entries for Ubuntu and one entry for Windows in my boot menu - how do I remove one of them?\n\nA: You are correct that Windows 7 puts it's \"boot\" partition on /dev/sda1 by default, but it is possible to get Win 7 to put the everything on its \"root\" partition too -- e.g. by installing to a pre-formatted NTFS partition.\nPerhaps you have tweaked Windows in the past such that the bootloader/bootable flag went on /dev/sda2? Can you successfully boot from both Windows entries?

Basically, I need to set up bridged networking that uses static ip (not dhcp) on an Ubuntu 12.04 host running KVM. I'm pretty new to this area of things and have seen a couple tutorials; but, what I've seen so far is pretty old stuff.\nI did create an /etc/network/interfaces file for that purpose which can be seen here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1020623/\nProblem is, it breaks name resolution on the host when I configure that setup on the system.

That any changes made to the file will be overwritten later.\nCan someone outline the way to set up bridged networking with static ip with 64 bit Ubuntu 12.04 server?\nThank you\n\nA: I'll will try to help you.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*After removing NetworkManager, edit /etc/resolv.conf and add in your nameserver. nameserver 192.168.0.1\n  \n\nThis means that, as you disabled NetworkManager, you will need to take care of the /etc/resolv.conf yourself. AFAIK this message on the /etc/resolv.conf is there because NetworkManager put it there, or something else put it there. If you're not using any kind of dhcp, You should not expect this file to be modified. I wouldn't care about this warning in your case.\nThe '192.168.0.1' should be your router's ip or the dns ip provided by your ISP. To test your DNS server before put in this file, you can use the nslookup command like that:\nnslookup somedomain.com 192.168.0.1\n\nWhere 192.168.0.1 is your expected DNS server.\n", "Q: Sound stopped working I ran through the troubleshooting at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting\nIt did not play the test sound, and it also does not play sounds during speaker-test.  It does play sounds when I adjust my volume on my computer (using pommed).  It worked just the other day, but this is the first time I've tested it since last night, when I put it to pm-suspend-hybrid and it half-woke up (the backlight came on, but it didn't fully wake up), then went back, then half-woke again, but was frozen like that.  I had to do a manual reboot of the machine when that happened.  Now my sound doesn't work, except for adjusting the volume (where the little \"beep\" sound plays).\nDuring the troubleshooting, it recognized my sound card, the sound modules, and the sound card's installation.  I've tried removing ~/.pulse, but to no avail.\nAlso, if it's any help, pulseaudio is running, but pulseaudio --check returns nothing, which the manpage suggests indicates an error.\nEdit: I should probably clarify that the wake up from the suspend-hybrid was not provoked in any way.  I was laying in bed when I noticed my room was brighter suddenly, so I got up to check on it.\n\nA: I seemed to have managed to fix it.  I don't quite understand what I did, because I cleared the cache before, but I guess when I tried to stop it beforehand, it didn't listen to me.

Look here. And then format the new partition with NTFS of FAT32. However, it is a good idea to boot with Ubuntu Live CD and then run sudo grub-install /dev/sdx(x=disk number in alphabetical order e.g. sda if you have one hard disk) and then sudo update-grub2 after you install Windows.\n\nA: Well if you want to create a partition that windows can read you should make a NTFS partition  \n\nAlso though windows cannot read ext2/ext3/ext4 there are tools meant to be installed on windows to do that.\nFor example see this tool Ext2Fsd Project\nthough it says ext2 it is for ext3 and ext4 as well.  \nAlso see this article for a few more tools.\nThree Ways To Access Linux Partitions (ext2/ext3) From Windows On Dual-Boot Systems \n\nComing to the partitioning part you can use Gparted as suggested by other answers.  \nFor a bit detailed (and a bit old but helpful) instructions with pictures see this article Partitioning.

Make Backups\nBefore we change partitions of our harddrives we need to make backups to be able to restore our data in case something goes wrong.\n2. Shrink an existing partition\nIn case we don't have an unpartitioned space on our drive we need to make some space for the new partition, else proceed with step 3:\n\n*\n\n*Boot a live session (\"Try Ubuntu\" from the installation CD)\nOnly unmounted partitions can be resized. We can not unmount or change a partition in use\n\n\n*Run GParted\nOpen the Dash and type GParted to run the graphical partitioner from the live session.\n\n\n*Select partition to shrink\nClick on the partition we want to shrink (take extra care that the partition is really the one we want to change). Then choose Resize/Move from the Partition menu:\n\n\n\n*Define size of the new partition\nIn the window that opens use the mouse to drag the right side of the partition to the desired size or give in appropriate values in the textboxes below:\n\n\n\n*Apply changes\nWe can now go further to step 3. below to create a new partition formatted as NTFS or we apply these changes to leave part of the disk unpartitioned:\n\n3. Create a new partition\nIn case we have an unpartitioned space on our disk we can partition ii with the disk utility or  run gparted  (we need to install it only when we are not running a live session) to select the unpartitioned space. From the right click menu choose New:\n\nSelect ntfs (or any other format) from the File System dropdown menu and optionally choose a sensible label for this partition. Click the green tick to proceed.\n\nWe can also use Gparted to delete an existing partition and overwrite this space with a new partition. This will erase all data on this partition.\n\n\nA: This is the official document by Ubuntu team on Dual Booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu .\nYou will find all the required step there .\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu have drivers for an IBM Thinkpad T40?

Just add a slash before the rest of the file path:\nnano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nIn the second, you need to add the Hadoop path:\nnano $HADOOP_HOME/conf/hadoop-env.sh\n\nAlso, you'll probably need to open them as root user, so add sudo before all the command (just like with gedit!):\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\nsudo nano $HADOOP_HOME/conf/hadoop-env.sh\n\n\nA: vi function in Ubuntu is different, you can install vim-nox or vim package\nSo after that you can try it for the same file\nuse following command\nsudo apt-get install vim-nox \n\nor \n sudo apt-get install vim\n\n\nA: The reason you are having an issue manipulating files is that you must have the appropriate level permissions in order to manipulate those files.\nSo, for example, if you want to manipulate /etc/apt/sources.list, that requires that you use sudo to temporarily elevate your permissions so you can edit the file. On your current user account, try:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nIf you are already part of the sudo group, then you will be asked for your password. Once you type in your password, your privileges will be temporarily escalated so you can edit the file and save it.\nIf you are not part of the sudo group, another user on the system who has sudo access can add you by doing:\nsudo usermod -a -G sudo your-user-name\n\nLearn more about Linux permissions here: https://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/309527-understanding-linux-file-permissions\n", "Q: Can I move the password field to the center of the login screen?

I would like to know is it possible to change the location of the password field in the login screen ?\n\nA: Options for 11.10\nThe layout of the login screen is controlled by the greeter package (plugin) for LightDM; the default with the left-side layout is unity-greeter. There's no way to modify unity-greeter to do what you want short of changing the source code, but it's easy to get centered layout with these alternative greeters if you don't mind the slightly simple design:\n1.

What can I do to optimise the data transfer speed from an external USB 3.0 docking? I have two HDDs inserted into the docking device, and I have it connected via only USB 3.0 on my laptop (blue colored one). I get rsync speeds of 50MB/s but I am not sure if this is the maximum speed I can get and how I could tweak it to optimal speed.\n\nA: \nYou should remember that the data is transferred to the destination,\n  only as fast it is being read off the source.\nUSB 2.0 has a maximum theoretical speed limit of 60 MB/s. Actually, it\n  is only today, 8 years after the launch of USB 2, that USB 2 devices\n  are able to fully exploit this speed.  Most of the USB 2 devices today\n  max out at 30-35 MB/s. The reason for this, the read-write speeds of\n  devices bottlenecks the transfer process.\nOf course USB 3.0 isn't all about speed. The new bus specification is\n  also intended to accommodate the next generation of power hungry\n  devices, gadgets and drives.  \nSo for USB 3, don't expect speeds of 400 MB/s plus; even though the\n  data could be transferred at that rate, it cannot be read off the\n  source HDD or written to the external drive at the same rate. Now if\n  you were to hook up a superfast SSD to the dock, & also had a similar\n  speed SSD in your system, then the transfer process would be\n  definitely faster, since both drives could read & write lighteningly\n  fast. So it is more likely that the transfers you are doing are\n  bottlenecked by the storage drives, in particularl, their sequential\n  read/write speeds; not due to the fault of USB 3.\n\nSource: tomshardware\n", "Q: Fullscreen Hulu in Firefox minimizes when I browse on another window I would like to browse on my main monitor while watching a full-screen video.

Simply go into your account settings and delete the stolen phone.\n\nA: The Ubuntu One mobile clients do not store your password on the phone: rather they store an OAuth access token that is used to authenticate as you to the Ubuntu One services.  This is stored on the phone's memory rather than the SIM, so you should probably consider it compromised the same as if it was on the SIM.\nYou can cancel this access token through the Ubuntu One web site at the following URL in the Devices section:\nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/account\nOnce you get a new phone, you should be able to sign in to the Ubuntu One client the same way you did on your previous phone and generate a new OAuth access token.\n", "Q: Why no library files installed for google test?

This option is revealed when you click the \"More\" button on the right.\n\nOnce clicked, it will provide an URL you can share with everybody. As far as I know this doesn't work for folders.\nOn your machine\nYou can even share a certain file from within your UbuntuOne-Folder. Right-click it and choose Ubuntu-One -> Publish.\nIn the same right-click menu the same menu you can Copy the URL to clipboard (for me this point is always greyed out, whether the file is published or not. It works anyways.)\n\n\nA: I would encourage Ubuntu One for this usage on condition you are very careful, because there are a few quirks. A file name without an extension will be given a .bin extension. Likewise if any file is downloaded with wget. If you rename a file in Ubuntu one without unpublishing it first, then the recipient will receive a file with the original name. And the files often get saved and named as the last part of the url which can be a problem if you download many files and wish to be able to tell them apart. On  my stock Android browser this is the case, though not in Chromium on Ubuntu, where Nautilus is able to save the file under its original name.

Unmount that partition:\nsudo umount /dev/sdd1\nMake sure you replaced /dev/sdd with the right device name for your device.\nsudo runs commands as root. You may be prompted for your password in the Terminal. As you enter it, you won't see any placeholder characters (like *). That's OK.

For example, if it's located in the Downloads folder in your home folder, you'd run this command:\ncd ~/Downloads\n\nThe ~ character, used this way, stands for your home folder (/home/username)\n\n*Use the dd command (running it as root, with sudo) to write the .iso image to the flash drive:\nsudo dd if=ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso of=/dev/sdd\nMake sure to replace ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso with the name of the .iso image you want to write (if different), and make sure to replace /dev/sdd with the device name of the drive you want to write it to. Please note that it is not correct to have a partition number in this device name (so it will look like /dev/sdd, not /dev/sdd1 as when you unmounted the volume).\nWriting the .iso image to the USB flash drive may take a while, and it typically won't show you any output in the Terminal while it's working, but when it's done, your USB flash drive should be bootable and suited for trying or installing Ubuntu.\nA reasonable alternative to steps 5 and 6 would be to type sudo dd if= into the Terminal, drag the icon for the .iso file from Nautilus (the file browser) into the Terminal (this will paste its full path), press Space, and then add of=/dev/sdd (or whatever the proper device name is).\nFinally, please remember that if you give of= the wrong device name, you can overwrite all or part of a drive that contains your valuable data. So be very careful about this.\n\nA: My experience with dd is that it only dumps the data to the flash drive. It does not help to make it bootable at all. I tried it with a flash drive I know is bootable and it would not boot from it. UNetbootin worked though--both the Windows and Ubuntu versions.\n", "Q: What is the Ubuntu Accomplishments project?

Is there a way to play audio over Bluetooth without any noticeable latency?\n\nA: Adaptive differential pulse code modulation involves a look-ahead type compressing algorithm where information cannot be transmitted before the encoder has had a chance to examine several bytes of forthcoming info. Hence, data has to stack up in the encoder, and there is an inherent time shift between the streams entering and leaving the encoder. Long ago, I did a study of data network delays to determine the feasibility of voice-over-data telephony (what is now VoIP).  I think I concluded that ADPCM-style compression/encoding would introduce too much delay. I think to overcome this Bluetooth-delay problem, one might need a non-compressing type of audio encoding which should have lower latency. \n\nA: No, this is not normal but I've had a similar problem occasionally with my Altec Lansing iMT525 Bluetooth Speakers. Something similar in concept to Sri's answer almost always works for me, and I need to do it only once per connect.\nAuto-switching Bluetooth profiles to re-initialize PulseAudio\nIf you're looking for a culprit, I'd look at Ubuntu's sound system, PulseAudio first, and then your Bluetooth receiver. Try this:\n\n*\n\n*First, delete and re-pair your Bluetooth device.\n\n\n*Then, copy and paste the below into a .sh file in your home directory, say /home/brillout/pabluezswitch.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nbluezcard=$(pactl list cards short | awk '/bluez/{print $2}')\npactl set-card-profile \"$bluezcard\" a2dp\npactl set-card-profile \"$bluezcard\" hsp\npactl set-card-profile \"$bluezcard\" a2dp\n\n\n\n*Make the file executable by opening a terminal and typing chmod +x ~/pabluezswitch.sh\n\n\n*Go to Settings...Keyboard...Shortcuts, and create a custom shortcut; name it whatever you want, with the command as /home/$USER/pabluezswitch.sh (substitute with the appropriate path). Click Apply, and then click on the right where it says Disabled to set up a keyboard shortcut to execute the script.\nWhat this does is force the PulseAudio system to resynchronize the audio being sent to your headset/speakers by switching profiles from ad2p -> hsp -> a2dp, thus hopefully getting rid of any latency.\n\nWhenever you connect and notice the lag, you should press the keyboard shortcut chosen above to attempt to fix the latency -- hopefully it works for you!\n\nA: *\n\n*Install pavucontrol: sudo apt install pavucontrol\n\n*Run pavucontrol from the menu\n\n*Go to Output Devices\n\n*Under the Bluetooth Device, open the Advanced menu\n\n\n*\n\n*There you can set the latency offset to the value in millisecond (plus or minus). To make sure of the value you need to put start with any value e.g., 250.00 ms.\n\n*Play any \"audio sync test\" from YouTube and set the playback speed to 0.25 (make it slower) and from there you can start noticing if the value is correct or needs to be increased or decreased.\n\n\n\nA: I get similar problem occasionally, irrespective of the player used. Mine is a Nokia BH-503 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone with MSI CR400 laptop and Ubuntu 11.10. I happened to come across a workaround which you can try. \n\n\n*\n\n*Start the video playback. \n\n*Go to Sound Settings > Hardware. \n\n*Select the Bluetooth device. \n\n*Then in Settings for the Selected Device drop-down, switch to Telephony Duplex (HSP/HFP) profile, then switch back to High Fidelity Playback (A2DP). \n\n\nA: I tried a lot of approaches to this problem, but nothing could fix it. Then I stumbled upon set-port-latency-offset\nIf you are using pulseaudio do :\npactl list cards short | egrep -o bluez.*[[:space:]]\n\nThis will give you the bluetooth interface.\nNow set the latency accordingly :\npactl set-port-latency-offset <INTERFACE> speaker-output 100000\n\nI am using 100000 microseconds which works fine for me.\n\nA: The top reply here works, but not for every Bluetooth audio device.  Some devices have different profile names than what that poster has with his Bluetooth speakers.  For instance, in the following code, which was originally posted by that person, it apparently has profiles named a2dp and hsp.  Neither of these are available with my LG Tones, for example, but they are with other devices like my Sony headset.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nBLUEZCARD=$(pactl list cards short | egrep -o bluez.*[[:space:]])\npactl set-card-profile $BLUEZCARD a2dp\npactl set-card-profile $BLUEZCARD hsp\npactl set-card-profile $BLUEZCARD a2dp\n\nThat code will work for most bluetooth devices it appears, but to get this working correctly for those devices that don't have the a2dp profile or the hsp profile, type in:\npactl list | grep -Pzo '.*bluez_card(.*\\n)*'\n\nThis will return everything after where it finds a bluetooth device.  For instance, with the LG Tone Ultra headset, I get this:\nName: bluez_card.B8_AD_3E_**_**_**\n    Driver: module-bluez5-device.c\n    Owner Module: 36\n    Properties:\n        device.description = \"LG HBS810\"\n        device.string = \"B8:AD:3E:**:**:**\"\n        device.api = \"bluez\"\n        device.class = \"sound\"\n        device.bus = \"bluetooth\"\n        device.form_factor = \"headset\"\n        bluez.path = \"/org/bluez/hci0/dev_B8_AD_3E_**_**_**\"\n        bluez.class = \"0x240404\"\n        bluez.alias = \"LG HBS810\"\n        device.icon_name = \"audio-headset-bluetooth\"\n        device.intended_roles = \"phone\"\n    Profiles:\n        a2dp_sink: High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink) (sinks: 1, sources: 0, priority: 10, available: yes)\n        headset_head_unit: Headset Head Unit (HSP/HFP) (sinks: 1, sources: 1, priority: 20, available: yes)\n        off: Off (sinks: 0, sources: 0, priority: 0, available: yes)\n    Active Profile: a2dp_sink\n    Ports:\n        headset-output: Headset (priority: 0, latency offset: 0 usec)\n            Part of profile(s): a2dp_sink, headset_head_unit\n        headset-input: Headset (priority: 0, latency offset: 0 usec)\n            Part of profile(s): headset_head_unit\n\nWe are interested in the profiles section.  In this section, we see three profiles, which are a2dp_sink, headset_head_unit, and off.  The two profiles we need should have in them (A2DP Sink) and (HSP/HFP).  In this case, they are a2dp_sink for the a2dp profile, and headsethead_unit for the hsp profile.  Notice this is different than the original poster's a2dp and hsp.\nNow, with the above code, we will modify it and put it into a file.  I called the file bluezswitch.sh.\nChange to the directory you want to put the file.  It can be anywhere.\ntouch bluezswitch.sh\n\nThen\nnano bluezswitch.sh\n\nCopy and paste the code at the very top of this comment and replace the a2dp and hsp with the values you got when you ran the above command, and paste it in that file.

Click Apply, and then click on the right where it says\nDisabled to set up a keyboard shortcut to execute the script.\n\nThat should be all there is to it.

Custom kernel compilation is not difficult, but system recovery and kernel debugging can be.  I am currently using the 3.4.4 kenel and abandoned the rt patcheset in favor of the bfs scheduler/CK patchset (thank you Con Kolivas).  Btw I believe the previous poster answer has a typo, timer interrupts of 100hz are generally for servers while rt audio is more realistic with 1000hz interrupts.  300hz is used for video production/editing.  Also be aware that your ideal choice of timer frequency depends on your processor.  Do you have one core or multiple cores? Are they virtual hyperthreaded or actual physical cores.  Unless you have hardware requiring the latest kernel revisions custom kernel compilation is probably not the best idea.  If you must have an 'rt' kernel try the 3.2 or 2.6.31-rt kernel available from Alessio Igor Abogani on launchpad.  The number of options in the current kernel is overwhelming and proper configuration can be tedious and time consuming.  Fine tuning of interrupts and proper system configuration is far more effective for achieving best possible latency.  \n", "Q: How do I replace the following missing files? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I figure out what package something is in without resorting to Google? \n\nI am getting the following errors with software center\n file does not exist: /usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/apt/__init__.py\n file does not exist: /usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/__init__.py\n file does not exist: /usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/view/__init__.py\n file does not exist: /usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/view/widgets/__init__.py\n\n\nA: Open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run this command:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall software-center\n\n", "Q: Run mysql queries in ubuntu 10.04 shell (cmd) stored in a files (desc order by filename) I have a folder with about 40 SQL scripts with varying names, \nAll using the pattern number description.sql.\nThe file number consist of 2 digits and goes from 01 to 40, not all numbers in this range included.\nI would like to iterate over this folder with files and run them via mysql cmd in a DESC filename order.\nHow can I run them all via mysql cmd in order of descending file number?

I'm running a 22-disk setup, 19 of those in a ZFS array, 15 of those backed by three port multipliers attached to SATA controllers driven by the sata_sil24 module. When running full speed (SATA2, 3 Gbps), the operation is pretty quirky. Simple read errors will throw an entire port multiplier into spasms for a long time, sometimes with pretty awful results. Booting with kernel parameter libata.force=1.5G to force SATA controllers into \"legacy\" speeds completely fixes all issues with the port multipliers. Thing is, my ZFS pool is backed by a fast cache SSD on my ICH10R controller. Another SSD on this same controller holds the system.\nDoing libata.force=1.5G immediately shaves about 100 MB/s off the transfer rate of my SSDs. For the root drive, that's not such a big deal, but for the ZFS cache SSD, it is. It effectively makes the entire zpool slower for sustained transfers than it would've been without the cache drive. Random access and fs tree lookups, of course still benefit. Listing the module options for sata_sil24, no such option exists.\nHow to pass the libata.force=1.5G parameter on to just the three SATA controllers being backed by the sata_sil24 module?\n\nA: Ah! I found out!\nAt http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt, it states,\n    libata.force=   [LIBATA] Force configurations.  The format is comma\n        separated list of \"[ID:]VAL\" where ID is\n        PORT[.DEVICE].  PORT and DEVICE are decimal numbers\n        matching port, link or device.  Basically, it matches\n        the ATA ID string printed on console by libata.  If\n        the whole ID part is omitted, the last PORT and DEVICE\n        values are used.  If ID hasn't been specified yet, the\n        configuration applies to all ports, links and devices.\n\n        If only DEVICE is omitted, the parameter applies to\n        the port and all links and devices behind it.  DEVICE\n        number of 0 either selects the first device or the\n        first fan-out link behind PMP device.  It does not\n        select the host link.  DEVICE number of 15 selects the\n        host link and device attached to it.\n\n        The VAL specifies the configuration to force.  As long\n        as there's no ambiguity shortcut notation is allowed.\n        For example, both 1.5 and 1.5G would work for 1.5Gbps.\n        The following configurations can be forced.\n\n        * Cable type: 40c, 80c, short40c, unk, ign or sata.\n          Any ID with matching PORT is used.\n\n        * SATA link speed limit: 1.5Gbps or 3.0Gbps.\n\n        * Transfer mode: pio[0-7], mwdma[0-4] and udma[0-7].\n          udma[/][16,25,33,44,66,100,133] notation is also\n          allowed.\n\n        * [no]ncq: Turn on or off NCQ.\n\n        * nohrst, nosrst, norst: suppress hard, soft\n                      and both resets.\n\n        * dump_id: dump IDENTIFY data.\n\n        If there are multiple matching configurations changing\n        the same attribute, the last one is used.\n\nSo, the tricky part is finding out which port X and device Y (dmesg ataX.YY) is which controller and drive. I think - that notation matches PORT[.DEVICE], but there's also the W:X:Y:Z notation. I'm guessing ataX.YY :)\nLuckily, I just did this mapping manually last week (trying to identify a drive that was throwing spasms and resetting a host controller), so I have an exhaustive list already :) I couldn't find anywhere that the mappings from sdX to ataX.Y or W:X:Y:Z where listed, so I ended up simply yanking out SATA cables and watching which ataX.YY messages appeared in /var/log/messages ;)\nSo, in my setup, it seems I need to do\nlibata.force=1:1.5G,2:1.5G,3:1.5G\n\nGonna have to try that out as soon as my ZFS scrub finishes, and report back :) Awesome! Hope this helps someone else :)\n", "Q: How do I download all the Proprietary drivers for offline use?

I'm new to UNIX, so I'm a bit confused by something that just happened. I accidentally typed \"suspend\" instead of \"pm-suspend\", and my root~#: prompt disappeared. Now, whatever I try to enter just gives me a line break, and pressing keys like esc, gives me ^[, the arrow keys are all something along the lines of ^[^[[D. What can I do to return to the normal shell prompt?\n\nA: suspend is a bash built-in command, what it does as per the man page is:\n suspend [-f]\n          Suspend  the execution of this shell until it receives a SIGCONT\n          signal.  A login shell cannot be suspended; the -f option can be\n          used to override this and force the suspension.  The return sta‐\n          tus is 0 unless the shell is a login shell and -f  is  not  sup‐\n          plied, or if job control is not enabled.\n\nThus your shell is suspended and will be until you send it a SIGCONT signal. The behavior you see is because the shell is not interpreting those characters.\nTo fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to another virtual console (press alt-F3 or something) and log in.\n\n*use pkill to send the CONT signal to all processes named bash.

What changes are already incorporated into 12.04 that will make SSD performance better by default. What changes are still needed to modify?\n\nA: I'm using a SSD drive for half an year now (OCZ Vertex II) and didn't configurated it in any way. It runs just like a charm. I was interested in this topic too and so i did a research back then. The conclusion was:\n\n\n*\n\n*What ever you do to speed up your SSD, you can't make it noticeable faster.\n\n*All these warnings on bad settings wearing out you SSD are negligible on newer SSD's and Operating Systems. More on SSD myths (especially on their endurance) here.\n\n\nSo, if you still have the feeling like somethings wrong with you SSD, use palimpsest disk utiliy.

When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nto locate the device name for the partition you are going to format.\nswap file must be turned off.\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nRemove swapfile:\nsudo rm -rf /swapfile\n\nTo create\nsudo mkswap /dev/sda5\n\nReplace sda5 with you device name.\nAt this point you get a new UUID. Use that to update your /etc/fstab file with the new UUID for your swap partition.\nAfter that:\nsudo swapon -a\n\nto tell Ubuntu to use the new swap partition.\nOr you can use gparted.  To install\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n\nA: First, confirm that gparted changed/updated the UUID of your swap partition.\nAfter the mountall: disconnected from Plymouth error appears, hit enter and you should get a logon prompt. Logon.\nFrom the command prompt, check the block ids of the partitions. sudo may or may not be needed:\nsudo blkid\n\nTake careful note of the UUID for the swap. Note that it will be exactly what's inside the double quotes, but that these quotes won't be used in the fstab file.\nNext, check what UUID is listed for the swap in fstab:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nIf it's different, carefully update the UUID to the new one that you wrote down. Ctrl+O to write out to file, after that press Enter so that the file will be saved to its current location, and Ctrl+X to exit. If there is anything extraneous in the fstab, you are likely to get a mountall: disconnected from Plymouth error..\nBy replacing the old UUID in fstab with the new one created by gparted, you can avoid having to delete the swap and recreate it from inside the OS, when you probably just did exactly that using GParted.\n\nA: In my case I just needed to remove an unnecessary device in /etc/fstab.\n\nA: After cloning a physical hard drive (physical, 250GB) to another one (physical, 250GB), I GParted the cloned in order to clone it to another smaller SSD device (128GB).\nRebooting on the 250 GB GParted to 128GB (swap moved, etc). I got a mountall : Disconnected from Plymouth.\nI don't understand how it could happen cause the system I cloned is a 10.04 Ubuntu server. (So I think there is no graphical so no Plymouth?)\nTrying to re-create swap failed at step sudo swapon -a resulted to an error on my fstab, the swap label for sda5 was the one of the old hard drive.\nChanging this label by the one on the line of sda1 remove the mountall error.\nHope it could help.\n\nA: Mitch answer is not working for me.

I tried this in both terminal and GParted(0.11.0-2 - the version in USC on 12.04) --  right click > format to > linux-swap, it shows the same error message.\nI have fixed this issue by simply delete my swap partition completely with GParted, reboot my system.

In other apps I installed (aside from the Ubuntu Software Centre), their installer asked to register the app with the system, thus allowing me to properly use them with Unity and dock them.\nHow can I manually register my app with the system? I don't want to just dock the app, I'd like for it to also show up in searches, just like a normal USC-installed app behaves. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n\nA: For it to be integrated in search, etc. the easiest way is to install alacarte. You can install it either from the Software Center, or with this command:\nsudo apt-get install alacarte\n\nAlacarte is the old menu editor used in earlier versions of Ubuntu. After it is installed, fire up alacarte, and make a menu item under the appropriate application menu (Programming for this example). It will now show up in your dash and you can pin it to your launcher like any other program.\n", "Q: VPN disconnected: resolv.conf not refreshed I connect to VPN using vpnc.

I tried a few commands that I'm posting here (my system is in spanish, so I have traslated it to english, maybe the terms are not accurate):\ngrep -i eth /var/log/syslog | tail\nJun  3 18:45:40 vanesa-pc NetworkManager[3584]: <info> (eth0): now managed\nJun  3 18:45:40 vanesa-pc NetworkManager[3584]: <info> (eth0): device state change: unmanaged -> unavailable (reason 'managed') [10 20 2]\nJun  3 18:45:40 vanesa-pc NetworkManager[3584]: <info> (eth0): bringing up device.\nJun  3 18:45:40 vanesa-pc NetworkManager[3584]: <info> (eth0): preparing device.\nJun  3 18:45:40 vanesa-pc kernel: [ 7351.845743] forcedeth 0000:00:0a.0: irq 41 for MSI/MSI-X\nJun  3 18:45:40 vanesa-pc kernel: [ 7351.845984] forcedeth 0000:00:0a.0: eth0: no link during initialization\nJun  3 18:45:40 vanesa-pc kernel: [ 7351.847103] ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth0: link is not ready\nJun  3 18:45:40 vanesa-pc NetworkManager[3584]: <info> (eth0): deactivating device (reason 'managed') [2]\nJun  3 18:45:40 vanesa-pc NetworkManager[3584]: <info> Added default wired connection 'Wired connection 1' for /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0a.0/net/eth0\nJun  3 18:45:40 vanesa-pc kernel: [ 7351.848817] ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth0: link is not ready\n\nifconfig -a\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  addressHW 00:1b:24:fc:a8:d1  \n          ACTIVE BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          Packages RX:0 errors:16 lost:0 overruns:0 frame:16\n          Packages TX:123 errors:0 lost:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          colissions:0 length.tailTX:1000 \n          Bytes RX:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:26335 (26.3 KB)\n          Interruption:41 Base address: 0x2000 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local loop  \n          Inet address:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          Inet6 address: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          ACTIVE LOOP WORKING  MTU:16436  Metrics:1\n          Packages RX:1550 errors:0 lost:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          Packages TX:1550 errors:0 lost:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          colissions:0 long.tailTX:0 \n          Bytes RX:125312 (125.3 KB)  TX bytes:125312 (125.3 KB)\n\niwconfig\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\nsudo lshw -C network\n  *-network               \n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: MCP67 Ethernet\n       manufacturer: NVIDIA Corporation\n       Physical id: a\n       bus information: pci@0000:00:0a.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: a2\n       series: 00:1b:24:fc:a8:d1\n       capacity: 100Mbit/s\n       width: 32 bits\n       clock: 66MHz\n       capacities: pm msi ht bus_master cap_list ethernet physical mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=forcedeth driverversion=0.64 latency=0 link=no maxlatency=20 mingnt=1 multicast=yes port=MII\n       resources: irq:41 memoria:f6288000-f6288fff ioport:30f8(size=8) memoria:f6289c00-f6289cff memoria:f6289800-f628980f\n\nlsmod\nModule                  Size  Used by\nusbhid                 41906  0 \nhid                    77367  1 usbhid\nrfcomm                 38139  0 \nparport_pc             32114  0 \nppdev                  12849  0 \nbnep                   17830  2 \nbluetooth             158438  10 rfcomm,bnep\nbinfmt_misc            17292  1 \njoydev                 17393  0 \nhp_wmi                 13652  0 \nsparse_keymap          13658  1 hp_wmi\nnouveau               708198  3 \nttm                    65344  1 nouveau\ndrm_kms_helper         45466  1 nouveau\ndrm                   197692  5 nouveau,ttm,drm_kms_helper\ni2c_algo_bit           13199  1 nouveau\npsmouse                87213  0 \nmxm_wmi                12859  1 nouveau\nserio_raw              13027  0 \nk8temp                 12905  0 \ni2c_nforce2            12906  0 \nwmi                    18744  2 hp_wmi,mxm_wmi\nvideo                  19068  1 nouveau\nmac_hid                13077  0 \nlp                     17455  0 \nparport                40930  3 parport_pc,ppdev,lp\nforcedeth              58096  0\n\nLet me know if I can give you more information.\n\nA: Managed to get mine going just now after upgrade to Ubuntu 12:\nEdited /etc/network/interfaces:\nThe line #iface eth0 inet dhcp was commented out; I removed the \"#\".\nThen I ran sudo ifup -a, and it brought up the network.\nSorry about the network manager, folks, but if there's one piece of software that should be 110% ready before a release, that would be it.\n\nA: I had a similar problem which was caused by a network-manager package update. I could solve it as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the previous version of the network-manager packet on a different computer from this page (scroll down and click on your cpu architecture).\n\n*Copy the file to your computer and install the package via sudo dpkg -i packagename.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*If this solves the network problem you can start synaptic, search for the network-manager packet, select it, go to \"Package\" in the menu and then click \"lock version\". Otherwise Ubuntu will try and update the package again.\n\nA: I had a similar problem: I have two laptops running 12.04 and one was suddenly unable to connect to the Internet.\nI recursively copied the directories /etc/network/ and /etc/NetworkManager/ from the working laptop to the other one via USB stick and restarted. I was still unable to connect with wired LAN, so I switched that off, turned on wireless and the connection worked. I switched back to wired and that was working too.\nNot the most elegant solution, and it requires access to a working Ubuntu machine, but it worked for me.\n", "Q: Gnome Shell installed not working in Ubuntu 12.04 I had Gnome Shell working perfectly on my desktop, and I tried to install it on my laptop by the exact same method, (tried apt-get, synaptic and software centre), but it won't work. It seems to install fine with no errors. If I select \"Gnome\" at login, I get the \"Gnome Classic\" interface rather than Gnome Shell. \nMy laptop has sufficient specs to run Gnome Shell. \nAm I missing something?\nEDIT: I have just discovered that under System > Details > Graphics, it says \"Unknown\". So, Ubuntu hasn't recognised my graphics card, and I'm guessing this is why Gnome Shell can't work. \nI have a nVidia GeForce GT 525M.\nHow can I get it working?\n(as you may have realised, I'm a linux noob)\n\nA: You may try opening the Additional Drivers tool in order to install the Nvidia drivers. If they are not installed, or Additional Drivers fails, open a terminal(Also under System) and type sudo apt-get install nvidia-current and allow it to finish. It won't let you paste the command, so type it, and press Y whan it asks if you want to continue.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my XPS 15 with a GeForce GT 540M\nMy solution came up when I followed this tutorial.\nSumming up, I just needed to upgrade my drivers with the new repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nA: http://www.filiwiese.com/installing-gnome-on-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/\nI had some other gnomeshell performance issue when I was using ubuntu 12.04 beta version; I just had a new installation yesterday, following the instruction linked above, gnome shell works better now. Seriously, why ubuntu doesn't use gnomeshell as default, on my netbook, gnome shell is much more responsive and intuitive than unity ...\n\nA: This is an NVidia driver issue however it is a little tricky to get it to function. I assure you it is there but there isn't any known fixes for this issue... yet. A workaround I had was to reboot PC then when it comes up hold the \"Shift\" key to get to the grub menu. Then choose \"recovery\" then after in the recovery you need to make sure the drivers are installed for the GC\n      settings>additional drivers\n\nOnce that is done then log off (NOT SHUTDOWN) then choose the gnome from the menu and log back in. Once this is done then restart the computer. \n\nA: According to https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-nv/+question/213879, you merely need to install mesa-utils.\nI don't know why the gnome-shell package does not list this as a dependency.  Will target bug #1091214 to address that point.\n", "Q: Korean symbols written ontop of each oher in Chromium I've got the really weird korean letters beeing written ontop of eachother, which is really disturbing as you can't read them anymore. In the picture you see what it looks and should look like.\nhttp://imgur.com/wmQhn\nThe \"one\" symbol is actually that what you're able to see in the tooltip ...\nJust installed my Ubuntu a few hours ago - hope to get this solved, as it only appears in Chromium, but not in the tooltips when hovering over things.\n\nA: I also have the same problem, but it depends on the website. Facebook is the worst.\nTo help the problem, I went to setting > language, and installed the Korean language. Ubuntu still uses English for everything as a default, I just now have Korean language packs and fonts. Most websites work better with Korean fonts.\n", "Q: How to preserve icons and emblems when copying files When I copy a file through Nautilus its emblem or icon is preserved, but if I do it with cp or rsync through CLI it isn't. Why, and how to fix it? \nBy preserved I mean that icons that I have manually changed stay like that when copying through Nautilus, and are otherwise reset to the default icons when copying through CLI. \n\nA: I wrote a small Perl script that solves this issue, metasave. It saves nautilus metadata in the form of a shell script that you need to run on the destination system.\nIf you want to copy files on the command line and preserve their metadata, you need to use gvfs-copy, Gnome's replacement of cp.\n\nA: WHY: Emblems are not a part of the file itself, they're stored somewhere inside Gnome - when you copy files using Nautilus, it is able to update the metadata in Gnome because Nautilus is a Gnome app and is aware of the existance of labels and emblems.\ncp, rsync and other non-Gnome commands, on the other hand, know nothing about labels and emblems and can do nothing to preserve them.\nHOW TO FIX: There may be no good way to fix it for every command-line utility which copies files. For some selected commands, such as cp you may look at writing some wrappers which set the emblems of the target files to match the emblems of the source files. This post may give you some pointers at how to set emblems from command line\n\nA: Try using rsync with the archive flag:\nrsync -av <source> <dest>\n\nIt could be that nautilus is preserving permissions such as executable and rsync & cp unless told are not.\n", "Q: Why some user functions don't get recognised by bash? I can define a function like:\nmyfunction () { ls -R \"$1\" ; }\nAnd then\nmyfunction .\njust works.\nBut if I do\necho \"myfunction .\" | sh\necho \"myfunction .\" | bash\n\nthe messages are:\nsh: myfunction: not found  \nbash: line 1: myfunction: command not found\n\nWhy? And how can I call a function that comes from a string if not by piping it to sh or bash?\nI know there is this command source, but I am confused of when I should use source and when sh or bash. Also, I cannot pipe through source. To add to confusion, there is this command . that seems to have nothing to do with the \".\" that means \"current directory\".\n\nA: A function definition only has an effect in the current instance of bash. When you write\necho \"myfunction .\" | bash\n\nyou run another instance of bash. You would need to define the function in that other instance.\nIf you have a string that contains a function name and arguments (quoted, if necessary), or more generally any string that contains some shell source code that you want to execute, use the eval builtin.\nmy_snippet='myfunction .'\neval \"$my_snippet\"\n\nIf you define functions in your .bashrc, they are only available in interactive shells, not in scripts.\nThe . command is (almost) equivalent to source, and has nothing to do with . meaning the current directory.\n\nA: Instead of using eval, you can export your function so it is inherited by subshells:\nmyfunction () { ls -R \"$1\" ; }\nexport -f myfunction\n\nAnd then\necho \"myfunction .\" | bash\n\njust works.\necho \"myfunction .\" | sh probably won't still, unless your /bin/sh is a symlink to bash.\n\nA: bash and sh expect their argument to be an executable file, not a string.\nYou can execute the contents of a string with\neval \"myfunction .\"\n\nWhen you run a program through the shell, it will normally invoke a new instance of bash (or sh, csh, zsh, etc. as appropriate), inherit all the original shell's settings, and run itself in the new shell. This allows you to temporarily set variables or change settings without interfering with your environment.\nsourceing a command will make it run it your current shell, so any changes it makes to the environment will persist when the command exits. . is a synonym for source.\nIn most circumstances, a script will specify what shell it is meant to run in (with #!/bin/bash in its first line, for example), and it isn't necessary for you to call bash explicitly.\n", "Q: Is there a way to alias the command cd so that it protects the arguments? When I run\ncd My folder\nThere is an error because I have not protected the string.\nbash: cd: My: No such file or directory\nBut this works fine\ncd \"My folder\"\nIs there a way to redefine cd as an alias or a function so that it automatically protects all the following arguments as one single string?\nThis approach did not work, as I supposed it wouldn't:\ncd () { cd \"$*\" ; }\n\nA: You can do it, but only if your directory names don't contain several consecutive spaces, and only if they contain no shell special character other than spaces.\ncd () { builtin cd \"$*\"; }\n\nIn practice, use completion: type cd My then press Tab. Bash will insert backslashes before special characters.\n", "Q: How to use https with apt-get? Does apt-get use https or any kind of encryption? Is there a way to configure it to use it?\n\nA: apt-get (and other package manipulation commands, which are a front-end to the same APT libraries) can use HTTP, HTTPS and FTP (and mounted filesystems). If you specify https:// URLs in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*, then APT will use HTTPS.\nAPT verifies the signature of packages. So you do not need to have a form of transportation that provides data authentication. If an attacker modifies the files you're downloading, this will be noticed. Using a signature verification is better than using an HTTPS connection, because it'll detect an attack on the server you're downloading from, not just an attack in transit.\nMore precisely, the (simplified) data flow for a package is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The package is produced on a build machine.\n\n*The package is signed on the build machine.\n\n*The signed package is copied to a download mirror.\n\n*You download the package.\n\n\nHTTPS ensures that step 4 happens correctly. The package signatures ensure that steps 2 to 4 happen correctly.\nIn fact, there is one small benefit to HTTPS for step 4: the package signatures only ensure that the package is authentic. An attacker in step 4 could impersonate a legitimate server and serve stale versions of the package. For example, the attacker could prevent you from downloading any security updates, in the hope of exploiting a vulnerability on your machine that you would have patched if it wasn't for the attack. This isn't a very realistic scenario, because it requires an active attacker (so that would have to be someone in control of your Internet connection), but it could happen in principle.\nThe other benefit to HTTPS would be if you're trying to hide the fact that you're downloading Ubuntu packages from someone snooping on your network connection. Even then, the eavesdropper could see what host you're connecting to; if you connect to an Ubuntu mirror and download hundreds of megabytes, it's clear that you're downloading Ubuntu packages. The eavesdropper could also mostly figure out which packages you're downloading from the size of the files. So HTTPS would only be useful if you're downloading from a server that also offers other files of similar size — I don't see any point except for third-party packages, and only in very unusual circumstances.\nTo reiterate: the usual benefit of HTTPS, which is that you know you're connected to the real server, is useless when you're downloading Ubuntu packages. The signature verification on packages gives a stronger guarantee than what HTTPS can provide.\n\nA: I think this question could use an answer with instructions for the layman, so…\nAPT still does not use HTTPS by default in daily builds of Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan) (which is still in development). One can verify this by examining the /etc/apt/sources.list file and noting that all of the source URLs utilize the \"http:\" URL scheme.\nTo configure it to use HTTPS, one can follow the following instructions:\nFirst, find a trustworthy official Ubuntu archive mirror that supports HTTPS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to the Official Archive Mirrors for Ubuntu webpage.\n\n*In the table on that webpage, identify mirrors that are (A) hosted on websites you consider to be trustworthy, (B) have an \"http:\" mirror and, optionally, (C) meet your geographical proximity, server speed, and update freshness preferences. \n\n*In the table on that webpage, click an \"http\" link of a mirror identified in step (2) to visit the  \"http:\" version of the mirror.\n\n*In the browser address bar, manually change \"http:\" in the webpage URL to \"https:\".\n\n*Navigate to the mirror again (via the \"https:\" URL) to see if it resolves.\n\n\nFor example, I consider the Wikimedia Foundation trustworthy, so I visited the http://mirrors.wikimedia.org/ubuntu/ mirror URL and subsequently changed it to https://mirrors.wikimedia.org/ubuntu/, which successfully resolves.\nIf you use Firefox (67.0.4) and have the HTTPS Everywhere (2019.6.27) extension installed with the \"Encrypt All Sites Eligible\" feature enabled (via the toolbar button panel), steps (4) and (5) can be omitted because the extension will automatically modify the URL to utilize HTTPS, allowing one to more immediately determine whether the \"https:\" version of the URL will resolve.\nTwo, update your APT sources list:\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute the command sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup to backup your update sources list.\n\n*Replace the mirror base URL—shown here as https://mirrors.wikimedia.org—in the command sudo sed --in-place --regexp-extended 's http://(us\\.archive\\.ubuntu\\.com|security\\.ubuntu\\.com) https://mirrors.wikimedia.org g' /etc/apt/sources.list with the mirror base URL of your preferred mirror and, then, execute the command.\n\n\nThirdly, you should examine the contents of the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory for \"http:\" sources that might be changed to \"https:\" after installing software from outside the Ubuntu archive.\nFor example, Microsoft's Visual Studio Code package adds a vscode.list file to this directory that specifies an \"http:\" URL. Simple changing the URL scheme from \"http:\" to \"https:\" allows updates over HTTPS.\nConsider backing up any such source files before modifying them.\nLastly, perform an update to ensure that updates will work correctly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute the sudo apt-get update command.\n\n*If that doesn't work as expected, restore the backup source list file(s) you made by executing the sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list.backup /etc/apt/sources.list command.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that there's an apt-transport-https package to add HTTPS support to APT. However, this package is apparently unnecessary according to the webpage https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/eoan/+package/apt-transport-https and has not been needed since APT 1.5 according to the information shown after executing the command apt-cache show apt-transport-https.\n\nA: Recent APT releases have TLS support built in, so you simply need to replace your package-repository mirror URLs with https-prefixed ones. For Debian, it could look like this:\ndeb https://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch main\ndeb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security stretch/updates main\ndeb https://deb.debian.org/debian/ stretch-updates main\n\nThis is useful, even though APT includes its own signature protocol to ensure packages aren't tampered with, because there can be bugs in APT (as there have been: CVE-2016-1252, CVE-2019-3462). The HTTP/TLS protocols and their ciphers are subject to intense scrutiny, so a severe zero-day vulnerability is much less likely if you add this layer of security.\n\nA: With APT, typically what is more important is not that your connection is encrypted, but that the files you are receiving haven't been tampered with.\nAPT has built-in signature verification to ensure this.  \nEncryption would prevent eavesdroppers from being able to see what you are downloading, but what you are actually downloading (and requesting) is pretty uncontroversial: it'll be the same as thousands of other Ubuntu users are downloading and the files contain nothing that isn't freely available on lots of servers.  Still, if you need privacy about what packages in particular you're downloading, HTTPS can be used (specify it in your sources.list).\nThe signature verification that is built in to APT will ensure that the files you receive have not been tampered with.  It doesn't really matter where the files come from and it's even possible to have proxies or reverse proxies in between you and the server to reduce server load or speed you up.  The signature verification still ensures that you are getting the unmodified file, matching the signature that could only be cryptographically produced with the original file and a copy of Ubuntu's private key.\nIf you switch to HTTPS, then you won't be able to take advantage of proxy servers for speeding up access or reducing load anymore.  And it wouldn't add any more assurance about non-tampering that APT's signature verification doesn't already give.  It would, however, mean that eavesdroppers (such as your ISP) will not be able to see which packages you're downloading (which is not likely to be confidential, and as Gilles pointed out they could guess from the file size).\n\nA: Apt 1.5 released 2017 supports https out the box. It is no longer necessary to install package apt-transport-https separately.\nThere are multiple attacks and vulnerabilities against apt with http repositories:\n\n*\n\n*A Look In the Mirror: Attacks on Package Managers\n\n*https://justi.cz/security/2019/01/22/apt-rce.html\n", "Q: Is there any way to completely wipe Ubuntu? I've completely screwed up my Ubuntu install, and want to start over (I want to try a different edition anyway, so downloading a new package using apt-get won't be necessary). Is there any way to completely wipe the boot disk using UNIX commands? As it happens, in screwing up my Ubuntu, I've gotten rid of the GUI, and it freezes when I try to boot into GUI-less mode; recovery mode is my only option.\n\nA: There's no need to erase the old install prior to installing the new one. Just boot from the LiveCD of the new Ubuntu, choose manual partitioning and make sure you choose to format the root partition. \nIf you have your home directory on a separate partition, you may keep it, which will preserve your documents - but, as usual, making a backup of all your data is essential before re-installing.\n\nA: Here's a way to completely and thoroughly wipe your disk or partition. But take the usual warnings to heart. Backup anything important and make sure you put the right info in the output file field. Also note most OS installs prompts will let you overwrite previous installs or re-partition as part of the installation process. This method is destructive and extremely hard to recover and data from(if even possible). \nWith just about any linux live CD you could boot into a live environment and run the following command in a terminal. This will completely erase the data, bit by bit, overwriting it with zeros.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdax\n\nReplace \"sdax\" with the proper disk and partition to be formatted. Sit back, and relax.\nBe careful you erase the right thing.\nDo this at your own risk.\n", "Q: mkdir in Ubuntu does not work I wrote this command in my editor but no result (no warehouse directory) \nsudo mkdir -p /Downloads/hive/warehouse\n\nHow do I make this work?\n\nA: What do you mean by an \"editor\"?  Why would you expect a result from writing something in an editor, instead of the terminal?\nAnd where do you think the folder is created ? Because of the starting /, you are asking Ubuntu to create a directory at the root of your system, not in your home or whatever.\n\nA: You did not list your editor, nor your complete script, nor from which privilege/user (rights) you execute the bash script. This is a correct fully functioning syntax to create a folder in C:\\ that is (also visible in Windows 10 explorer) when created in a bash script named example.sh (in Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL) Ubuntu 16.04:\n#!/bin/bash\n#First a non-parametric example:\nsudo mkdir -p \"/mnt/c/exampleFolderOne\"\n\n#Secondly, a parametric example, first store the path as a string:\nstringName=\"/mnt/c/exampleFolderTwo\"\n\n#Make the actual folder\nsudo mkdir \"$stringName\"\n\nThe protocol followed to do this was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start up windows 10 with administrator rights. (So not logging in in the user named \"administrator\" but just a normal Windows 10 user account that has admin rights.)\n\n*Open WSL Ubuntu 16.04\n\n*Aquire root with command sudo su\n\n*in terminal: go to the folder where you want to create the example.sh bash script. In this case that was /home/<username>/maintenance.\n\n*enter: sudo nano example.sh and press <enter>.\n\n*copy paste the text of the code listed in above in this post.\n\n*Ctrl+x to quit.\n\n*Y to store changes\n\n*Press <enter>\n\n*Then make the bash script runnable with command (whilst still in the same folder)\n\n*chmod +x example.sh\n\n*Then run the script with command:\n\n*./example.sh\n\n*This will create the two folders shown in the attached figure in harddrive c:/ (which in Ubuntu is reached with /mnt/c).\n\n*The creation of the folder is verified by opening the folder where you create the folders and pressing F5 or refreshing the explorer view and seeing the folders in the explorer view.\n\n\n\nI assume my solution is trivial and that your problem is has a different cause, but at the very least this can be a form of excluding potential causes (such as typos or procedural errors) of your problem.\n", "Q: How do I create a bootable USB on Ubuntu from Hiren's Boot CD ISO for Windows?

From there you just run it and the rest explains itself.\n\nA: None of the below methods will work.\nAlthough you will get a bootable USB, it doesn't chainload anything out of the Grub Menu. This is especially true for the 'revised' edition of Hiren's Boot CD (the one with the mini-version of Windows XP)\nHere is the correct procedure:\nInsert your USB drive into your PC and start Ubuntu's partition Manager. Format the drive to FAT32, primairy partition and give a nice label.\nWhile you are at it, note the device's mount location (for example /dev/sdb)\nWhen it is done, close the partition manager and start a terminal.\nsudo grub-install /dev/device location\n\nWhere 'device location' is the location of your USB drive you noted earlier.\nNow place the Hirens Boot CD iso-file in a new folder.\nRight-click the file and choose 'extract here'\nWhen it is done, delete the iso file and copy all the rest of the content to the root your USB drive.\nThere should be 1 folder called HBCD on the drive now, and 4 small other files.\nNow open the folder called HBCD and copy the files 'grldr' and 'menu.lst' to the root of the drive. Be sure to copy them, do not cut.\nThat is it, you're done.\nIt should work now as a bootable USB drive aswel as a tool you can use inside a MS Windows environment.\n\nA: Unetbootin does the job of making a bootable USB, but for recent versions of Hiren's CD to work, a small fix must be made for the menu to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Software Center and install UNetbootin .\n\n*Create the bootable USB using the Diskimage option and selecting the downloaded ISO.\n\n*After the USB is created, mount it in Nautilus (just click the USB drive icon),  go into the HBCD folder, rename the isolinux.cfg file to syslinux.cfg and copy it to the root of the USB, overwriting the existing file. Change the first line of syslinux.cfg from DEFAULT /HBCD/Boot/menu.c32 to DEFAULT menu.c32. \nNow the USB boots and menu works fine :)\n\nA: Ok I found a solution here\nThis approach use grub2 and so it is very convenient if you want to do a multi boot usb  \n\n\n*\n\n*install grub 2 on the usb driver ( grub-install --force --no-floppy --boot-directory=[PATH_TO_USB] /dev/sd[X] \n\n*extract Hiren iso files on the usb ( you should have a folder /HBCD in the root of the usb )\n\n*copy grub.exe (can be found in hbcd\\dos\\dos.gz, inside the .img file)\n\n*copy menu.lst from the hbcd folder to the root of the usb drive\n\n*add the following menu entry to grub.cfg on the usb:\n\n\nHere the menu entry:\nmenuentry \"HBCD\" {  \n    linux16 /grub.exe --config-file=\"find --set-root /HBCD/menu.lst; configfile /HBCD/menu.lst\"  \n}\n\nOnce compleated you can reboot or test it with qemu:\nqemu-system-x86_64 -hda /dev/sd[X]\n\nA: get hiren's Iso into your HDD. insert your USB pendrive or whatever, download rufus http://rufus.akeo.ie/   and proceed with burning the hiren.ISO  file into the USB.\nonce you succeeded, you need to restart your pc and check that your BIOS is configured in such a way that your boot order has your harddrive as the last thing to boot from.\nAlso make sure, that as you reboot your pc again, and you have your USB burned and plugged, you dont have anything else that your pc might boot from.\nHope it helps (btw, i just did this 30 minutes ago...) Cheers!\n\nA: There is a easy way of installing Hiren's Boot CD 15.2 on Linux (Ubuntu, Linuxmint, etc.). \nDownload the Universal USB Installer\nhttps://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\nand open in WINE. Choose Hirens Boot CD and everything is working like you would do it under Windows.\n\nA: Another unusual approach that just saved me in this situation and hence should be mentioned here, is, that GRUB2 can boot ISO images directly!\nThe Ubuntu help describes it as such:\n\n*\n\n*Install grml-rescueboot.\n\n*Place your ISO in /boot/grml/.\n\n*Run sudo update-grub\nThis will automatically create a boot entry for every ISO in that directory, using loopback and chain-loading.\nSo as long as you got a working Linux partition of any kind that has GRUB2 (wich is much easier and reliable to achieve), you can boot any ISO, even if it’s a problematic one.\nSaving a normal Linux user from even needing any external medium.\n(Though loopbacks can boot isos from other partitions/media too, if you are willing to not use grml-rescueboot and do the GRUB2 config manually.)\n\nA: You can make a bootable USB on Ubuntu from any (bootable) .ISO image using dd command:\ndd if=./someisofile.iso of=/dev/sdb\n\nhowever, I'd like to warn you that dd is a very dangerous command and you should only proceed if you fully understand the meaning of its parameters, in particular, the of one. \nIf you google for something like \"dd iso usb\", you'll fins quite a few tutorials, for example this one from Fedora, this one from Linux Mint, or this one from ArchLinux\n\nA: Grub 2 - Tutorial\nFormat your USB-Stick with FAT32 and:\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and type sudo su // or su to get root access\n\n\n*Type fdisk -l (and note which device is your USB)\n\n\n*Type mkdir /mnt/USB && mount /dev/sdx1 /mnt/USB (replacing x with your actual usb device)\n\n\n*Type grub-install --force --removable --boot-directory=/mnt/USB/boot /dev/sdx (replacing  x with your actual USB device)\n\n\n*Type cd /mnt/USB/boot/grub\n\n\n*Create a file /mnt/USB/boot/grub/grub.cfg with the following content:\nset default=0\n\nmenuentry \"HBCD\" {  \n    linux16 /grub.exe --config-file=\"find --set-root /HBCD/menu.lst; configfile /HBCD/menu.lst\"  \n}\n\n\n\n*Copy the content of the hirens.iso to the root directory of your USB-Stick (like /mnt/USB/ )\nGreetings Tom\n", "Q: Intel Ivy Bridge Z77 Driver for Ubuntu 12.04 I was wondering where I can get the repository for the latest Intel Z77 chipset from?\nI've got the new Intel Ivy Bridge 3570K along with with the built in HD4000 video card.\n12.04 keeps freezing randomly.

I am not sure if this causes a security issue.\nEDIT: Not sure if this did clear up the problem, things are getting funky!\n\nA: startx doesn't work \nSeems like you lost write-rights...  Check whether the solution described here will work for you.  This happened to me.\nI found a solution for me:\nI changed my password, reinstalled xserver-xorg by typing: sudo apt-get install --reinstall xorg\nAfter a reboot it worked for me. Notice: I removed the .XAuthority files in /home/username by: sudo rm /home/username/.XAuthority*\nto get a shell try Strg-Alt-F1 when you turn on your computer. I actually got my write-rights back by using clear in recovery mode.\n\nA: This is the shorter version of Dig's answer, which solved my problem. root had taken ownership over my profile's .Xauthority file. In order to resolve the issue you need to assign ownership over this file back to the user.\nsudo chown username:username .Xauthority\n\n\nA: Logging in as root at the command shell level and renaming the user's \n/home/user/.Xauthority  and then rebooting seemed to cure the issue.

This will get you to a terminal-like screen. It will show you something like this:\n[COMPUTER NAME] login:\nfor example,\nAspire-4755g login:\ntype in your username and press Enter. This will result into something like this,\nAspire-4755g login: shiela\nPassword:\nEnter your password, and, if correct, would show something like this:\nAspire-4755g login: shiela\nPassword:\nLast login: Tue Jan  1 06:45:02 JPT 2013 on tty1\nWelcome to Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-35-generic-pae i686)\n* Documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/\n2 packages can be updated.\n0 update are security updates.\nshiela@Aspire-4755g:~s\nThen, press the keyboard sequence Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get you back to the login screen. This procedure logs you into the system using the terminal-like window. You can now try to login to your account using the login screen. In my experience, I was able to reach the desktop. It seems that there is something wrong with the lightdm configuration that it was not able to log you in to the system.\nShould you not make it to the desktop (as it was called in Windows), you may try adding an additional command by pressing the Ctrl+Alt+F1:\nshiela@Aspire-4755g:~s ecryptfs-mount-private\npress Enter, and it will ask you your password. Enter your password, then press the keyboard sequence Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get you back to the login screen (or to where you last left).\nThis command loads your Home folder, together with its contents, should you have chosen to encrypt the home folder upon installation of Ubuntu.\nOnce successful, you may try to review your lightdm configuration located on /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.\n\nA: I had same issue, I uninstalled 12.04 version and installed 12.10 Version and the problem is gone.\n\nA: Yes I caused a Login Loop on my main Ubuntu 12.10 user and the fix was simple.\nBackground: Ubuntu 12.10 is installed in VirtualBox running on Windows 7 and uses Unity.\nCause: From the Desktop I Ctrl+Alt+T into terminal mode and then tried to run 'startx' (I was trying to help a friend over the phone late at night...but this was a stupid thing to do). A new blank Unity desktop appeared and everything hung...\nProblem: Forcing VirtualBox to close and then rebooting Ubuntu I got to the login screen but kept looping back to this same screen everytime after entering the password. No errors were displayed. I could login as Guest but I had no Sudo rights and thus no control... However once logged in as Guest I Ctrl+Alt+F3 and got to a terminal login. I entered my main user name and password and logged in with command mode. Logout took me back to CLI login and Ctrl+Alt+F7 took me back to Guest desktop. So my account still worked. I then added a test user and gave them sudo rights. From the Unity login I could login and logout Test user with no problem. So Unity still worked.\nFix: So my main account was still accessable via CLI and Unity was working for all other accounts. This indicated a configuation problem on my main account. I followed the advice of Ubuntu gets stuck in a login loop and did chown username:username .Xauthority. This fixed my problem.\n\nA: I had a similar issue. Mine was that I had done sudo -E -s or something at some point. and restarted x, thus root beeing owner of my user's .Xauthority. When I changed ownership back to my normal user, it was golden.\n\nA: I had the same problem on Ubuntu 13.04. The reason was, that I had some custom entries in the .profile file in my home dir. After removing these entries (as written before: Ctrl+Alt+F1, login, cd ~, edit the file) and a reboot, everything was fine again.\n\nA: I just had a similar problem (the login loops)  it even gave me that little drum sound, went black and back to the login screen.  Plus I have run into other problems tonight.  I have been searching around for the last few hours, with the help of you (the ubuntu community) I picked out a few tips and ideas.  I tried logining in as guest (worked but unhelpful.) The list of things I have done tonight to solve this,\n  Renaming that .Xauthority to .Xauth_bak,\n  safe mode terminal to do a disk scan and repair, sudo update this and that.   The biggest and most helpful action was--- my Home was 100% full????  from the guest account I  CTRL+ALT+F1 and logged in with my regular name and pw, sudo rm .Trash*  that made a 2% difference, at that point I was able to ctrl+alt+F7 back to the login screen, I was able to get in!!!! now to clean the 98% issue, I know I dont have that much.  <--- hope this helps someone,  Thank You Ubuntu Community!!! \n", "Q: AMD CPU overclocking software?

To run certain Windows programs in WINE you need to this workaround:\necho 0|sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\n\nAccording to the support websites, this is due to a bug in the Ubuntu kernel that prevents ptrace and WINE playing well together.\nUsing the above command you set the ptrace to 0 which according the research I've done(don't ask me which websites, I have seem a lot of them), ptrace has to do with the interactions between programs.  The 0 setting is more permissive than the 1.  \nI have to assume that there was a good reason Ubuntu wanted the ptrace=1 so this leads me back to the short form of the question.\nAre there any risks involved in setting ptrace=0.  Lower security? problems debugging?  any others that I haven't thought of???\nP.S.  for anybody reading this that wonders what the bug causes, the Windows programs will fail to open at all, in the System Monitor you will see many instances of the program trying to open and then they will eventually all quit and if you run the progam for the terminal you will get an error that tells you that the maximum number of program instances has been reached.\n\nA: Short answer: no practical danger yet, but read on for a better way...\n\nWhat's this ptrace thing anyway?\n\nthis is due to a bug in the Ubuntu kernel that prevents ptrace and WINE playing well together.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*No, ptrace protection is a deliberate kernel security measure first introduced around Ubuntu 10.10. It's not a bug, and so isn't going to be \"fixed\".\n\n*In simple terms, the default ptrace_scope value of 1 blocks one process from examining and modifying another process unless the second process (child) was started by the first process (parent).\n\n*This can cause problems with some programs under Wine because of the way wineserver provides \"Windows Services\" to these programs.\nWhat are the risks in setting ptrace_scope to 0?\n\n\n*\n\n*This restores the old behavior where one process can \"trace\" another process, even if there is no parent-child relationship.\n\n*In theory, a piece of malware can use this to harm you/your computer; e.g. it can attach to Firefox and log all of your URLs/passwords, etc. In practice this is extremely unlikely unless you blindly install binary debs from random sites, etc.\n\n*As far as debugging goes, the 0 settings is in fact required for gdb, strace, etc. to attach to non-children unless you run them with elevated privileges (sudo).\nWhat are the problems with the workaround?\n\n\n*\n\n*The workaround is somewhat problematic because ptrace_scope is a global value, and while it's set to 0, all processes on your system are exempt from the non-child restriction.\n\n*If you use the workaround, put it in a simple bash script that enables it, runs your Windows program and then disables (sets to 1) on exit.\n\n*\n\n*DO NOT make ptrace_scope world-writable (666) as the forum post recommends -- that is a huge security risk because now any process can change it at will!\n\n\n\nIs there a better solution?\n\n\n*\n\n*A better solution which is more secure and does not require repetitively modifying ptrace_scope is to grant Wineserver ptrace capabilities.\n\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install libcap2-bin \nsudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip /usr/bin/wineserver\nsudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip /usr/bin/wine-preloader\n\n\n*This exempts the wineserver and wine-preloader binaries from the non-child ptrace restriction, and allows them to ptrace any process.\n\n*It only needs to be done once, and is safer because these binaries are usually from a trusted source - the official repositories or the official Wine PPA, so they aren't going to be malware.\n\n\n\nIf you're using Crossover\nInstall libcap2:\nsudo apt-get install libcap2-bin;\n\nThen, add an exception for Crossover:\nsudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip /opt/cxoffice/bin/wineserver;\nsudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip /opt/cxoffice/bin/wine-preloader;\n\nFinally, add its libraries to ld.so.conf (or you will get \"error while loading shared libraries: libwine.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\"): \necho /opt/cxoffice/lib/ | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/crossover.conf\nsudo /sbin/ldconfig\n\nA: In the ubuntuforums.org I got an answer with the following link\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Roadmap/KernelHardening#ptrace_Protection\nhere is the paste from the link(with my emphasis added)\n\nAs Linux grows in popularity, it will become a growing target for malware. One particularly troubling weakness of the Linux process interfaces is that a single user is able to examine the memory and running state of any of their processes. For example, if one application (e.g. firefox) was compromised, it would be possible for an attacker to attach to other running processes (e.g. gpg-agent) to extract additional credentials and continue to expand the scope of their attack.\nThis is not a theoretical problem. SSH session hijacking and even arbitrary code injection is fully possible if ptrace is allowed normally.\nFor a solution, some applications use prctl() to specifically disallow such ptrace attachment (e.g. ssh-agent). A more general solution is to only allow ptrace directly from a parent to a child process (i.e. direct gdb and strace still work), or as the root user (i.e. gdb BIN PID, and strace -p PID still work as root).\nThis behavior is controlled via the /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope sysctl value. The default is \"1\" to block non-child ptrace. A value of \"0\" restores the prior more permissive behavior, which may be more appropriate for some development systems and servers with only admin accounts. Using \"sudo\" can also grant temporarily ptrace permissions via the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability, though this method allows the ptrace of any process.\n\nSo I guess the short answer would be that it's less secure but the likely hood of a personal computer coming under those kinds of attacks would be pretty slim.\n\nA: UPDATE The above instructions:\nsudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip /opt/cxoffice/bin/wineserver;\nsudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip /opt/cxoffice/bin/wine-preloader;\n\ndoes not work as of 9/15/2018 on Ubuntu 18.04.1 and PlayOnLinux v.4.2.12 using the latest stable version Wine which is v.3.0.1   libcap2 was already installed.\nThe error message in Gnome Terminal is as follows:\nFailed to set capabilities on file `/usr/bin/wineserver' (Invalid argument)\nThe value of the capability argument is not permitted for a file.

Observe this re-enactment:\n\n$ sudo dpkg -i --force-architecture google-earth-stable_current_i386.deb\n...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n google-earth-stable:i386\n\n$ dpkg --list | grep google-earth\niU  google-earth-stable:i386               6.0.3.2197-r0                        \n\nThe iU tells you that you wanted this package i-nstalled, but dpkg couldn't configure it, so it was leaving it U-nconfigured, waiting for you to fix it. The error you got dpkg: error processing google-earth-stable:i386 (--configure): dependency problems - leaving unconfigured tells you as much in simpler language.\ndpkg must be explicitly told to remove a failed install\nJust tell dpkg to not bother and remove the package:\nsudo dpkg --remove google-earth-stable:i386\nAnd then try installing the 64-bit package again.\nSynaptic and apt-get don't care about one-off debs\nYou got nothing out of Synaptic or apt-get because they aren't aware of your problem. They concern themselves primarily with packages available in the repositories, which you manage through them. They are higher level tools which use dpkg under the hood, but don't care about any problems you create with dpkg unless it concerns them. If you tried to install any package, or Google Earth 64-bit if it was in some repository, with Synaptic or apt-get, they would definitely have whined about it.\nOther helpful references\n\n*\n\n*The .deb file name and package name are usually different. You need the package name to do any operations with dpkg. Use dpkg --list | grep xxxxx where xxxxx is a small part of the file name sure to be in there, like google or earth.\n\n\n*See this answer for a great explanation of all the two-letter dpkg status flags.\n", "Q: How do I allow all possible IPs for Gmail servers through my ufw firewall? I am currently using the following rule:\nufw allow out from my_local_ip to any port 587\nThis is a little too lax for my liking.  I would like to tighten it up and restrict it to only gmail's smtp server ip addresses, but they are always changing.  I used to just wait until an outgoing email didn't make it to its destination, then check syslog for the ip address that was blocked, then add that to the ufw configure script.  However, now I have a need for much more reliability.\nIs there any way to use smtp.gmail.com in ufw?  I don't think so, but thought I would ask.  Any other ideas?  Thanks.\nUpdate\nTaking izx's suggestion, I obtained the following (abbreviated) info from whois:\n$ whois 74.125.53.108\n...\nNetRange:       74.125.0.0 - 74.125.255.255\nCIDR:           74.125.0.0/16\n...\nUsing this info I created the following command in my ufw configuration script (I realize there are other ranges to open, this is just an example): \nufw allow out from 192.168.2.5 to 74.125.0/24.0/24 port 587 \n\nbut ufw does not like that. So I changed it to:\nufw allow out from 192.168.2.5 to 74.125.0.0/24 port 587\n\nthis ufw accepted but obviously this will only block any address in this range with 0 as the third octet.  So how do I get from 0-255 for the third octet as well?\n\nA: You'd need a script that periodically resolves the domain and updates firewall rules with the latest IP. Instead, try this method:\nDomains like these often have multiple IPs associated with them. Use host domain.tld to get a list:\n\n$ host smtp.gmail.com\nsmtp.gmail.com is an alias for gmail-smtp-msa.l.google.com.\ngmail-smtp-msa.l.google.com has address 74.125.127.108\ngmail-smtp-msa.l.google.com has address 74.125.127.109\n\nBut these two also probably keep changing, based on your question. So it's best to whitelist the entire netblock -- use whois with the IP:\n\n$ whois 74.125.127.108\n\nNetRange:       74.125.0.0 - 74.125.255.255\nCIDR:           74.125.0.0/16\nOriginAS:       \nNetName:        GOOGLE\nNetHandle:      NET-74-125-0-0-1\nParent:         NET-74-0-0-0-0\nNetType:        Direct Allocation\nRegDate:        2007-03-13\nUpdated:        2012-02-24\nRef:            http://whois.arin.net/rest/net/NET-74-125-0-0-1\n...\n\nThe NetRange/CIDR tell you what to whitelist -- 74.125.0.0/16.

One was:\n\n\"OpenOffice decided not to have a learning curve\"\n\nAnother was:\n\n\"Firefox tries very hard to make sure pages written in 1995 look like they did in 1995. \"\n\nAnd finally:\n\n\"Windows isn't a poor man's Linux.\"\n\nIn that final statement, shouldn't it be the opposite?\n\nA: \nWindows isn't a poor man's Linux.\n\nI think that is emphasizing the fact that there is no need to look down on windows. Windows is good, and is very suitable for lots of people and business. Saying windows is a poor mans linux does not aid anyone's cause (or vice versa).\n(the other points seem well explained in other answers)\n\nA: \n\"OpenOffice decided not to have a learning curve\"\n\nThe OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice office suites have retained a traditional interface that most users (of them or any other office suite) are likely to find familiar and pretty easy to use, without having to learn it or get used to it first.\nIn contrast, some other office suites, including newer versions of Microsoft Office, have implemented substantial interface changes, often again and again with each version. These changes arguably introduce some substantial benefits, but at the cost of confusing users and making them learn something new. Learning new things is great, but most people don't use word processors and spreadsheet software for its own sake.\nWhile making sure users continue to be able to migrate from Microsoft Office is a substantial consideration that goes into the development of OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice, it's worth taking note that these office suites have deliberately not changed their interfaces to mirror the newer Microsoft Office interfaces. It's more important that OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice users be able to use OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice without interruption, than for people who have only used new versions of Microsoft Office to be able to switch to them without having to figure anything out.\nFortunately, the OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice interfaces are designed reasonably intuitively and they are well-documented (with pretty good help materials), so people who have only used office suites with different interfaces should be able to learn to use them without too much difficulty, even many years from now.\n\n\"Firefox tries very hard to make sure pages written in 1995 look like they did in 1995.\"\n\nThe Firefox web browser is written in such a way as to maintain backward compatibility as well as possible with old web content. Not only should old web pages load and function as well as they did with browsers that were current when the pages were created, but they should do so seamlessly (without the user having to enable any sort of \"compatibility mode\") and they should look as close as possible as they used to look...or at least as close as possible to the way they looked with previous versions of Firefox.\n\n\"Windows isn't a poor man's Linux.\"\n\nEither the reverse is intended (\"Linux isn't a poor man's Windows\"), or this statement is unclear and needs to be modified and/or further explained. Either way, this should probably be reported as a bug in Ubuntu's community documentation. Perhaps you would be willing to do this? In any case, if we wait for some more answers here, maybe we can gain more insight into what may be intended by that statement, which could help in reporting the bug.\nEDIT: There's been a great deal of speculation in comments and answers as to what \"Linux isn't a poor man's Windows\" means. Several peripherally similar but ultimately different ideas have been proposed. I think this shows even more strongly that this sentence is unclear, and that its current form in documentation for novices constitutes a bug.\n\nA: *\n\n*It means that OpenOffice decided not to move away from what is familiar; if you are familiar with the Microsoft Office suite, you should not need to learn anything new with OpenOffice. To be fair, there is a learning curve with OpenOffice but it isn't very steep (i.e. it's not difficult).\n\n*It means that whatever problems existed with web pages in 1995, Firefox will make sure that those problems still exist. What you should take away from this is that Firefox will try to draw things the way they looked like in 1995.\n\n*You need to look at the whole statement to understand this:\n\nLinux isn't just Windows with funny colours, and Windows isn't a poor man's Linux. Both represent decades of hard work by people with different opinions about the world, and both need to be treated differently if you want to get the most out of them.\n\nWhat the author means is that you shouldn't judge Windows/Linux from the perspective of the other. Specifically, one shouldn't deride Windows as a cheap and poor substitute for Linux (i.e. a poor man's Linux) because it wasn't designed to do the things that Linux does. The paragraph is trying to say that both operating systems have their place and are designed differently. They should be judged on their individual merits, not from the perspective of another operating system.\n\nA: I tend to agree with Eliah Kagan's answer, except for the third statement.\nI think the explanation of the third statement (Windows isn't a poor man's Linux) should \nbe found in the paragraph named Linux has a long, smooth learning curve:\n\nWindows programs generally recognise two types of problems: those that\n  they were specifically designed to handle (which they make unbeatably\n  easy), and everything else (which they make unbearably difficult).\n  Most Windows users find everything very intuitive except “that\n  incomprehensible geeky stuff”, which usually means the contents of the\n  Windows folder, the registry, or DLLs.\n\nLinux doesn't make that big of a distinction between the two areas (except maybe ensuring operations in \"danger\" area are made after safer authorization). Because of this I think we can say that Linux treats users as more intelligent people, compared to windows (in fact windows discourages the understanding of how it works in its deep, which is the opposite philosophy than the GNU/Linux one).\nAs a closing paragraph it's understandable that the article tends to clarify that its statements are not dogmas (there's a part of Linux that made the opposite choice, ibidem).\nEven if it says that Windows aims to keep latest versions of 20-year-old applications working like they did when they were first created and Linux looks to the future, nonetheless there are applications (like Firefox) that look to the past too, taking care of backward compatibility.\nEven if it says that Windows likes its users to think less while Linux likes its users to think more, Windows is not a poor man's Linux where poor (as far as I understand it) might stand for \"dumb\" or \"of poor intellect\" (I couldn't find the english expression that correponds to my native language's one, so I translated it literally, I hope it's as effective as it is in italian). The article's explanation seems to be that each OS's flaws should be contextualized chronologically and philosophically (which means: would you consider medieval people stupid for gathering water from wells using buckets, instead of building aqueducts? Or would you consider wrong the eskimos way of dressing compared to papuan people way of dressing?)\nThe conclusion to take seems to be: Everything needs context.\n\nA: Instead of concentrating on the specific three question quoted from the linked document, I'd like to remark that Linux is an Open Source environment, and the consequences of this matter are more destructive than a typical PC user can think of.\nThat page seems very cool, but (IMHO) it doesn't explain the REAL soul of the Open Source community, where Ubuntu comes from. It explain the superficial effects of what the collaboration of hundred (probably thousands) of persons, each one with its attitudes, thoughts, competence and history. Each mentioned project (i.e. Libre Office, OpenOffice, Firefox) have a developers community (which has decided what and how develop) and a user community (which is used and giving feedback); nobody can summarize what a Windows user can expect on a Linux-based system.\nI feel to tell you that, by using Ubuntu (and generally every Open Source enviroment), the major change is that you are free, in every way and shades you can think. Often this freedom is confusing most of the new user in this universe, and this is the reason because there are pages like the one you have linked; sadly, it represents the opinion of few people inside a very (very) large community.\nHave a nice free beer, since here the beer is always free.\n\nA: I think the statement 'Windows isn't a poor man's Linux' is a deliberate prod at most peoples' mindsets, who think in terms of Linux being a poor man's Windows (because it costs nothing). I agree with Eliah Kagan's comments in this thread. The reversal of roles in the statement forces people to think a bit about what is meant by 'poor', and it clearly is not talking about money.\n\nA: *\n\n*It means openoffice is meant to be easy to migrate from MS word to, so you don't have to have a \"learning curve\"\n\n*It means that Firefox has compatibly with older web pages.\n\n*????\n\nA: \"Windows isn't a poor man's Linux.\" is meant to make a joke and make you think by using the opposite of the opposite of what people would expect. \nBecause Linux is free, people might think, that Linux is a poor mans Windows, so if you can't afford Windows, you would try Linux. \nBut there are some points against this view. MS made a huge marketing campaign about \"total costs of ownership\", arguing that people are used to Windows, and teaching them Linux is more expensive than a Windows License, which is of course not a fair comparing, since you could start with Linux as well (and maybe should in public schools). \nBut often you have paid already for the Windows License, since cheap hardware offers come in huge numbers, and Windows is preinstalled. Try to get a Laptop without preinstalled Windows - it's nearly impossible. Few dealers offer them, and rarely big ones like Dell sell a single model. \nBut Windows is cheap, compare it to MacOS and Apple! But it isn't a poor mans Linux because it fails short in reaching the usability of Linux, it only runs on few plattforms and isn't customizable. Windows is less than a poor mans Linux. ;) \n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't seem to execute my .profile file (I'm kinna n00bish)\n1: I had ubuntu 11.10 installed, then upgraded to 12.04.\n2: I had a script in my .profile file to turn off my laptop's touchpad (it worked, and was executed on login)\n3: Now it doesn't get executed on login.\n4: if I 'source .profile' the script still works.\n5: Still using gnome (if that matters)\nI need that script to be run on login, so what should I do?\nShould i put my personal scripts in another file, or is there a way to get ubuntu to execute my file again?\nThx, you guys rule!\n\nA: Do you have a .bash_profile or .bash_login in your home directory.

They got more frequent.\nNow, first thought: It's an old card. But I don't have the bucks to buy a new one, and my mobo doesn't have the DVI input that my monitor needs. So, I decided to take a shot with the Nouveau drives. \nAmazingly, they have worked flawlessly. Does anyone have a guess as to why? \n\nA: There are three possible reasons I can think of\n\n\n*\n\n*Less bugs, better compatibility: The source is open — with the nouveau drivers, you probably have a lot more people looking at the code, and it is also easier to deal with changes on the X Windows System and linux kernel sides that break the driver code, and bugs are easier to track.\n\n*Issues with 3D acceleration part of the video card, or some feature that is only supported by the proprietary drivers. It is possible that your card is actually damaged, and that you don't get random crashes because nouveau does not use the affected components.\n\n*Bad memory. I don't know to which extent are the drivers so different that their different memory usage patterns explain this, but you may have some bad main memory or video card memory (random crashes are a common effect of bad memory). The former is easier to test, using memtest86+, the latter may be supported by tools like memtest86+, but I've never played with video card memory stress testing...\n", "Q: How do I setup a pppoe connection in Ubuntu?

But if you uses '/etc/network/interfaces' to set up your connections, NetworkManager will not manage those interfaces mentioned there. And NetworkManager will not tell those other programs that there are a internet connection.\nIf that is your problem, either comment out the connections in interfaces file or remove the packages with NetworkManager.\n\nA: Most likely you are successfully connected to your local network, probably through a router.  However the router (or another link behind it such as a cable mode) is having problems.  \nPower everything off and then power on in order of modem, router and pcs.\nThe order is actually important.\n\nA: It is my understanding that the wlan panel indicator source code is somewhat aged and possibly misinterprets newer kernel info. It then apparently falls back to reporting the signal strength that comes available when the link is associated but ignores if a network address is assigned or not. I'd rather add the xfce4-indicator-plugin to the panel and let gnome-network-manager display the signal strength.\n\nA: \"The wireless indicator in the corner says I'm connected but applications like Firefox and the Software Center say I'm not.\"\nRead carefully: your wireless indicator says you have a wireless network connection, while Firefox and Software Center say, you are not connected to the internet.

I don't want switch wallpapers manually every time.\n\nA: Using this bash script, you can achieve what you want.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ \"$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP\" = \"Unity\" ]\nthen\n  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri 'file:///usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png'\nelse\n  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri 'file:///usr/share/backgrounds/The_Grass_aint_Greener_by_fix_pena.jpg'\nfi\n\nAdd this script to Startup Applications (Add → Command sh path/to/script).\nAnd replace the file path to the background image you want.\n\nA: The script below sets wallpaper A for Unity session and wallpaper B Gnome ( or for any other desktop environment that has nautilus file manager running ).\nUsage is simple. Provide two full paths to images. First image is for Unity, second for anything else. \n./session_wallpapers.py  /home/user/WALLPAPERS/image_A.png /home/user/WALLPAPERS/image_B.jpg  \n\nThis can be added to Startup Applications to do the job automatically at login. Make sure that the script has executable permissions.\nIt also is available on my github repository. \nScript Source\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nfrom gi.repository import Gio,Notify\nimport dbus\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport time\n\n###########################################################\n# Author: Serg Kolo , contact: 1047481448@qq.com \n# Date:  June 30 , 2016\n# Purpose: set wallpaper depending on desktop session\n# Written for: https://askubuntu.com/q/146211/295286\n# Tested on: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS \n###########################################################\n# Copyright: Serg Kolo , 2016 \n#    \n#     Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software is hereby granted\n#     without fee, provided that  the copyright notice above and this permission statement\n#     appear in all copies.\n#\n#     THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n#     IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n#     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

That's interesting and sometimes effective, but inferior to other \"textual\" techniques.\nWhen I have lots of windows (which is when I need help finding them), the views provided by super-W and alt-tab often make the windows too small to recognize.  This leads to slow and annoying repeats of super-W or alt-tab.\nIn contrast, if it would display an icon with the name of the application (like \"firefox\", \"nautilus\", etc), that would be much more helpful.  Now, it is true that often we have multiple instances of an application running, so the behavior should work like this: only one \"firefox icon\", but then below the \"firefox icon\" there should be one more icon for each instance of the application (with text that indicates which instance, like filename, web-address, etc).\nIs there such an option or application?\n\nA: In CompizConfig Setting manager you can set overlay icons to the Scale windows plugin.\n\n\nYou can even set a keyboard shortcut to display windows from just one workspace or for a group of windows of the same applications in the Bindings tab of Scale plugin.\n\nPlus there are a lot of alternatives in the Window Management section, just discover them and choose to one suites you more.\n\n\nA: You can use the  ~ key to expand the icon while switching via alt+tab.\n\nA: Now, a more 'textual way' should be that:\n \nWindow-List applet is devloped by http://www.jameswigley.com/\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:jwigley/window-list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install window-list\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove or fix a node from maas after juju bootstrap?

I just installed StackApplet StackApplet 1.5 using the debian package from the launchpad site. When I first clicked on the preferences button in the menu it tried opening http://localhost:8150/ in Chromium, and I got this error:\nThis webpage is not available The webpage at http://localhost:8150/ might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.\nError 120 (net::ERR_SOCKS_CONNECTION_FAILED): Unknown error.\n\nMy Chromium is launched with a switch to make it use a socks5 proxy, using this command:\nchromium-browser  --proxy-server=\"socks5://localhost:1080\" %U\n\nI remembered that I wasn't using a bypass proxy URL list so I added the switch: --proxy-bypass-list=\"localhost,127.0.0.1\" to the above command and I was then able to access the preference page without any problems.\nHowever, after adding my account information I see the message: Network Error. in the StackApplet menu.  This makes me think that StackApplet might be trying to use the socks5 proxy--even though it is not set globally, only Chromium uses this proxy. I don't require StacksApplet to use my proxy, in fact it would probably be better if it didn't.

Still - if it works, that's great.\n\n\"What does the Network Error. message mean?\"\n\nThis error is displayed whenever the application receives a URLError exception from the urllib2 Python module. This can happen for a number of different reasons - including a misconfigured proxy.\n\n\"What should I do to fix/debug this error?\"\n\nThis is tricky.\nStackApplet isn't able to use either system-wide or Chromium-specific proxy settings. (In fact, being able to configure proxy settings for StackApplet has been a long-standing feature request.)\nWhat I would suggest is running StackApplet in a terminal.

I'm trying to buy a new Android phone and I own an Ubuntu 12.04 computer...\nI have the choice of a Google Galaxy Nexus, Samsung Galaxy S2 and an HTC Sensation XL.\nI am aware that the HTC already works with it, but I would prefer to buy the Samsung. I already have the phone hardware specifications and have checked, but I am not sure about the Samsung or the Nexus.\nSo which of these phones work with Ubuntu 12.04's 'Ubuntu for Android' feature?\n\nA: As mentioned on the Ubuntu for Android page, the product is marketed towards handset manufacturers rather than end users.  It is intended to be integrated into the firmware rather than act as an after market addition to existing phones.\nNone of the phones you've listed include the code in their firmware, and I don't think any have yet been released.\n\nA: You probably saw people run Ubuntu as a chroot or something, not the same thing.\nI would bet that if Ubuntu for Android ever gets released ports will be attempted to each of those phones by modders. The reason being that the code will be entirely free. The troublesome non-free graphics or camera drivers required by Android 4+ have more or less been available in Android 4 upgrades. Of course you would have to allow yourself to run as root first. The only problem, could be optimizing it for all these dual-core CPUs. In that list I think there are four different manufacturers involved, there are regional variants of the s2.\nIf you are serious about modding, the GN is made for that with an \"open\" chip architecture and simple boot-loader unlocking. Though, that said, there are a lot of modders for the s2 not so much the XL.\n\nA: In the future, Canonical will be working towards compatibility for all smartphones with quad-core processors according to the official Ubuntu for Android Page. If the Samsung Galaxy S2 has a processor like this, it will probably happen. But maybe just not as quickly as the others! So, you may have to wait in return for wanting it on such a phone, but there is no doubt that Ubuntu will work towards it.\nYou can also install Ubuntu on some devices.

Products such as Synology offer something called Synology Hybrid RAID\nhttp://www.synology.com/us/products/features/RAID.php\nThis RAID type allows you to make best use of your disks available by using all the disk space available as long as at least two disks share the same increased size where a typical RAID setup would simply \"throw away\" the extra space\nI would like to build a NAS with 4 disks available. I will begin by populating it with 3 X 3TB to give me 6TB usable. By the time I have filled this 6TB I imagine that 4TB disks will have come down in price, so at this stage I would add a 4th 4TB disk to give me an additional 3TB of space. When I next run out of space I will change one of the original 3TB disks with a 4TB disk giving me an additional 1TB of space. \nThis is not possible with a typical RAID configuration, only with these \"hybrid RAID\" types\nI am wondering if I can acheive a similar \"hybrid RAID\" with Ubuntu? or another linux distro?\n\nA: \nI am wondering if I can acheive a similar \"hybrid RAID\" with Ubuntu? or another linux distro?\n\nYes, you can using a combination of LVM and software raid (md).\n\nI will begin by populating it with 3 X 3TB to give me 6TB usable.\n\nOK, so you start with 3 disks in RAID 5 giving you 6 TB.\n\nso at this stage I would add a 4th 4TB disk\n\nOn this, create TWO partitions - 3TB and 1TB. As you stated, this will initially give a 4-disk RAID5 with 9 TB of space.\n\nWhen I next run out of space I will change one of the original 3TB disks with a 4TB disk giving me an additional 1TB of space. \n\nAgain, on this disk, create two partitions of 3TB and 1TB. Rebuild the RAID5 array onto the 1st partition. Then use mdadm to create a RAID-1 array from the two 1TB partitions on disks 3 and 4. Add this array to your logical volume, and voila! you have 10 TB of redundant storage.\nRinse and repeat :)\n", "Q: Xfce Volume adjusting sound applet for 12.04 Recently I upgraded the Mythbuntu 10.10 to 12.04 which uses Xfce, and realised there is no one click volume adjusting sound applet with a slider, like in 10.10.\nIs there something else to do this? Or is Xfce becoming even more minimalist?\n\nA: It's possible to use the standard GNOME volume control.\nIf you add gnome-sound-applet to your application startup list (it's in the Sessions and Startup settings dialogue in standard Xfce) then it will appear in the notifications area along with network-manager, dropbox and other applets.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install the xfce-volumed package. \n\n*Go to \"Add New Item\" menu of any panel, \n\n*then add \"Audio Mixer\".\n\nA: Also the volume control app may actually be apart of the Indicators plugin. Mine was and when I re-added the app it then brought my sound icon back.\n\nA: I believe the standard xfce sound control app on the task bar now works by way of the mouse wheel (or on my laptop the scrolling bit at the side of the finger mouse pad thing or whatever it's called), while the mouse pointer is over it? also I think I read that you can add a slider that appears when you click on it somehow.

Otherwise it just takes you to the gnome control panel when you try to get at the sound preferences.\n\nA: Followup to Chris Moore's answer:  use env instead of needlessly invoking a heavy bash shell:  \nenv XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME /usr/bin/gnome-sound-applet\n", "Q: How to change address and name of the computer in linux Ubuntu I have troubles again after upgrading Linux to version 12.04 - When I try to update progams and files with \"apt-get update\" it says something like there is no address added to your computer name.

This was not happening with 10.04, and each application windows had the corresponding input language set to its default or previous session every time I was bringing it to the foreground! \nHow will I make 12.04 to behave the same way? \n\nA: I opened System Settings, Keyboard Layout and Layouts. \nOn the right pane of that tab, I chose Allow different layouts for individual windows and that worked.\nNote: For Ubuntu 14.04 use System Settings, Text Entry\n\n", "Q: Stop using Development Release of Ubuntu Some time ago I updated my system to the development release of Ubuntu using these instructions:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/about-ubuntu/C/upgrade.html\n\"If you would like to install and test the latest development version of Ubuntu before it is released, press Alt+F2, type update-manager -c -d into the box and click Run.

All that is available for wubi installation is Ubuntu 12.04, but I strongly prefer 11.10.  Is there any way that I can use wubi installer for 11.10?\n\nA: 12.04 is recommended because it the latest release, but if you would like Wubi for 11.10, here is a direct link to the appropriate wubi.exe file.\nPlease note that Ubuntu 11.10 is only supported until April 2013, at which point you should upgrade if you are still using it for security reasons if nothing else.\n\nA: Wubi for Ubuntu 11.10 is available at http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.10/wubi.exe.\nYou can find all previous Ubuntu, Wubi and related files at http://releases.ubuntu.com/.\n", "Q: what packages to uninstall for better security? I have read a recommendation which was stating that after installing one should remove some packages from the default Ubuntu installation, in order to have a more secure server. What are your recommendations for removal?\n\nA: Ubuntu has a fairly strong security policy. This includes the requirement that a default install shouldn't run any network servers, listening for outside connections. As those are the cause for most recommendations to uninstall packages, the answer there is no.\nHowever, uninstalling anything you don't actually need will certainly help. It makes the system simpler and easier to understand, and probably reduces the probability of a privilege escalation, should anyone manage to breach the defences.\nPersonally, I uninstall everything that isn't used by me or the packages I use.\n\nA: The most important part is not what packages are installed, but which servers are running, especially those listening on an internet-facing port. Disabling or stopping servers which aren't used is an important first step. Offcourse -removing- such a service does serve as \"insurance\" that it doesn't get started accidentally somehow, so it might be a good idea.\nFor removal, the most obvious targets are any programs that come with suid-root executables, and aren't used. A bug in any of these programs will have the potential to allow any random local user to become root, that possibility goes away if you remove the program.\nYou can use 'find' to find such programs, in a terminal enter: find / -perm -4000 -print this will give you a list of all suid-programs on the system, it will take quite a bit of time with a large disc.\nThe mere existence of a program on disc which isn't suid-root, and that isn't being run, should not have any large impact on security. You might still want to remove some for other reasons such as freeing up disc-space and reducing clutter though.\n", "Q: Is updating via Update Manager equivalent to updating with apt-get? On my desktop (Precise) I have run System Settings > Details > Install Updates from the Unity desktop.  On my cloud server, also on Precise, I can use a VNC session to do the same but instead I have run apt-get update and apt-get upgrade.  \nWas my desktop activity equivalent to my server activity or is one of these measures less complete?  \n\nA: For more light into Update commands refer to the AptGet How-to:\nMaintenance commands\n1. apt-get update - Run this command after changing /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/preferences. For information regarding /etc/apt/preferences, see the Pinning How-to. Run this command periodically to make sure your source list is up to date. This is the equivalent of \"Reload\" in Synaptic or \"Fetch updates\" in Adept.\n2. apt-get upgrade - This command upgrades all installed packages. This is the equivalent of \"Mark all upgrades\" in Synaptic.\n3. apt-get dist-upgrade - The same as the above, except that it adds the \"smart upgrade\" checkbox. It tells APT to use \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary.  \nNote: apt-get dist-upgrade does not perform a distribution upgrade. See the upgrading page for more information.\n\nA: \nWas my desktop activity equivalent to my server activity\n\nMost of the time, yes, the desktop update is equal to apt-get update && apt-get upgrade.\nHowever, apt-get upgrade will not install packages like kernel upgrades that are optional but highly recommended, while Update Manager will. You have to use apt-get dist-upgrade for that, in which case you would have a true equivalent.\nIf you use apt-get upgrade and kernel upgrades, etc. are available, you will see a message like The following packages have been held back:; that's your cue to run apt-get dist-upgrade if you wish to upgrade those packages.\nNote that a number of types of cloud servers do not use their own kernel, but their physical \"host\" machine's kernel (OpenVZ, vserver, LXC, Xen paravirtualized); other types behave like physical machines themselves (Xen HVM, KVM).\n", "Q: Programmaticaly change lightdm autologin session type I have problem with lightdm setting autologin session type (using my config tool).

What are the reasons and alternatives to the removal of Vim from a default Ubuntu installation since Oneiric 11.10?\n\nA: I think most desktop user use nano or gedit... if you install Ubuntu Server vim is still installed by default.\nIf you type vim on a 12.04 desktop you get:\n\nThe program 'vim' can be found in the following packages:\n * vim\n * vim-gnome\n * vim-tiny\n * vim-athena\n * vim-gtk\n * vim-nox\n\nTry installing any of these with sudo apt-get install <selected package>\n\nA: Usually, packages are removed from the default installation due to space constraint. CDs are limited ( and so does DVD ), and there is pressure to add more translations, to support more hardware ( especially with big binary blobs like the Nvidia driver ), etc.\nSo usually, packagers take a look at what can be safely removed ( ie, without removing important use case of a default distribution ). In the case of vim, there is already gedit and nano to fill the position and I would say that people who use vim are able to install it from the archive without much problem.\n\nA: You can install the vim editor simply by typing sudo apt-get install vim  in terminal.\nGood alternatives for vim are nano,the vi editor or if you prefer a GUI experience rather than terminal you can use gedit which is installed by default or a more simple editor like leafpad,or the GTK+ version of vim which you get with sudo apt-get install vim-gtk\n", "Q: How can I change power options to make my system \"always on\"?

I've read some posts but it seems to be ages ago and non-relevant.\n\nThe gist of the panic from the screenshot is:\nVFS: cannot open root device sda1\nPlease append correct root= boot option\nAvailable partitions are: sr0 only\nKernel panic: VFS: unable to mount root fs\n\n\nNever had problems before. In fact, Linux always ran better on the VM than the MS-win7.  I'm not such a linux expert - nooB treatment would be preferred :-D\nEDIT:\nPhysical System:\n\n\n*\n\n*i5 2.66 quad, 12 GB ram\n\n*Graphic card (sux) nVidia 210\n\n*OS, win7 Ultimate.\n\n\nI've tried installing the VM toolkit, so I can gain some extra features, but it didn't succeed as well, so my guess is nothing was installed.\nThe console output when TRYing 2 boot on recovery mode:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/7vgz3vw5kyv5n9f/M1Ifv0rOtM\n@izx, What am I suppose to do with it? :-) What do I need to do to fix the sda1 device? Is this a VM issue? Should I need to copy the settings as appeared on the previous version?\nEdit \nTried to run update-initramfs as @psusi suggested, but got another error.\nApparently, my /lib/modules/3.2.0.24-generic has nothing in it.\nI tried copying the modules.dep from another kenrnel (previous 1) but nothing.\nHere's the console output.\nDismissed, final solution:\nfresh install.\n\nA: It looks like your new kernel is missing its initramfs.  If you can boot the old kernel, then run sudo update-initramfs to generate one.\n", "Q: No wifi Internet with Ubuntu 12.04 Im with Ubuntu 12.04 - Dell Inspiron 5110 (8g ram, i7 cpu). When I connect to a router at my place, i get an internal IP i can ping others in the network (and the router), but have no internet. I trided by checking with trough FF, IE and Opera and couldn't load any pages. I read all other similar topics and nothing helped.\n\nA: Check if DHCP server is giving you nameservers.\nIn terminal window type:\ncat /etc/resolv.conf\n\nMy resolv.conf: \n# Generated by NetworkManager\nnameserver 192.168.0.1\n\nIf not, the simply solution is adding nameservers by hand.\nHowever, if you experience this, you have a problem in DHCP Server.\n\nA: This sounds exactly like a DNS problem. In order to really fix your problem though you really out to have stated what desktop environment you are using because some desktop environments like KDE have their own slutions to problems like this. Since you didn't state which one you are using I'm going to assume you are using Unity(since it's already installed by default).\nFirst off, check with any other program that you have installed uses the internet, like a game etc. and see if that program/game can indeed access the internet. If it can even though Internet browsers \"cannot\", it might even be as simple as a proxy being set on when you don't need to use a proxy. In your browsers settings try turning off proxys and see if that solves the issue.\nIf not, then it could in fact be a DNS problem. I suggest opening the Terminal and type: dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf and see if that solves your problem.\n", "Q: Evolution data migration (on update) missed all but the first \"accounts\" (mail, addressbook, calendar...) Due to a system crash, I had to do a fresh install on a new computer. Luckily my harddisk was not affected -- but unfortunately the \"good old 8.04\" didn't want to boot from it on the new system...\nSo with 12.04 installed on a fresh harddisk, I copied all evolution folders from the old disk to the corresponding locations (~/.evolution plus ~/.gconf/apps/evolution -- the old Evo on 8.04 had no ~/.local/share/evolution), and started the app. The migration assistant popped up, and I went through -- but in the end, only one of my \"accounts\" in each category was migrated and available: local mail, one of 4 IMAP accounts (though data of all 4 accounts where moved to ~/.local/share/evolution), one of 4 address books, and so on.\nNot a big deal for the IMAP stuff, as I just had to configure it (data are stored on the server in this case). But how can I get my addressbooks back? As described above, starting the \"old installation\" to export those data is not an option, as the old system cannot be started anymore. Is there a way to fire the migration assistant for a given dataset (in my case: tell it to just migrate-and-import a single specified addressbook)?\n\nA: The above PHP got me started.  But I had problems with junk in the cards.\nI am a Python guy, so I wrote a new program in Python.  I used Python 2.x to run this.\nThis uses a Python dictionary to keep track of email addresses already seen from address cards, and it only stores a given address once.  This solved another problem I had, of duplicate card records.\nI think the binary junk between the cards was used by Evolution to figure out which cards were valid.  This program just uses a couple of rules of thumb: if a card has garbage binary characters in it, or isn't properly terminated, or doesn't have an email address in it, it's a bad card and goes in the \"bad\" output file.\nAfter you are done converting, you can check the \"bad\" output file and see if there is anything in there that isn't in the .vcf output file.  In my case, there wasn't; this program got all the good cards for me.\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport re\nimport sys\n\ndef bad_chars():\n    for n in range(0, 32):\n        if n not in (9, 10, 13):\n            yield chr(n)\n    for n in range(128, 256):\n        yield chr(n)\n\ndef has_bad(s):\n    return any(ch in s for ch in bad_chars())\n\ndef get_email(card):\n    lst = card.split('\\n')\n    for line in lst:\n        if \"EMAIL\" in line:\n            _, _, email = line.partition(':')\n            return email.strip()\n    else:\n        return ''\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 4:\n    print(\"Usage: cvt.py <input_old_address_book> <output.vcf> <bad.txt>\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n\nwith open(sys.argv[1], \"rb\") as in_f:\n    s = in_f.read()\n\ns_start = \"BEGIN:VCARD\"\ns_end = \"END:VCARD\"\n\ncards = {}\nlst_bad = []\n\nwhile s:\n    i_start = s.find(s_start)\n    if i_start == -1:\n        break\n\n    i_next = s.find(s_start, i_start + len(s_start))\n    if i_next == -1:\n        i_next = len(s) - 1\n\n    i_end = s.find(s_end, i_start + len(s_start))\n    if i_end == -1:\n        i_end = len(s) - 1\n    else:\n        i_end += len(s_end)\n\n    if i_next < i_end:\n        i_end = i_next\n\n    card = s[i_start:i_end+1].strip()\n    s = s[i_end:]\n\n    card = card.replace('\\r', '')\n    card = card.replace('\\0', '')\n    if not card:\n        continue\n\n    key = get_email(card)\n    if has_bad(card) or s_end not in card or not key:\n        lst_bad.append(card)\n        continue\n\n    if key not in cards or len(card) > len(cards[key]):\n        cards[key] = card\n\nwith open(sys.argv[2], \"w\") as out_f:\n    for key in sorted(cards.keys()):\n        out_f.write(cards[key] + \"\\n\\n\")\n\nwith open(sys.argv[3], \"w\") as bad_f:\n    for s in lst_bad:\n        bad_f.write(s + \"\\n\\n\")\n\n\nA: Digging in a bit deeper, I figured two things: While the new database format is SQLite3, the old was some binary storing VCARDs which where clearly readable. So I came up with a small PHP snippet:\n#!/usr/bin/php\n<?php\n# -=[ UserConf ]=-\n$evodb = 'addressbook.db'; // (path and) name to the old address database\n$name  = 'business';       // name of the address book (used as filename)\n$separate_vcards = FALSE;  // if TRUE, each VCARD will go to a separate file\n\n#-=[ Do not touch below lines ]=-\n$re_vcard = '!(BEGIN:VCARD.*?END:VCARD)!ims';\n\n$evo = file_get_contents($evodb);\npreg_match_all($re_vcard,$evo,$vcards);\n$cards = count($vcards[1]);\n$new = '';\nfor ($i=0;$i<$cards;++$i) {\n  if ($separate_vcards) {\n    file_put_contents(\"${name}_${i}.vcf\",$vcards[1][$i]);\n  } else {\n    $new .= $vcards[1][$i] . \"\\n\\n\";\n  }\n}\nif (!$separate_vcards) file_put_contents(\"${name}.vcf\",$new);\n?>\n\nThis is not 100% perfect, but better than losing all those data. The script runs through the old-style database, and tries to fetch all VCARDs stored there. Those are either exported to separate files (each VCARD in one file, if $separate_vcards = TRUE), or to one collection (otherwise).\nAs those are supposed to be plain-text files, one can check them and correct them easily (line-breaks, binary garbage) -- and finally using Evolutions Import-Feature (found in the \"File\" menu) to import the data (\"single file\") into an existing addressbook (create an empty one before if you want a new addressbook).\nFor me this restored about 90% of my addresses fine. For the remaining 10%, some where mixed-up or broken (remember, even the old format was binary -- and the snippet just works in \"ASCII mode\").\nHope this helps somebody else (if so, don't forget to up-vote this solution).\n", "Q: How to create a deb package that installs a series of files I would like to create a brand new deb package to install series of files.  If at all possible, I would like to untar the folder containing these files as part of the installation into a known folder location.  Failing that, some knowledge how to package the source folders and files would be very useful.\nQuestion is - is this possible and if so - how?\nLets give an example:\n~/mypluginfolder/ contains the files x, y, a subfolder called abc and inside that another file called z.\nI want to tar this folder: tar -cvf myfiles.tar ~/mypluginfolder\nI presume my debian package would look like\nmyfiles.tar.gz\nmyfiles+ppafoss_0.1-1/\n   myfiles.tar\n   DEBIAN\n      changelog, compat, control, install, rules source\n\nIs it possible to somehow untar myfiles.tar to a known folder location for example\n/usr/share/rhythmbox/plugins/\n\nThus the final result would be:\n/usr/share/rhythmbox/plugins/mypluginfolder\n/usr/share/rhythmbox/plugins/mypluginfolder\\x\n/usr/share/rhythmbox/plugins/mypluginfolder\\y\n/usr/share/rhythmbox/plugins/mypluginfolder\\abc\\z\n\nIf - presuming launchpad needs source, advice is sought as to where I should drop the source folders and files into the deb package structure.\n\nThis will eventually will become a series of individual launchpad PPA packages.\nWhat I prefer (but may not be able to achieve...) is to keep my packaging to a minimum - create a series of packages from a template and adjust the bare minimum (changelog etc + the tar file/file & folder structure).\n\nA: Below, I'm assuming that the source is open (e.g. Python scripts) which are therefore not bound to any architecture (e.g. amd64 or i386), hence \"all\". If you have some C source, you need to use Architecture: amd64 i386 in your source control file.\n\ncreating package ready for Launchpad\n\nThis will eventually will become a series of individual launchpad PPA packages.\nWhat I prefer (but may not be able to achieve...) is to keep my packaging to a minimum - create a series of packages from a template and adjust the bare minimum (changelog etc + the tar file).\n\nLaunchpad only accepts source packages, so create a rules that installs the files in the correct places. For convenience, I'll use debhelper. The directory with your files should look like:\ndebian/changelog\ndebian/control\ndebian/rules\ndebian/compat\nmypluginfolder/...\n\nA debian/copyright file may also be useful for informing users about the licenses associated with the package. I don't think you need a postinst script since you only need to extract some files. compat should contain the debhelper compatilbility level, say \"8\". (please refer to the manual page of debhelper for more details)\nThe changelog file can be edited with the dch command, available from the devscripts package. The rules (using debhelper) should contain:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n%:\n    dh $@\noverride_dh_install:\n    dh_install mypluginfolder/ /usr/share/rhythmbox/plugins\n\nMake it executable using chmod 755 debian/rules. A source package can be build using debuild -S. Be sure to be in a directory named <package-name>-<version>. More information about the override_ behavior and the dh command can be found on its manual page.\nThe Debian New Maintainers' Guide was very valuable for me to understand this, it's recommended reading. Example packaging can be found on https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bumblebee-ppa.\n\ncreating package from existing file tree\ndpkg-deb -b can be used for creating tarballs from an existing file tree. First, start with creating a directory that should be named after your package. I'll assume you want to name it myplugin, and put it in /usr/share/rhythmbox/plugins/mypluginfolder. In addition, create the DEBIAN directory (uppercase!) for storing package information:\nmkdir -p myplugin/usr/share/rhythmbox/plugins/mypluginfolder\nmkdir myplugin/DEBIAN\n\nCopy over your files:\ncp -r ~/mypluginsfolder myplugin/usr/share/rhythmbox/plugins\n\nNext, you'll need a so-called control file located at myplugin/DEBIAN/control which describes the package. The contents of such a file are put below:\nPackage: myplugin\nVersion: 1.0-1\nMaintainer: You <whatever@contact.address>\nArchitecture: all\nDescription: plugins for Rhythmbox\n Longer description here\n .\n As you can see, new paragraph are split by a single dot,\n and lines have to be indented by one space.\n\nNow, you can optionally verify the contents of your package. The next command lists the file and directory entries contents of myplugin:\nfind myplugin -ls\n\nIf you're satisfied, build the package in the current directory:\ndpkg-deb -b myplugin .\n\nA new file will appear, named like <package>_<version>_<architecture>.deb which is in this example myplugin_1.0-1_all.deb. You can use the less program to peek in the file. For example, less myplugin_1.0-1_all.deb.\n", "Q: Confusion with system clock change in messages? In the messages log I can see that my system clock was changed. This was recorded in the log happening at 4pm and the change was to move the system clock to 3.58pm. However, in the next lines of the log they are still recorded as happening at 4pm and not the new time the system clock was changed to - surely the events following should be recorded at the new system clock time?\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: As far as I know the system clock is adjusted with small incremental updates until the correct time is reached.\n"]
