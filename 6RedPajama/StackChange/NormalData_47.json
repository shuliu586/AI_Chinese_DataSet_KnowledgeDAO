["Q: Delete hidden books from iTunes I'm cleaning up my iTunes library. I'm a programmer so, with the help of some nifty scripting, I'm using iTunes Music Library.xml to give me improved insight into my iTunes library.\nIn the process, I've discovered there are several books lingering in my library which I can't see in the iTunes application. I've also found the book files sitting in iTunes Media.\nI can't for the life of me figure out how to delete these books from my library, considering I can't find them in the application. Any ideas?\nNote: I'm running iTunes 12.3.2.35 on Windows 10. My library was moved from an old Mac (packed away but can dig it out if software version numbers available if required).\n\nA: SELF ANSWER:\nOn Windows, books should have been available from the iTunes application but, for whatever reason, they weren't for me. So, I ended up moving my iTunes library back to a Mac running OS X 10.11.\nOn OS X, it appears that all books functionality has been moved from iTunes to the iBooks application. I opened iBooks and it immediately offered to move books from iTunes. I then deleted the books from iBooks. After closing both iTunes and iBooks, an inspection of iTunes Music Library.xml shows that all the books \"tracks\" have been removed from my iTunes library.\n", "Q: How do I prevent Apple Watch from silencing my phone's vibration on notifications? I've got an Apple Watch, and because haptic feedback is physically disturbing me, I've turned it off. However, I'm getting all notifications on the watch but my phone is not vibrating on a notification, but I do want it to vibrate.\nHow do I get my phone notifications back?\n\nA: That's not possible. The notifications will be displayed in one or another, but never in both devices.\nIf you want notifications back in your phone, you have to turn it off in your watch.\n\nA: The Watch is designed to handle all the notifications on the phone, without the phone having to give any alerts. The only exception to this would be for phone calls, when the iPhone either rings or vibrates, as well as the Watch. The only way for you to get your phone to vibrate on some notifications is to customize the notification settings on the Watch to only show the notifications you want on the Watch--e.g., Messages, Mail, and Calendar--while turning off all other notifications. If you do this, a notification from Twitter will vibrate the phone, but not the Watch. \n", "Q: Error 53 makes my sister's iPhone 6 brick Little did I know, my sister had encountered an issue that Apple bricks her iPhone, after she repaired her iPhone 6 by a non-Apple technician.\nLater, I hear reports that iOS 9.2 restore fails if it detects that a repair has been carried out by a non-Apple technician. I also know that this is a touch ID related problem.I have to advise her to ask Apple support team for help.\nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: Because the iPhone was serviced by a third-party, the phone is bricked. Apple will issue an out of warranty replacement, but it will be quite expensive. (It is an out of warranty replacement because the technician voided the warranty when he replaced internal components.)\nApple is not just doing this for fun. It keeps your biometric data secure. If someone at the mall, for example, replies your Touch ID sensor with another one, he can gain access to the iPhone and your information is not secure. While it may be frustrating, there is a good reason it happens.\n\nA: Error 53 can be corrected if it's a software issue. Apple documents this quite well and what to do online:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205628\n\n\n*\n\n*Update iTunes\n\n*Force restart the device and attempt a restore of the device\n\n*Have an Apple authorized service agent or Apple repair the hardware\n\n\n\nIt's likely someone tampered with the touch sensor if you have a hardware issue and Apple will let you know if it's covered under warranty when you seek service. I would make a backup before you try the restore just in case it works / erases your data.\nAdditionally, Apple's article now states that error 53 was intended for factory diagnostics and updating the device to iOS 9.2.1 or later will remedy this behavior.\nYou don't get touch ID back, but the device works just as it did after the repair/damage and before you tried to restore the phone. No data loss is enforced by this update.\n\nA: I recently ran into a Home Button issue after a display change so I was curious about if my phone would be bricked with the next update. According to my research, Apple is no longer bricking phones (there was a lawsuit on this issue) after a home button change. The only thing that fails to work is the touch ID sensor. The touch ID sensor is always paired to the original phone.\n", "Q: How to Show Virtual Keyboard in El Capitan? I changed to El Capitan and I cannot find anymore the virtual keyboard about testing keyboard's keys visually. \nIt is normally in the right hand corner under the keyboard switcher icon. \nI need the tool to review specific characters of OS X Keyboards, since I am typing many of them. \nHow can you have the virtual keyboard in OS X El Capitan?\n\nA: System Prefs > Keyboard > Keyboard > Show Keyboard, Emoji & Symbol viewers in menu bar.\n\n\nA: in my case when i checked \"show keyboard- and character bla bla\" nothing happens what so ever. No onscreen-keyboard?? I also run El Capitan... \nah never mind, my mistake. It's Yosemite i do run, not El Capitan. but still there's no keyboard Viewer showing?\nSOLUTION 4 SHOWING THE ONSCREEN-KEYBOARD:\nmove mouse to upper part of the screen and right-click the language flag icon to actually show the onscreen-keyboard.\n", "Q: Wifi not working after Bootcamp setup So I just used Bootcamp to install the Windows 10 technical preview and all was working well until I couldn't find the Wi-fi settings. I have trawled through everything and it seems to be a problem with my drivers. (I could not find BC support software from Apple for Windows 10). I have no idea why I can't connect to the internet on windows and no idea on how to fix it. If you look up the issue on the internet there always seems to be something that they have that I don't (Such as a WINSTALL Drive.\nHelp would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Basically, Apple does not support running Windows 10 on Macs older than the 2012 models. This does mean you can not run Windows 10 on an older model, just that you are on your own to figure out how.\nWindows is designed to use older drivers when newer ones can not be found. The drivers for Apple hardware is included in the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" (BCSS). If Apple did not supply Windows 10 BCSS for your Mac, you should use latest available BCSS that Apple documents is designed for your Mac.\nOne myth I put to test was: \"Downloading the BCSS using the Boot Camp \nAssistant will produce newer software than directly downloading from the internet\". I have iMac (21.5\" mid 2011) running OS X 10.11.3. I used the Boot Camp Assistant to download the BCSS for Windows 8.1 to a flash drive. I also directly downloaded the BCSS for Windows 7 from Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621. I then used Windiff.exe to compare both downloads. They were identical. I am not saying this is true for all Macs, it just happened to be true for mine.\nTo install the BCSS after Windows is installed, open the BootCamp folder and execute the setup.exe application. If setup.exe will not execute, right click on the icon and select Trouble compatibility.\n\nA: You didn't install the drivers: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204990 and http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/13/9147657/apple-boot-camp-windows-10\n\nA: I had the same issue, even with all the latest Apple drivers. This video helped me. It's just toggling one preference, and you're good. Very simple, but it should've worked out the box, so to speak.\n", "Q: Why have my apps from the store suddenly started exiting with code 173? My iMac is running current OS/X Yosemite 10.11.3. It's a big development machine, not rebooted for some weeks. It has many apps from the Mac app store, among them TextWrangler and Clocks. Suddenly (it worked yesterday) TextWrangler wouldn't launch. The listing from Console showed \n2016/02/16 11:12:38.116 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.barebones.textwrangler.64672[94023]) Service exited with abnormal code: 173\n\nand it wouldn't do anything else until I threw it in the trash and re-downloaded it from the app store. Then I noticed Clocks wasn't running (it, too, worked yesterday). It gave the same error code 173 and was fixed by re-downloading.\nI see from Why do App Store applications transferred into ~/Applications on another machine not launch? that error 173 is caused by the app receipt being invalid.\nIs there some reason why receipts for some of my apps from the store would suddenly become invalid?\n\nA: Yesterday (February 14, 2016), one of the Mac App Store certificates expired and it also was the deadline for developers to include a new intermediate certificate in their app signing chain. The former causes the receipt validation code used by many apps to fail and the latter is the longer term \"cure\"\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=02092016a\nDevelopers were emailed at least two times about this change but didn't have a lot of time to submit apps for review - based on the time it typically takes a review for a Mac App Store update to get processed even if it's approved on the first submission.\nUsers need to launch each one of their MAS apps while connected to the internet to renew intermediate certificates or deal with apps that need to be re-downloaded.\nAn app with an invalid receipt should exit with a special code (173), which informs OS X to present a Sign in to use this application on this computer dialog.\nHowever, a separate bug in OS X can prevent this dialog from appearing. In this case, users will see an app which simply exits on launch. (Console.app reports that the app is exiting with code 173, but OS X forgets to show the dialog).\nTwo scenarios that you should be aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you usually use an app from a location without Internet access, make sure that you launch the app to revalidate it before you head out.\n\n*If a app is crashing at launch and not showing you the dialog, you've hit an OS X bug. Deleting the app and re-downloading the app from the store should fix the issue.\n\n\nHorrible situation that Apple is very aware of.\n", "Q: New version of Macbook Pro If this is off-topic let me know and I will delete.\nI want to buy a new Macbook Pro, but I don't know if it better to wait to a new version or to buy now the last version.\nWhen Apple should announce the new Macbook Pro?\n\nA: No-one really knows for certain when Apple are going to release new hardware except for Apple. So any answer is likely to be opinion-based which might get your question deleted.\nThat said, some sites online try to give an informed guess by analysing previous release schedules. For example, MacRumors who currently recommend against buying a Macbook Pro as they believe a new release is imminent.\nhttp://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Retina_MacBook_Pro\nBut like I said, this is just guesswork.\n\nA: Well, apple usualy releases new macbooks arround October-December. It depends which one you are imterested in the 13\" or the 15\" if you are looking at the 13\" one there isnt actually that much to update for apple, it allready has the newer GpU and CPU, virtually the fastest PCI-e flash storage, only update could be CPU (Skylake) and possibly a new GPU, but the difference won't be dramatical at all. If you are looking at 15\" model you could see significant update in GPU (small one in dedicated GPU and a bigger one in integrated GPU) and a bigger update in CPU since the current model still uses 2 generations old Haswell, it should be updated with skylake this year, but that is months and months away. If you are asking will there be any dramatical redesigns like there was eith the release of retina macbook pro, I dont think so, that should be atleast 1, 1,5 year from now.\nThats all the rummors there are out there for now.\n\nA: I was doing the same thing when Apple was bringing out its new Macbook.  Be aware that the refurbished MBPs will go on a very good sale in the 2 weeks before their new versions come out.  I ended up buying a 13\" MBP with 16Gb ram /256 SSD for about $500 off.  Very similar to the refreshed models that came out, but a lot more affordable. :)\n", "Q: Why are the insert options grayed out when I open a PDF? in Preview, I opened up a PDF containing an image. I need to combine it with a portion of another such PDF. When opened, it was locked, so I duplicated it. However, the insert sub-options remain grayed out, so I can't add a page. Is there a way?\n\nA: The files I was opening were JPG, not PDF, and even though my intention was to create PDF files, apparently I'd need to first save one as a PDF and then open it to insert another page.\n", "Q: I am trying to disable Game Center on El Capitan How do I disable, delete, or hide Game Center on El Capitan?\nI have already tried Terminal deletion, but to no avail.\n\nA: To disable Game Center on Mac OS X:\nOpen Game Center. In the menu bar, select Account > Sign Out. If you don't want to sign out, you can instead click Account > Settings, then uncheck \"Allow Invites\", \"Nearby Players\", \"Contacts\", and \"Facebook\". After you've done one or both of these two things, go to System Preferences > Notifications > Game Center > Game Center alert style > None.\n", "Q: Insert accented letters in passwords This should be easy, but I cannot solve it by myself.\nHow can I insert accented letters in passwords?\nWhen I go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Change Password... and in the password field for instance I hold the letter u, it won't show the list of possible accented letters, it just repeats the u. \nIf I use Alt+u to get the placeholder for ü (so that I can type u to get it with the umlaut), it won't show the \"insert a letter now\" yellow placeholder, instead I get a beep. The same goes for Alt+i, Alt+n, Alt+e, only beeps and no possibility to enter an accented letter.\nMoreover, if I enable the \"Show emoji and symbols\" as in the picture below, I am able to insert symbols in the hint, but in the password it is completely prohibited. \nThe same goes with \"Show keyboard viewer\" and try to insert with Alt+e|u|i|n to be able to finally enter euin to get the symbols éüîñ, I get a beep. The only accent that sort of works is the backtick Alt+backtick, but it inserts the backtick itself without prompting for the letter to be accented.\n\nInput source: US English\nOS X version: El Capitan 10.11.3 (15D21)\nIs there a way?\nPS. By the way, when changing passwords, can I tell my Mac to stop asking this? \"Would you like to change the password for “username”, or begin using your iCloud password to log in and unlock this Mac?\"\n\nA: Entering a password with a diacritic works as expected. You have to use the proper keys though:\nTo enter an umlaut you have to use altU\nTo enter an accent grave you have to use alt`\nTo enter an accent acute you have to use altE\nTo enter an accent circumflex you have to use altI\nTo enter a tilde you have to use altN \nThe above are all dead keys and have to be followed by a second key. If you enter space the diacritic itself is the \"entered sign\". Entering a dead key in a password field you neither get the typical yellow/orange dead key indicator nor a bullet - you get a beep only!\nThe back tick itself is no accent (dead key) but simply a back tick.\nE.g. to enter an ü using an US English input source and an Apple keyboard with a (physical) US English layout you first have to hit altU and then U again.\nIn my virtual machine I get an alert sound but no bullet after entering the first key combination (the dead key ¨) and then after entering the second (single) U a new bullet. The resulting letter is the (lower caps) ü.\n\nBTW the ¨ is no accent. Like accents it's a diacritic though.\n\nA: Perhaps not a fully security bullet proof solution but definitely the simplest and quickest one.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open any location where you can type in normal text\n\n*Type your password including the special characters\n\n*Select password, Cmd-C for copy\n\n*Go to the password dialog, Cmd-V for paste\n\n\nIf you want to do this in the login window, you could do the same however there are few extra steps to be taken:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences / Users & Groups / Login Options\n\n*Display login window as: Name and password\n\n*Log out\n\n\nNow you have 2 textboxes; one for the login name, one for the password.  You can now use the same trick as the one I described above.  Small issue though; the system doesn't show the clickable accent-options assist box though.  They do work however.  (for example try pressing 'e' for 2 seconds, then press '2' and the é should show up in the textbox) \n", "Q: Digitizer assembly replacement and Error 53 As you probably know, Error 53 is Apple intentionally bricking your iDevice due to a 3rd-party repairing it, or specifically changing the TouchID sensor.\nIf I merely change the screen (LCD, digitizer, and glass) and detach the TouchID sensor from the old screen and reattach the same sensor to the new screen, could this potentially cause Error 53?\n\nA: Apple has released a fixed version of iOS 9.2 (specifically 9.2.1 and later) which will restore the device to operation.\nIt doesn't fix the touch sensor - but you can use the device.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205628\nAlso see:\nError 53 makes my sister's iPhone 6 brick\nSo - if you disturb/tamper with the touch sensor - you won't brick the device when updating from iTunes (as opposed to an OTA update which doesn't throw error 53 for iOS 9.2 and lower), but the sensor won't work going forward.\n\nA: If anything is done to the Touch ID sensor, welcome to Error 53. Take your iPhone to the Genius Bar for repair. It's not cheap, but it's cheaper than buying a new iPhone.\n", "Q: How to secure my mail in iOS? Can you please advise what is the best application for email encryption using iPhones and iPads?\n\nA: It depends on the level of security you are looking for. For PGP, some options, as explained in this article, are iPGMail and oPenGP. If you are looking for a simpler option, in which you don't want to rely on the PGP web of trust, then you can use S/MIME in the stock mail app with little effort. The linked article explains the easiest way to do this on iOS. \n", "Q: Airdrop not working Occasionaly I need to transfer files between laptops (when I don't have internet for example). Through my experience Airdrop actually worked less than 5% of the time, the other 95% the devices never show up on each other airdrop finder window. Not even after I connected both computers to the same router.\nI find it extremely unreliable! I have 3 Apple devices at home: a Mid-2014 15inch MBP, a Early-2015 13inch MBP and an iPad Air2.\nThe laptops were 10 cm apart, both wireless were turned on and even with the iPad no device was showing up. I am wondering what am I doing wrong?\nEven at work when trying to use airdrop between coworkers' laptops no laptop was showing up on Airdrop.\nI live fine without Airdrop as I almost always have internet, but I would like for it to work in the rare occasions that I am offline.\n\nA: AirDrop is very hit and miss. Sometimes, it can work consistently for a day, other times, it won't work for a week. I have issues with it all the time. I'm hoping this gets resolved in iOS 10 and OS X 10.12 this fall. \n\nA: As ComputerScienceStudent said, AirDrop is indeed very finicky.\nCheck your visibility status. I forget this more often than I'd like, but it happens. Ensure that your visibility status is not set to \"Contacts Only\" but set to \"Everyone\". This can be done on an iDevice by heading to Control Center and ensuring that AirDrop at the bottom is set to \"Everyone\" or on a Mac, ensuring that \"Allow me to be discovered by\" is set to \"Everyone\".\n\n", "Q: iPhone 6 Plus battery reduced to a fourth of what it was recently I have an iPhone 6 Plus - Bought the Plus size because I could really do with a better battery.\nThe battery used to be excellent earlier - lasting upto 2 days on one full charge\nThe phone is barely 3 months old, but all of a sudden since last week, the battery drains real fast and the device is hot most of the time - I reset the device, turned of the Location service and the background apps and all such general things.\nHere is a screenshot of a fully charged phone at 4 PM discharged to 50% at 8 PM with barely any use meanwhile.\n\nI suspect this to be a hardware issue. Any way I can prove this? Unfortunately, here in India Apple care centres hardly help and just take away your phone for weeks, wipe it and return it as it is.\nCan I request a hardware diagnostic to Apple Care on phone, that I can execute?\n\nA: iOS 9 lets you see exactly what's using battery over the past day and the past week.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Battery\n\n*Wait for the list to populate\n\n*Tap \"Show detailed usage\" to see a breakdown of foreground and background usage for each process\n\n*Switch between \"Last 24 Hours\" and \"Last 7 Days\" to see what might have changed for you 2 days ago.\n\n\nFor much more on this feature, including some advice on how to make sense of the data, see http://www.imore.com/how-see-whats-using-battery-life-your-iphone-or-ipad\n", "Q: Redirect to different machine with Server App I am running my main website (e.g. main.com) on a MacMini Server with OS X 10.10 and Server App Version 4. In addition, I serve a Django powered web app on a Raspberry Pi using Gunicorn and nginx. Now, I like to make the web app available from a subdomain (e.g. webapp.main.com) or alternatively from a different path like main.com/webapp.\nI understand that the requests on port 80 will be handled by the web server on the MacMini. So it's a matter of redirecting the request from there to the Raspberry Pi server. How can I do this redirect or is my setup maybe too messy?\n\nA: OS X Server uses Apache which is a very flexible application.  OS X Server does provide you with the ability to setup redirects (https://help.apple.com/serverapp/mac/5.0/#/apd1AB74EDF-C5B3-4C20-AD02-42120FF3B208)  If those settings are not sufficient and you are willing to tackle apache configuration files, there are additional options available to you.\nTutorial on Apache Redirects (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-temporary-and-permanent-redirects-with-apache-and-nginx)\nIf you do a google search for \"Apache configuration redirect\" you'll find a lot more information on the topic.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly you don't have to involve redirection.

After reading recommendations online, I bought an LG IPS monitor to go with my MacBook Pro Retina. But things, specially type, look blurry on it. Is there a monitor out there that can deliver the same sharpness as my retina display? Could I have the wrong setting?\n\nA: Nothing is going to look as good as a Retina display. If your display seems like it should be sharper make sure you are running that display at it's native resolution. Scaling the display to non-native resolutions can make even the best monitor look pretty bad.\nThat said I run my MacBook Pro's retina display at it's maximum resolution of 1900 X 1200 because it still looks sharp to my old eyes, even with scaling on.\n", "Q: Clear large .MobileBackups files/folder?

You should try to re download the installation file from the App Store and/or try some other method to put the installer on the USB.\n\nA: I had same issue on MacBook Pro 2007, actually this is oldest MBP that could run OS X 10.11.\nAfter trying different solutions I had to boot up from current system, connect new empty HDD (actually it was SSD, but HDD will work too) and started install from downloaded application then chose new HDD as installation source and swaped disks after installation.\nHopes this helps.\n\nA: If your machine is quite old you may first need to reinstall the copy of Lion / Mountain Lion that came with your machine, then upgrade to El Capitan using either your bootable USB stick, or just by using the normal Apple Store process.\nFollow the Apple article Create a bootable installer for OSX to create a bootable USB stick from a freshly-downloaded copy of El Capitan. \n\nA: I'm having the same problem on my MacPro(3,1) Early 2008, except my progress bar gets to about 55%. In verbose mode, it shows it's hanging at a DSMOS / Bluetooth error indefinitely. I suspect I may need to instead create a bootable Mountain Lion, or even Leopard image on my USB. I just dropped $1k on new memory and an SSD PCI Mercury Accelsior, so I'm not giving up yet on this 2008. lol\n\nA: After failing to install the OS using multiple USB drives and slots, I was lucky enough to find an old OSX installation disk in the IT department at work and was able to install the OS. \n", "Q: How can I start a new text on my iphone message app? I can't seem to find a way to start a new text thread on my Iphone, does anyone know how to do that without deleting the entire contact, and then re-entering it?\n\nA: I'm assuming you mean just starting a new message thread...Choose the icon in the upper right corner. It has what looks like a pencil drawing on paper. If you are referring to starting a new thread with a person with whom you already have a thread, you cannot have two active threads with the same person. \n\nA: You can start a new thread by creating a group text including yourself as a recipient, but this will only work once.\n", "Q: Notes has Google Notes. But Google has no such service. Where are they stored? If you go to System Preferences -> Internet Accounts and add a Google account, you can see Google has Notes. If you open Notes (OS X app), it somehow retrieves the notes I had put long long time ago on a different Mac. So, I am sure those notes are not locally stored. Not only can I see old notes, but I can also add new notes to Google Notes.\nGoogle had Notebook service, but it was discontinued long time ago and existing notes were imported into Google Docs. But I cannot find the notes I see in Notes in Google Docs.\nSo where are the Google Notes stored and Notes is getting the notes from? Is it that Google discontinued the web interface of the Notebook service but somehow still provides an interface to Apple especially? Can I access the notes I saved to Google Notes in Notes outside the Notes application, in a web browser for example?\n\nA: The notes created in OS X can be found in GMail under the label \"Notes\". If you create a folder with [name] in OS X Notes app, the notes will be synced to Google Inbox unbundled label \"Notes/name\".\n\nA: My Macbook SSD broke down so I went to Gmail and entered label:notes on the search field. I found all my notes intact :)\nYou can try the same.\n\nA: In you enable the sync, the notes are saved as \"Sent mails\" in Gmail. Sometimes this can be very annoying, since a new sent email is created every time you just modify a previous note. I had enabled once, but now I get rid of this sync option.\n\nA: You have to create a new folder under Google in the Notes app, otherwise you won't find the bundle or anything in your Google inbox.\n", "Q: Is it possible to add credit to an account from a credit/debit/not a gift card? So I play this game on my iPod, Love Live: School Idol Festival. Within this game you can buy currency called love gems. I want to buy 50 of them, but need to add $10 more credit to my account to do it. I don't want to spend around $30 from the credit/debit/not a gift card. I already have $20 worth of credit on my account. It's just the $10 more I need. Is it possible to put $10 of credit into my account from a credit/debit/not a gift card? I've looked but the cheapest App Store card I can find is $25. I don't need $25. And I don't want to spend $15 unnecessarily. Or if I buy the gems can I charge the remaining to said credit/debit/not a gift card? It's hooked up to a PayPal account, could I add $10 through that? Please help me for I am deep in idol hell and am on a time limit as to when I can figure this out for what I want to spend the gems on if/when I buy them. \n\nA: Here's what you can do: you can have a gift card credit on your account as well as a linked credit card. Here's what you can't do: you can't only add $10 from a credit card to your iTunes account. But if you have a credit on your account now, and you link a credit card to your account, it will use all the remaining credit from the gift card first, then charge the remaining amount to your credit card. \n\nA: I use the Wallet/Passbook to add funds to my account at Apple Retail stores. They take all sorts of payment there, but you'd need to go to the store physically to pay.\nI'm not aware of a way to load the account yourself using the iOS app or online. There also are $15 and $10 cards you can buy online - you need to trust that the vendor will email you a valid code - but I've not had issues when I use a major retailer like Target to make an online purchase.\nYou could also send a friend to the Apple Store to buy a blank card with the custom amount you desire - they have blank cards for that purpose.\nOnline sales from Apple doesn't seem to cary the custom amount cards so you've got lots of options to not over spend if you can take advantage of one of them.\n", "Q: Mad Catz R.A.T. 3 mouse problems on MacBook Pro I am having difficult time to customize the buttons on my RAT 3 mouse. I want my side buttons to go forward and backward. Anyone know how to do that?  \nAlso scrolling wheel is inverted and I don't know how to change that? \nEvery time I reconnect my mouse, it doesn't register mouse settings according to always switching my DPI when I reconnect it. I am running on OSx El Capitan 10.11\n\nA: Download the R.A.T.E software from madcatz (under software), that allows you to wire up keys to forward and back, as well as setting the DPI properly.\nNote, you have to allow the app in Security & Privacy after install completes \nThe inverted scrolling wheel is due to OSX treating all mouse as a Magic mouse. Changing the scroll direction to natural in system setting will affect both the touchpad and mouse, which is annoying because the touchpad direction is right.\nI recommend Scroll Reverser which applies scroll direction separately.\n", "Q: Reveal each bullet by opacity in Keynote 6.6? This question is an exact duplicate of How to partially uncover bullet points in Keynote except that I am asking for the current generation of Keynote (version 6.6.1, rather than Keynote '09). \nI want the slide to initially appear with all bullet groups translucent (dimmed by opacity set to low number). On each click fully reveal each bullet group by becoming opaque (opacity set to 100%). \nAs seen in this animated gif:\n\nI want the same effect as Build In > Appear & Move > Dissolve with Delivery set to By Bullet Group, but I want the initial display of all bullet groups to be translucent rather than hidden.\nMy motivation is so that while giving a presentation I can see all the items immediately to remind me how to properly phrase my speaking, yet keep the audience’s attention on each bullet point.\n\nA: This is what I tried and it worked in Keynote 6.6.1 (2560):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create Bullet points text.\n\n*Select all bullet points and Copy \n\n*Select all\nbut the first bullet point and set color to 10% white (or whatever you like) leaving the first line at 100%.\n\n*Paste the saved bullet points over the existing and align precisely.   \n\n*Apply the following setting to the newly pasted bullet points:\n\n\n\nUsing the Animate tool and the settings in the Build In automator Appear, the first bullet point will present in full 100% luminance with the succeeding points dim. As you click, the bullet points will appear as you have shown in your example.\n", "Q: Set the default order and width of colums in the list view for all the folders in Finder I can set the order and width of columns in the folder that's currently front in the screen as default view of that particular folder, but how can I set it as the default view of all the folders? I'd like the columns to always sit in the Name, Date Added, Date Modified, Size, Kind, Date Last Opened, Date Created order, and the width of column for anything other than names to be narrow which ever the folder I'm looking at.\nOS X Mountain Lion\n\nA: If you don't want to use third-party Finder tweaking applications, the Finder has a display settings panel for windows that you get with Cmd-J. The settings you make in the panel are for the currently active  folder window, but there is a Use as Defaults button which does just that for new folder windows. This includes the column order and column width in the active window. \nHowever, this doesn't override the display settings of folders that have been opened before. So in order to make your new display setting the default for all folders, you need to delete all folder display settings, then relaunch the Finder. Resetting is done by deleting the invisible .DS_Store files within each folder, in which the Finder stores the display settings. To do that, you can copy&paste the following Unix command into the Terminal application. The command execution requires you to put in an admin password and will take two minutes or so: \nsudo find / -name \".DS_Store\"  -exec rm {} \\;\n\nWhen it has finished, relaunch the Finder: Press Cmd-Alt-esc to open the 'Force Quit' window where you select 'Finder' and click 'Relaunch'. You will notice that icons on the Desktop are realigned to a standard grid. Now open a Finder window and create the new default display setting.\n(This has been tested on OS X 10.7.5 Lion)\n\nA: Use as Defaults actually sets a particular configuration as the default configuration for any folder.\nDefaults apply globally, unless folder-specific settings exist. Thus, folders whose view options have been customized are not affected by them.\nNewly created folders will comply with your preferences, but folders which you've previously set special view options for may not (depending on the options). Here's a possible solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, run this command:\nsudo find / -name '.DS_Store' -delete\n\nThis will delete all .DS_Store files in your drive, where some of these folder-specific preferences are stored.\n\n*Secondly, you should reset view-related properties from com.apple.Finder domain. However, since there are lots of such properties, you may just reset all Finder's settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close all Finder windows.\n\n*Execute this in your Terminal:\ndefaults delete com.apple.Finder && killall Finder\n\nFinder will be forcibly relaunched.\nAt this point you can open a new Finder window, set it as you want, and change defaults through Show View Options (cmd-J), as you already did.\n", "Q: Submitting a podcast to Apple results in \"Can't read your feed\" I have a podcast that works in iTunes, but when I submit it to the iTunes store via podcastsconnect.apple.com, I receive \"Validation failed\" together with \"Can't read your feed\". It works when I open it directly in iTunes, and it appears to be a valid feed. Is there anything else I could try?\n\nA: It turns out the iTunes Store doesn't support certificates from Let's Encrypt, after discussion with Apple Support.\n", "Q: Do I need to buy Mac OS X again? I am running 10.6.8 on my Mac Pro 1,1 and I want to reset it. I don't have the install disk anymore, so do I need to buy it again? Or can I copy the files from my system, and put them on a disk and boot from that? (I would prefer not to reinstall the OS, I just want to delete files, as it is getting pretty full, is there a way to only do that without completely reinstalling the OS?)\n\nA: I would say the best option might be to get software like Carbon Copy Cloner or use Disk Utility to clone the existing drive to another drive / external drive.\nThen you could clean off the files on that OS and test that booting to it still works. Once you have something that works - you can re-clone or repeat the deletions on the main drive.\n\nA: You can delete files without having to make a copy of the system.  Are you looking for a way to make a backup that you can boot from if you accidentally delete the wrong files?  If so, there are several ways to do that.  I'd suggest looking into OS X Recovery https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314 which allows you to make clones of your primary drive (and do just about anything else that you want to the disk)\n", "Q: Unable to Adjust Size for pdf in Preview As shown in the screenshot the \"Adjust Size\" is disabled and grayed-out for the given PDF:\n\nSo how do we reduce the size of a pdf in preview (or even skim?)\n\nA: I did not find out how to do this in preview or skim: so a \"real\" answer would still be awarded.\nHowever there is a workaround when printing: the print dialog for my HP laserjet has a \"Scale\" that can be applied. This took care of my immediate need.\n\n\nA: The Adjust Size / Colour feature in Preview doesn't work for PDF files, only for bitmap image files. Usually you don't want to change the format of a PDF document, anyway. \nHowever, if you have a PDF file that contains only embedded bitmap images, and you want a downsized version of that image, it's possible to use the Preview's export feature: File > Export. The export dialog will ask for a pixel density (in ppi) to use for the export, as it is assumed that you are converting vector graphics/text to bitmap graphics…  \nAnother possibility is to use the marquee/selection tool to select an area or the whole page and press Cmd-C, then create a new Preview document from the selected area by pressing Cmd-N, and save the new document in a bitmap format.  \nI can't say what it does to the exported image if you put in a ppi value different from the actual ppi value of the embedded image. There are commercially sold third-party tools that extract bitmap images from PDFs without resampling them, e.g. Acrobat Pro/DC and others. A smaller and free tool is downloadable via SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdf-images/\n\nA: The following approach worked for me in Mac OS X 10.13 (High Sierra):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open PDF to shrink in Preview\n\n*Select File -> Export\n\n*Leave format as \"PDF\". In \"Quartz Filter\" select: \"Reduce File Size\"\n\n*In \"Export as\", I changed the file-name e.g. added \"_small\"; so I don't overwrite the original.\n\n*Press on \"Save\"\n\n\nYou don't have any control on scaling parameters, but results were good enough for what I needed.\n", "Q: Unknown event opening Skype periodically Recently Skype has been opening itself or placing itself into focus, regardless of what app is running or on focus. This happens every half an hour to hourly.\nIt's has gotten really annoying, and I have tried to rename the .app to .txt and move skype from Applications folder, however it won't let me change the extension (adds .app to the end of the name i.e. Skype.txt.app) and dragging skype to another location out of /Applications results in a alias being made.\nI've deleted Skype using AppCleaner, and I get this notification window indicating an error in opening skype, which meant that something is opening Skype, not Skype itself.\nThe error window opens whenever the MBP is awakened from sleep, and during use of the MBP (as mentioned in the beginning of the post).\nBefore I deleted Skype, I made sure that there was no relevant apps in the Open at Login window, and in iCal events.\n\nTwo error windows opened when I went to continue typing this post, after waking up the MBP from sleep.

I was running OmniDiskSweeper today, and I came across something called \"Private\" using 3.9GB.

Nothing downloads, nothing happens.  Any suggestions?\nI've just updated to El Capitan 10.11.3\n\nA: Most likely this is down to the fact that your OS is not updated.  The current version of Keynote requires macOS 10.12.  You can confirm this by deleting Keynote from your applications folder, starting AppStore and installing Keynote.  You will get an error message that a later version of your operating system is required.\n\nA: Search for \"Keynote\" in the Mac App Store, and where it usually says \"Download,\" it should say \"Update.\" See if it will update that way.

If you try to delete Keynote, you get an error message saying other processes are still using it.\nRestarting does the trick.\n\nA: i know this is old, but i had the same problem. the solution (on High Sierra) is to delete the Keynote.app. Then App Store, go to purchased and you should be able to install Keynote. It tells you it will download/install the last version compatible with macOS.\n\nA: Sometimes your Mac may accidentally redownload Keynote without deleting the old one. Check in Applications and make sure you don't have two versions of Keynote hiding.\n", "Q: How can I make Safari or Chrome remember my messages in contact forms? As a customer, I contact businesses through contact forms on their websites, and often I forget the exact wording of the message and when I sent it. \n(Often, I need to re-send messages when I don't receive a reply and an email address isn't listed on the site.)\nHow can I make Safari remember the contents of the <textarea> and <input> fields of the <form> element? Preferably timestamped.\nIs there a Safari (or Chrome) extension that does this?\nThis question applies mostly to Mac OS X, but also relevant for iOS devices.\n\nA: For Chrome, there is Lazarus: Form Recovery\n(haven't tried it)\nFor Firefox (although you didn't mention Firefox, I'll put it in any case), there's the TextArea Cache addon.\nFor Safari, I don't know of anything. \nAt the moment I either copy/paste text areas I want to save, or long-click selected text in the textarea, and drag it to a folder in the Finder to create a text clipping. You could also look for a keystroke recorder/keylogger, which would record every key you type in case you need to get back to it later (but those also record spelling mistakes in some cases).\nAnother option for Safari is to use Jumpcut. Jumpcut can save up to 99 text clipboards in its internal memory. I use it all the time for temporary saving purposes. For example, you are typing text inside a text box, quickly select all (cmd + a) then copy all (cmd + c) and you've just \"saved\" the text inside Jumpcut. If your computer crashes or your app crashes, restart it and within Jumpcut your text is accessible, ready to be pasted again.\nAnd since Jumpcut remembers up to 99 clippings, you can easily copy all the fields in a form to paste them again later in the exact same way.\nCreating a clipping from a text field in Safari:\n\n\nA: Typio claims to implement this for Chrome.\nFrom the site:\n\nTypio Form Recovery automatically saves text as you type and lets you easily recover input data in case of loss. You are in full control of which sites auto-save is enabled on and how long the input is saved. Typio is lightweight and secure, your data never leaves your computer.\nThe software is open source, you can view the source code on Bitbucket:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/nicklassandell/chrome-form-recovery/\n\n\nA: The revamped (as of 2020) Form History Control add-on is available for Chrome and Firefox.

Is there a way to continue the backup of the data so that Time Machine doesn't think it has to start the backup of (B) from scratch? Does TM automatically detect that the data on the new hard drive (B) are the same as the ones previously backed up on the old hard drive (A)? \nGiven how flimsy HDD are, I thought this would be a common problem. But I didn't find anything in the questions.\n\nA: When you plug in the new HDD, do you get a message saying\n\nWould you like this computer to inherit the backup history from xxx on the \"xxx\" backup disk?\" \n\nthen an option to choose \n\nDon't Back Up Now, Create New Backup or Inherit Backup History? \n\nIf so, click Inherit Backup History.

I can use Pages on the iPads, and the documents show on all my devices, but when I write them on my Mac, they don't always show on the iPads.  I have made sure I am signed in to iCloud from each device.  Any thoughts?\n\nA: This sounds like an iCloud sync issue on the Mac end, not the iOS end.

State of the art iMac Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, Late 2015, running El Capitan 10.11.3, dual booting to very recent Windows 10. (Don't want to boot it to determine exact release.) So far no crashes on Apple side. On Windows side, twice now: screen goes black, pause, buzzing sound, then many rounds of Windows saying it will fix itself, then crashes again. In these many times it says it will fix itself there has been no buzzing. Today it ran Windows for 20 minutes or so, and then I again got the buzzing. For now, I'm just going to leave it in Apple and see if that crashes, which would suggest hardware.\n\nA: Late model macs such as yours have good support for EFI boot for windows and OS/X. I assume you have installed both via EFI on a disk partitioned using GPT partition scheme.\nI am very familiar with the windows 8.1/10 cycle of trying to fix itself, it never will fix itself, this is something you need to help it with.\nI spent more than a couple of days last week playing with EFI dual boot for Windows and Mac but my Mac isn't up to it.

Just now downloaded current OS-X El Capitan software, did current updates, plus today's version of Windows 10. Everything ran smoothly until it tried to boot, and then it started repairing itself over and over. At least the last time, yesterday, it had booted a bit before it went black and started making the same noise it made in my first-described experience. My hunch is that it has to do with the video drivers, but rebooting with the \"low resolution option\" didn't work either. \n", "Q: Trouble Installing Pygame on Mac - error code 255 in None I need to install pygame on my MacBook for a class, I was able to get it installed fine on my Windows machine, but the OSX installation process has been much rougher.

Unsurprisingly, the Lightning cable that came with my iPhone 5s ~18 months ago is really worn - to the point where all of the rubber cable has had to come off because it had been left around for a while and had gone all sticky (sooooo gross). The outer metal sheathing is still entirely intact.\nThe resulting cable looks like so.\n\nIt still charges (and syncs) my iPhone perfectly. Is this at all dangerous to use (I'm charging my phone from my MacBook)?\nCheers,\nDan\n\nA: Such Voltage is not 'dangerous' but you should get a new one as soon as possible. Why risk a further damage to your iPhone, your Mac or your charger?\n\nA: Just underneath the plastic exterior of the cable is a conductive layer called shielding.  Shielding is grounded, meaning it is connected to 0 V.  It would only be dangerous if you had a serious electrical problem that caused ground in your outlet to be connected to a higher voltage potential.  The actual power is transmitted on wires in the core of the cable.  While the voltage at the core for iPhone charge cables is not typically dangerous, if the center of your cable becomes exposed, it's time to get a new cable.\n", "Q: Copy specific files and keep the subfolder structure I got a folder with a large amount of files with different suffixes in several sub folders.\nMy automator workflow works as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask for Finder Items\n\n*Get Folder Contents (sub folder option checked)\n\n*Filter Finder Items (for a specific file-suffix)\n\n*Copy Finder Items\n\n\nThis works like a charm.

Hope some dev can see this and help diagnose for a fix...\nUpdate#1, Now I upgraded to the 10.11.4 and also upgraded cable driver... Issue still happens...help!!!\nI have a USB to Serial Adaptor for connecting to CONSOLE port of switch/router and I use \"screen\" inside Terminal to connect. Recently I found the \"screen /dev/cu.usbserial 9600\" works only once for every system reboot. Here are the steps to replicate:\n\n\n*\n\n*The output of \"ls /dev/usb\" shows the correct device.\n\n*Login to console of the device with \"screen /dev/cu.usbserial 9600\"\n\n*Press \"Ctrl+A, Ctrl+K\" to exit screen\n\n*(optional), disconnect/reconnect the usb to serial adaptor from laptop OR disconnect/reconnect the console cable from target device.\n\n*The output of \"ls /dev/usb\" still shows the correct device.\n\n*Try to connect to console again with \"screen /dev/cu.usbserial 9600\", the screen process will hang. Once that is happening, the screen process can not be killed via \"sudo kill -9\" and only be solved by complete power cycle. BTW, the laptop will also hang during reboot/shutdown, until I keep pressing on power button...\n\n*Once screen hang, The output of \"ls /dev/usb\" would show nothing.\n\n\nOnce laptop boots up again, I can connect with the same screen command and same scenario for step 2-3 above...\nI have Mac OS 10.11.3 and adaptor is Micro Innovations branded (Prolific chip). I downloaded and installed/re-installed driver from Prolific site and no difference...\nAny idea?\n\nA: Firstly, does cu -l /dev/cu.usbserial -s 9600 work more than once? If not, how does it fail?\nBecause the second open blocks and does not die even with kill -9 it probably it is a driver issue with the call to open(2) getting the initial device handle blocking. The device open might block if the device is not in local mode and the CD input is low.\nSome versions of those devices have hardware flow control bugs. You could try a hardware fix of looping RTS to CTS and connecting DTR, DSR and CD on the connector and just let the RX, TX and ground pins connect to the console port.\nAnother possibility is running stty clocal < /dev/cu.usbserial. This should make the device ignore control signals. This is worth trying from a different terminal while the second open is blocking.\nUpdate:\nYou need to run cu with sudo so that it can write a lock file to /var/spool/uucp. If you have no contention for ports (unlikely on a single user Mac), you can change the lock directory path using a config file. Create an empty directory, then create a config file setting lockdir to that directory path. Something like:\nlockdir /User/yourname/lockdir\n\nThen run using a command line like this:\ncu -I /path/to/conf/file -l /dev/cu.usbserial -s 9600\n\n\nA: I also had this issue, exactly as described with a PL2303 USB/serial device.\nThe solution I went with was to use the driver from https://www.mac-usb-serial.com/\nScreen worked fine after this for multiple connections.\n\nA: I would like to mention, not being mentioned anywhere else, that I have the exact same problem on a Raspberry Pi with the same USB to serial connector.\nOne question that remains unanswered is how to disconnect: I found that out in the cu man page: ~.\nAlso I found out that sudo cu -l /dev/cu.usbserial -s 9600 works on reconnection to the RPi (RPi 1, Model B); but sudo cu -l /dev/cu.usbserial -s 115200 doesn't; which is at odds with Adafruit's instructions, which say screen /dev/cu.usbserial 115200.\nI am happy now to be able to connect and disconnect to the RPi at will. I am also able to cu without sudo.

Then select the .cdr file in the file selection dialog … That's the easiest way. \nBut if you have no Mac with DVD burner at hand, you will need to create a bootable USB flash drive (at least 8 GB capacity). You will have to use Disk Utility to first re-partition and format the flash drive with the 'GUID partition scheme' and the 'Mac OS X Extended (journaled)' format (HFS+, journaled). This makes the flash drive a bootable medium.

I'm looking into buying a new MacBook Pro. The Mid 2012 model I have from work has a CPU with a clock speed of 2.9GHz:\n\nCompared to the models available in Apple's site, which have slower or equal clock speed:\n\nHave I time travelled?\n\nA: You can upgrade the processors to be higher than 2.7GHz. At the customization page, you can also select options with blazing fast Turbo Boost speeds. 15-inch offers quad-core configurations as well.\n\nA: Over the last years the speed, in terms of work frequency, has a relatively modest increase.\n\nSo I guess Apple prefer provide better performance in other field (e.g., display, RAM, SSD, etc) instead of processor only.\n\nAnyway, you can also ask for higher performance. For a good comparison, it would be nice to know the price your company paid in the 2012 for that machine.\n\nA: What you are seeing in Apple website are the newer models with newer Intel processors. Your 2012 MBP model have a 22nm Core i7 \"Ivy Bridge\" Processor. The newer 2015 MBPs have 14nm \"Broadwell\" processor.

The problem is that it works only 30% of the time , and is other wise very laggy. In addition to this I have tried Share IT, Pushbullet , Instashare. \nUSB is an option, but my requirement is to use my Mac as a repository for the files, and access as I need. Is there a way I could set up a network between my three devices (by say smb or ftp) and then access files (like the BitTorrent way) ? I did try the share folders option, but I didn't quite understand it correctly.\n\nA: If you share files from your Mac by checking the box next to 'File Sharing' in the 'Sharing' pane of 'System Preferences' then you need to connect to that share using a client app on your device (like the 'File Connect' app for iOS.) Apple File Protocol (AFP) and Microsoft compatible SMB are the two choices for sharing.\nBittorent is a peer-to-peer method of sharing files. AFP, SMB, and FTP are client/server methods of sharing files and work completely different from peer-to-peer. With a client/server method, you would access your files directly from your Mac.\nFor what it’s worth, if DropBox is not working out for you, the problem is likely on your end.\n\nA: Try Instashare\nhttp://instashareapp.com\nI've never used this nor am I affiliated with this product.

Resize and position as desired.\n\n*Select \"Float on Top\" from the View menu.\n\n*Now start your screen recording.\n\n\nA: I do not think this is possible with Quicktime but there is free app which allow you to add webcam in desktop recordings - https://www.monosnap.com/\n", "Q: How do I run a terminal command for different values How do I have to label i such that the do command is repeated for all values of i.\nE.g. \nif i =2:\ncd /Users/xxx/zTree; wine explorer /desktop=1,640x480 zleaf.exe /language english /name lab1\ncd /Users/xxx/zTree; wine explorer /desktop=2,640x480 zleaf.exe /language english /name lab2\n\nBut somehow this does not work, where is my mistake?\ndisplay dialog \"how many leafs?\" default answer \"\"\n\nset i to the text returned of result as integer\nrepeat while i > 0\n  tell application \"Terminal\"\n    do script \"cd /Users/xxx/zTree; wine explorer /desktop=$i,640x480 zleaf.exe /language english /name lab$i\"\n    set i to i - 1\n    activate\n  end tell\nend repeat\n\n\nA: medbot is right that you should really do this as a shell script but since it's hard to do dialog boxes like in Applescript here's the answer:\ndisplay dialog \"how many leafs?\" default answer \"\"\n\nset i to the text returned of result as integer\nrepeat while i > 0\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        do script \"cd /Users/xxx/zTree; wine explorer /desktop=\" & i & \",640x480 zleaf.exe /language english /name lab\" & i\n    end tell\nset i to i - 1\nend repeat\n\n\nA: If you intend to automate Terminal commands, you would achieve this by writing a plain text file called a shell script. The shell script file would contain the commands you wish to execute, each separated by a line. The shell script file can also contain programmatic statements with variables and operators. When you wish to execute the shell script, you would simply issue the filename of the shell script at a command prompt as you would for a built in command.\nWhat is not exactly clear in your question is, where do you intend the variable 'i' to get its starting value, and what should be done differently each time 'i' is incremented and evaluated?\nAlso, 'cd' is not a script, it is a command.\n", "Q: How to I bulk remove pages using a wildcard search from Safari History on OS X?

Such as when trying to write to /usr/share ...\n\nOperation not permitted\n\n\nA: System Integrity Protection doesn't prevent you creating sym links in / because the root of the file system is not protected!\nBut the root of the OS X file system already contains an invisible volume/mount point home created by /etc/auto_master (and /etc/auto_home). Your intension to create an equally named sym link there conflicts with this and is therefore forbidden.\nNetwork users who login to the local machine will have their home directories mounted in /home according to the details in /etc/auto_home.\n\nA: Create an alias instead of using ln. To do it, right click the required folder and click create alias, then drag this shortcut folder to your desktop or home folder as you want.\n\nA: Likely System Integrity Protection?\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899\nYou can disable it and verify this I suppose.\n", "Q: count of desktops only returns 1 Any idea why the following script would only return 1, when I clearly have more than one Desktop open?\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set n to count of desktops\n    display alert n\nend tell\n\nI have even tried it with JAX JavaScript and also get 1. \nNote: For reference I am using El Capitan (MBP Mid 2012)\n\n\nA: 'desktops' are 'monitors' not Spaces.\nThere's no programmatic way to count Spaces, short of using the GUI, which is very hit & miss.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro not booting beyond mounting Recovery HD For some reason El Capitan doesn't boot.

I then get a prompt saying they will be deleted from all my devices and confirmed. They are deleted from my Mac but they come back every time I attach my iPhone again i.e. they are not deleted from the device even though OS X says they should be. \n\nA: Relevant section from the manual: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21294?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nSummary: you can delete photos/videos through Photos/iCloud (https://icloud.com), but they are not removed immediately. They are moved into a Recently Deleted album (like the Trash on your Mac) and deleted automatically later. (They are kept for 40 days so it tales a long time for them to disappear)\nNote in Photos.app this is not a normal album but accessible by File->Show Recently Deleted.\nYou can open the Recently Deleted album and delete the videos/photos from there to remove them from the device permanently.

Tim Cook's open letter about the FBI's attempts to access a locked iPhone 5c have me wondering a fairly simple question that I haven't found an answer for:\nAssumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have an encrypted iPhone\n\n*It is set to wipe after 10 failed passcode attempts\n\n*It is currently locked\n\n*I only use Apple-approved methods\n\n\nQuestion:\nCan I update iOS on the device without unlocking it and without losing/wiping  the data?\nUpdate:\nAs an aside to the actual question, I see that the FBI is not trying to do what I'm asking. They are asking for a version of iOS that they would load directly into RAM and run from RAM without making any modifications to either the OS partition or the user partition.\n\nA: You cannot update iOS on a locked device. When you try to update via iTunes(which is the only possible in this situation), it will ask you to unlock the iPhone. It is simply not possible to update or restore a locked iPhone or any iOS device.\n\nA: Update: I have discussed this with someone who has specifically tried this. I now understand what happens here.\nThe answer is no, with one notable exception.\nHaving looked through Apple's documentation, I have found conflicting information.\nFirst, the iOS Security Guide describes going into Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) mode and Recovery mode. It states that from either mode, the device must be restored to factory default settings. However, that is in direct conflict with the link it provides to recovery mode.\nThe Link from the iOS security guide puts you on this Apple support page. On this page it states that if you choose the Update option,\n\niTunes will try to reinstall iOS without erasing your data.\n\nI now know this line to be a simplification. In this scenario, when iTunes reinstalls iOS, it's only option is to restore the iPhone to factory default settings.\nIf you have logged into your phone but haven't rebooted it, and you have previously synced it via iTunes, you can backup the contents using the same computer. So in this case iTunes will backup the contents, reinstall iOS with a restore to factory default settings, then restore the contents from the backup.\nOnce the iPhone is rebooted, you can only restore to factory default settings. You can restore the contents of a previously made backup, but you cannot backup the data from the phone.\n\nA: Yes you can.\nPlace iPhone in DFU mode while connected to a Mac.\nfind it in finder. And there press Restore iPhone. You can then upgrade the iOS while restoring.\n\nA: No, you can not update iOS on a locked phone. Because it's a protection mechanisms from Apple. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Make mac become more server Take another system I use (for example CentOS).\nI use the following code to make it become server.\n# No GUI\nsystemctl set-default multi-user.target\n\n# Enable SSH\nsudo systemctl start sshd\n\nIt has two big advantages.\n\n\n*\n\n*doesn't sleep\n\n*saves power\n\n\nCan I do something similar in OS X? \nP.S.

Now all of the text messages come over with my name instead of her name.  Can I change this on the iphone without setting up an apple id for her?\n\nA: No. You have to set up an AppleID for her. If you want to share apps and music purchases, then you can use Family Sharing, and you can even specify if your child is able to purchase music/apps, or require you to approve the purchase first. This way, she is not able to rack up a huge bill, and you can both have separate messaging accounts.\n", "Q: Missing app icons on Apple Watch I've got a problem in that some app icons on my Apple Watch seem to be missing their artwork. This only happens to a few apps at a time, seemingly randomly and I haven't noticed a specific trigger. The apps otherwise work normally and the icons are present if I look at the list of apple watch apps on my iPhone. \nIf I uninstall and reinstall the app, that usually fixes it temporarily at least but I was wondering if there was a quicker/easier way to fix it or prevent it from happening in the first place.\n\n\nA: https://www.google.com/amp/s/9to5mac.com/2017/06/07/how-to-switch-between-list-view-and-honeycomb-app-grid-on-apple-watch-with-watchos-4/amp/\nI hope this help!................................\n\nA: The only way I found to fix, is to use the Apple Watch Application on your iPhone.  Remove the application (slider off \"Show App on Apple Watch\"), once it's uninstalled, reinstall it (slider a=back on \"Show App on Apple Watch\").   Not a great solution, especially when you have 8 or more apps missing their artwork, like I did; However it works.\n\nA: I would unpair the Apple Watch, reset the watch and then then pair it again and make sure that you are on the latest update for your watch.\n\nA: I figured out that I had not set the target of the corresponding folder to the correct one. I for example have three separate folders, Main, Watch and Watch Extension. I had not set the target for the Watch folder and the app icon therefore did not load, now it works. \n", "Q: What is the crlcache keychain and why do I have so many of them?

system that might need Apple engineering assistance to remedy. The reason I say that is your listings all look appropriate and you don't have an explicit keychain for each entry in the UI.\nWithout analyzing your usage of the script, the logical conclusion I would make is that these are artifacts or direct results of your scripting.\nOne thing you could try is disabling both OCSP and CRL temporarily and see if the count of rogue keychains remains stable. In theory - it's always best to check for revoked certificates, but in practice, you might not be at much risk if you do so for a short period of time or even in general.\nAnother thing would be to look at the open files for the process to see if you can locate keychain files outside the normal ~/Library/Keychains and /Library/Keychains locations on the filesystem. If they are hidden in /private or worse - kept in RAM and exposed like a file, you might have a hard time tracking them down without placing that program in a debugger like Instruments.\n", "Q: How do I display unsupported emoji on OS X Yosemite OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 by default can't display some emoji, for example the \"Cloud with rain\" emoji: .\nHow can I view such problematic emoji?

I'm trying to read this PDF(The link is at the bottom of the page) and be able to add notes on my iPad say, but then be able to read it on my iPhone and see the notes/add more notes to it. Problems I often have are having to make a copy of it on each device as it can't be saved or it's in my iBooks on one device but not another (eg - I have a Pro Git book in my phone, but it's never made it to my iPad). I've tried a coupe of different apps and read links also, so I must be missing something fundamental.\n\nA: As suggested by the OP, from the comments:\nDepending on the PDF viewer, the PDFs could be stored in the cloud, using something like Dropbox.

If you select multiple emails and drag and drop, only one email is transferred.\nHow can I do this drag and drop method for all the folders and all emails within those folders, to save them on an external hard drive.\nI don't want to export all the emails from my current Mac, then reimport them to my new Mac Mail. I want to be able to access all the emails in their structure, but through my hard drive instead of having them show in Mac Mail.\nGuidance appreciated\n\nA: Email archiving is hard. I've used all of the solutions above and many more (see below).\nIn the end, I partially gave up after making several archives and decided to keep a structured master archive on my main work computer (we're talking about 20 GB of email) just to be sure that I have a single copy in a  very standard format Apple Mail 4.6 (Snow Leopard edition) with more or less attachments still attached for the last seven years (most Eudora attachments are listed and are findable but are not directly attached to the email). The other advantage of keeping all your mail in Apple Mail is that it's a single archive to search. Surprisingly often I do find that I want to find and review a conversation from 2003 or 2006.\nEmailchemy does work although I used Eudora Mailbox Cleaner for my own migration from Eudora (read the notes there and at Tidbits to fully understand just how hard email migration/archiving is). The Weird Kid licenses are so expensive (imagine that if you are using at work, you should be paying about $300 for the privilege, even if you only have a few computers/accounts to migrate).\nThe simplest solution would be to migrate your Apple Mail account to Thunderbird and the use Thunderbird's built-in archiving tool which does offer unencrypted structured archiving:\n\nBeginning with version 3.x, Thunderbird has built-in support for archiving e-mail. The \"archived\" messages are moved to a dedicated folder (or hierarchy of folders) within the Thunderbird profile. These are ordinary mail folders (using either mbox or maildir files, depending upon how the account is configured), not compressed files.\n\nPaid alternative options\n\n\n*\n\n*EagleFiler with its fair $40 license let you do pretty much whatever you like. Great documentation and support available from Michael Tsai is personal and of high quality (I've had good answers myself as well as seeing much public praise for the support). There is an option for storing messages in mbox or eml files: \n\nEagleFiler can also store messages as individual .eml message files, one per message. This is less efficient (for EagleFiler, Spotlight, Time Machine, etc.) but is more flexible because you can drag and drop the messages to different folders to rearrange them. Message files can also be mixed in the same folder with other files of different types, e.g. PDF or Word documents that are related to those messages. You can double-click a message file to open it in Apple Mail.\n\n\n*Mailsteward Pro uses full MySQL (i.e. open source but a bit tricky to install) and costs $100. You can export and merge databases and automate archiving. John Seward's application is pretty geeky. While support is gruff, it is available and personal. As it's MySQL, you'll always be able to get your data out in the format you want.\n\n*MailSteward normal is $50 but uses MySQL Lite so is not suited for large archives.\n\n*Devonthink Professional is $150 and does a good job of providing an archive but foregoes opens source standard mail message or mailbox structure and loses attachments. That said, search is fast, fine grained. Devonthink looks great for a text application. I've owned Devonthink and have the opportunity to use the pro mail import but have chosen not to. With my large archive, I've not been happy with it and have never liked that Devonthink import is truly a one way street.\n\n\nConclusion\nFirst I'd try Thunderbird and see if I like its archive format. Then I'd go to EagleFiler. If I was more persnickety and there were still issues bothering me about EagleFiler, I'd then consider full Mailsteward.\nI would not fiddle with fragile Apple scripts or \nAutomator which would need regular renewal and maintenance and are subject to immediate Apple style deprecation.\nI'm going to follow my own advice take another go myself with EagleFiler and consider removing any mail older than 5 years from Apple Mail.\n\nA: To save all mails individually in the Finder, use a little trickery:\nIn Mail, select all messages you want and right-click + choose Forward as Attachment. This creates a new e-mail which you then send to yourself. \nWhen the e-mail has arrived, bring it to the front and press Cmd-A to select all attachments in the e-mail. Click the Save button and choose Save All… from the drop-down menu, then select or create a folder in the file dialog.\nThe e-mails will be saved as individual .eml files, which you can quickview in the Finder or open in Mail or Thunderbird. \nThe downside is that the files are saved with the subject line as file name. So there is no date or sender to organize the files in the Finder. You'd have to pre-organize in Mail.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is to use Emailchemy:\nhttp://www.weirdkid.com/products/emailchemy/index.html\nThe workflow is pretty self-explanatory. The one thing worth mentioning is that the format that will work best for export is EML Files (RFC-2822 format). You can open them with Mail (without importing them) and you can preview them with Quicklook.\nYou could also accomplish this using an Applescript or Javascript script, but that would require a little more work.\n\nA: \"If you select multiple emails and drag and drop, only one email is transferred.\"\nThis used to be the behavior on my machine for a long long time and when I asked about it I'd hear from others that they could drag and drop many emails at once and have all of them transfer as individual emails. Well, unfortunately, I don't what changed but suddenly (it might have be an OS upgrade over the last year) I was also able to drag multiple emails out from mail to the desktop or any folder and get an individual email for each email dragged.\nOnce this multiple item drag and drop was available, I was able to use a Keyboard Maestro macro to do the drag and drop to the desktop part and Hazel to move the emails to their respective Finder folders leaving just the odd email without a Hazel rule to handle moving manually or create a new Hazel rule for.\n", "Q: Cannot pair Playstation 3 controller to iMac firstly, apologies if this has been asked before, however I have read tons of online guides and had no luck solving this issue.\nI bought a Playstation 3 controller with the intention of using it to play games on my Mac and my bootcamped Windows machines (I do not own a Playstation 3 console). Eager to start playing my games from a whole new perspective, I searched the web for instructions on how to connect the gamepad to the Mac computer via USB and Bluetooth.\nAs I said, I've read a dozen different guides and watched a few videos explaining how this could be achieved. They always list the same set of instructions:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in via USB, controller should show up on list of Bluetooth\ndevices.  \n\n*Press PS button and remove the USB cable; lights on    controller\nshould blink faster and Mac should ask for a passcode.\n\n*Enter passcode, add device to favourites, done.\n\n\nHowever, I can't seem to get past that second step, where I am supposed to press the button and remove the USB cable. First of all, the lights blink slowly as the computer is charging the controller. Pressing the PS button doesn't make them blink faster, as when the device is looking to pair via Bluetooth. Also, when I remove the USB cable, the lights stop blinking altogether.\nTo expand on what happens step by step, the controller first shows up as 'Not connected', as expected. When I press the PS button, it switches to 'Connected' and the lights blink faster. After a few seconds, the lights stop blinking and eventually the controller switches back to 'Not connected'.\nIf I click on 'Pair' while the controller is 'Connected', it will either say 'Pairing failed' or 'Couldn't connect to this device' (I'm not really sure when each of these appear, but either way it just means I've been unsuccessful in trying to connect the device). I've never got a pop-up asking for a passcode.\nMy computer is a mid-2011 iMac 21.5\" running OSX El Capitan 10.11.3 Beta. I've had some luck connecting my controller to my Windows 10 machine, however only through USB (I don't think I tried Bluetooth) and of course with the aid of Motioninjoy.\nI'm thinking if I can't get this gamepad to work then I might replace it with either an Xbox 360 one (which seems to be the most compatible with PC/Mac games) or a Playstation 4 one (which I'd assume is more compatible with the newest OSX).\nI would very much appreciate any help. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Are you're suggesting that you bought the controller used? If that is the case, are you sure that the battery isn't shot? Try leaving the USB cable plugged in and let the controller charge for a while. From my experience, if the battery is charged then pressing the PS button should at least blink something.\nI have owned a PS3 only for the last year and rarely use it, but I have noticed that it only seems to charge when plugged into a PS3 as it doesn't seem to do much when plugged into an outlet that has USB charging ports on it (never tried an independent USB charging adapter).\nIf your battery is toast, I think you can find replacements on Amazon for several dollars. Documentation on the internet seems to indicate that replacing the PS3 controller battery is trivial for someone with basic electronics repair skills.\n\nA: Plug in via USB, controller should show up on list of Bluetooth devices.\nPress PS button and remove the USB cable; lights on controller should blink faster then stop blinking so it's already connected but in list it shows not connected or failed.\nJust open your app for example retroarch or kodi then press PS button to start using the controller \n", "Q: Issue with Homebrew when trying to parallelly install Python 3.x I am trying to install Python v.3.x in parallel with the already installed Python v.2.7.10.

Their installation has been made through two ordinary .pkg downloaded files.\nSo, in order to avoid possible future incompatibilities, how could I solve the warnings above reported? Are there alternative solutions to a brief uninstalling and reinstalling procedure?\nIf it could be useful, I am using all these applications on OS X 10.9 Mavericks.\n\nA: brew doctor spits out possible sources of error in your setup (see a description of some errors and reasons for which they are triggered on the Homebrew Github page, like this). If you aren't running into issues with your setup, you can usually ignore the messages (they're there to help Homebrew maintainers to solve issues, should you have them). \nWith this in mind, I think you can ignore the messages related to header files and .pc files from Jack. If you want to clear these ones, you can remove your current installation and brew install jack, which will house all of those files in \"Homebrew-approved\" locations. \nAs far as the Python issues, it looks like you installed Python from a package downloaded from python.org. This resulted in your PATH being modified (either by you via their instruction, or as part of the install script) with a line in your .bash_profile. When you type python at the command line, the system will execute whatever version of Python it finds first in the PATH. In your case, it's the 2.7 version in /Library/Frameworks/. You can uninstall that version using the instructions here, replacing instances of 3.x with 2.7. Regardless of whether or not you keep that installation, you can ensure that python directs to the \"Homebrew-ed\" version by making sure that /usr/local/bin occurs before /Library/Frameworks/... in your PATH. \nIn other words, remove the statement:\nPATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}\" \nexport PATH\n\nfrom your .bash_profile, or change the first line to:\nPATH=\"${PATH}:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin\" export PATH\n\nThis second version is somewhat useless, as there are two versions of Python that will be encountered before the Frameworks version (the Homebrew one in /usr/local/bin and the system version in /usr/bin). If you're curious where all of your Python versions live, you can check with which -a python, which lists all binaries named python in your PATH. \n", "Q: Creating partition on USB drive I have been following directions to create a bootable USB drive from here:\nhttp://borgstrom.ca/2010/10/14/os-x-bootable-usb.html\nHere is the relevant screenshot:\n\nHowever for my case on the USB Drive (a new 32GB Sandisk): the Disk Utility shows the Partition tab is disabled:\n\nHints on whether the procedure being followed were incorrect appreciated.\n\nA: Apple declines to partition many more drives on 10.11 than it did in the past.

Nothing works, but I don't know if you can reset the PRAM or SMC when there is no power.

It was a dead SMC.\n", "Q: Disable \"show password\" in Keychain Access Is this possible?\nI know some users use this function to recover forgotten passwords, however revealing a password in plaintext feels like extremely bad practice.\nIn my case, multiple users share a workstation, and all have the admin password. Keychain stores passwords to my personal accounts that we do not share. My password is sitting there waiting to be ripped off.\n\nA: The keychain is an encrypted container and only the user who has the password can unlock it.  Being an admin on a computer does not allow you to unlock the keychain.  Not even root can do it.  \nOf course, as an admin, there are ways to install software and get the data but it isn't as simple as opening the keychain and looking.  \n\nA: I suggest you set up multiple accounts. You could set up one admin account (that you can all access for adding applications etc. across users) and then individual user accounts. You'll be able to share data etc. Apple Sharing Data Among Users Article (El Capitan).\nAccounts exist for this purpose so I'm optimistic you can set them up to fulfill your team's specific needs.\nOtherwise I would treat it as a public computer (don't save passwords/use incognito/delete all data from browser after using).\n", "Q: Is any user data stored on Apple AirPort Express I want to sell an AirPort express that I no longer use. Is any user data stored on the unit and if so how do I remove it?\n\nA: Your AirPort Express does store some unique data including your wireless passphrase, routing table, ARP table, etc.\nBeyond that, there should not be any personal data on the device. It does not cache files.\nNonetheless, you should open AirPort Utility on your Mac, select the symbol of the device, and select Base Station -> Restore Default Settings… from the menu bar. That way, the next user will start with a fresh configuration.\n", "Q: Finder keeps freezing I have a late 2013 Mac Pro (running Yosemite) and have had some problems with a frozen finder recently. When I select a tif/pdf/jpg file it freezes up on me and I have to force quit it. It freezes before it is able to splay the thumbnail of the file I have selected. It sometimes also freezes safari when I click on links or download something, although its a much more frequent problem for my finder.\nAny help to get around this is appreciated, its a really annoying problem!! \nEdit: spotlight also now freezes but my activity monitor is suggesting all is well\n\nA: Check the Task Manager to see if anything (like Finder) is hogging Memory or CPU cycles, and check the disk activity as well.\n", "Q: Sharing internet connection from WiFi to Thunderbolt Ethernet doesn't work - no DHCP addresses are given out I can't seem to get my MacBook Pro to share the WiFi connection over Ethernet.

I know this may stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the way disk images are intended to work, but even when full permissions are granted on a .dmg file, I am unable to add or remove files on the mounted disk image. Is there any way (natively or via a 3rd-party tool) to do this?\nI know that when a disk image is mounted, a checksum verification is done, so I'm guessing that because modifying the image at all would destroy the checksum, this is inherently not allowed, but I'm wondering if there's a utility that could re-image the disk with a subset of its contents, perhaps recalculating the checksum in the process.\nNOTE: Copying all the contents over, deleting, and then re-imaging is not a plausible option, due to the size of the image and the fact that it already fills most of the available space of the external drive on which it resides.\n\nA: You can edit, add, and remove files on a Disk Image if it is formatted to be readable and writable, which is set at the creation of the Disk Image.\nThis is a different concept than file permissions: File permissions allow you to read, i.e. mount, an entire Disk Image, or delete it in entirety (as a Disk Image itself is a single large file). How the Disk Image was formatted sets the rules for if you can only read (or both read and write) files within the Disk Image.\nTo natively create a readable and writable copy of a Disk Image, you can use the hdiutil of macOS via Terminal.app like this:\nhdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ReadableAndWritableCopy.dmg ReadOnlyOriginal.dmg\nYou can then edit what is in the ReadableAndWriteableCopy.dmg Disk Image and create another copy with your edits that is read-only (like the original was) like this:\nhdiutil convert -format UDRO -o ReadOnlyCopy.dmg ReadableAndWriteableCopy.dmg\n\nA: A disk image is designated as read-only or read-write when it is created. Simply changing the permissions on the DMG file will have no effect.\nHere is one purported solution that I have not tried myself, that uses the hdiutil convert command to make a disk image writable, and hdiutil resize to add extra space if required for any additional content.\n", "Q: How to disable screensaver for newly created user? I am fairly new to OS X, I am trying to disable the screensaver of a user that I recently created with the following commands on the terminal of an account that I'm currently logged in as:\n    sudo dscl . create /Users/NewUser\n\n    # More commands are run after this one, but skipping to the important part...\n\n    sudo defaults write /Users/NewUser/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.MAC_UUID.plist idleTime 0\n\nHowever this doesn't seem to be working. I've noticed that when you create a new user, there is no screensaver plist that exists until the user actually logins.\nI am not too familiar with plists and Apple in general, any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Have you tried running it as the other user using:\nsudo -u NewUser defaults write /Users/NewUser/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.MAC_UUID.plist idleTime 0\n\nThe command I found for setting the screensaver to never start was:\nsudo -u NewUser defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime 0\n\n", "Q: Use a Mac App Store free app without having to associate/login to Apple ID? The scenario:\nI'm working on a friend's Mac. To proceed with the task at hand, I need a specific tool. This tool is available for free (and does not use in app purchases) from the Mac App Store, but isn't available as a direct download from the developer.\nI do not wish to log into my own Apple ID on my friend's Mac, for a number of reasons: having to deal with de-associating and re-associating my friend's ID with his machine, the fact that there is an apparent limit as to how many Macs can be logged into the App Store under a single account, etc.\nMy friend is not present and thus I do not have his Apple ID password to download it under his account. It wouldn't be a reasonable request to me to ask my friend to provide his Apple ID password to me. (Assume that before giving me his machine, my friend set his local system password to something generic so I would be able to know it, but has obvious good reasons to not do this with his Apple ID password.)\nAnother scenario:\nI am at work and just received a Mac. The IT management says that employees are permitted to install any apps onto the machine as long as they are free. (So, for example, I'd be allowed to install Homebrew, or stuff from SourceForge, etc.) However, the machine is logged into a \"corporate\" Apple ID, and thus I cannot re-associate it to my ID even temporarily. Also, I would not be able to \"purchase\" the free app under the corporate ID as I would not know its password.\nIn both scenarios, I do have local administrator rights to the machine. \nIn these scenarios, is there a way to use the free app from the Mac App Store on the machine in question, without having to associate that machine with my own Apple ID, or purchase the app under someone else's account?\n\nA: An Apple ID in OS X is attached to the account, not to the machine so you can create a new account, use your Apple ID, use the app, then delete the account when finished.\nAnother alternative is to use another Apple ID.  There is nothing stating that you can't have more than one Apple ID.  Just create one for when you are doing tech work like what you are doing now and use that one.\nFinally, you can ask your friend to sign in and use his account so you can download the app under his profile.\n\nA: Since the application is free and doesn't contain any in-app purchases I would suggest you to email the developer that you would like to have a directly link to download the application. In most cases those people are generous and don't hesitate to provide you with an alternative. I am able to tell this because once I had some kind of problem with my AppStore and at the same I had to download Memory Clean. So I mailed the developers for a link and got an answer within 24 hours. Let me know if this worked :)\n", "Q: Found a strange group on my Mac When I get information on various items such as System Preferences or a specific utility such as Script Editor, I can see that there is a group user called \"wheel\" that I can not eliminate.

I've already unchecked \"show in lock screen\" w/in notification settings but they still show up when screen is locked.\n\nA: It sounds like you may have disabled notifications from displaying on the lock screen for some Calendar notifications, but not all. Go to Settings->Notifications->Calendar. From here, you can choose which calendar notifications are displayed on the Lock Screen (upcoming events, invitations, invitee responses, shared calendar changes, events found in Mail). If you don't want any Calendar notifications on the lock screen, then you should turn the setting off in each of these submenus. \n", "Q: Macbook Air recognizes battery while starting, but later says \"no battery available\" (battery icon X) I spilled a full glass of water on the keyboard of my Macbook Air 11\" mid-2011 (running OS X Mavericks).\nAfter drying everything out, etc., here's what happens when I start the laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*It has to be plugged in to start.

If I plug the magsafe back in, nothing changes. \n\n*If I don't pull out the magsafe plug in (2.), then the laptop reaches the login screen just fine, and after I log in, there's an X on the battery icon with the message \"no battery found\".\nI've tried SMC, PRAM resets.\nIt's clear that the battery is being recognized for a while, so it's not some mechanical connection issue.\nIf this might be some firmware issue, is there some way to update the Macbook's firmware?\n\nA: Unfortunately, intermittent battery connection failures can also be a result of spilling water on the computer.  It's not just a case of either it works or not.\nYou'll need to take the computer in to a service center. The technician will likely try swapping out the battery first to see if that does the trick. Otherwise, you might be looking at a full logic board replacement.\n", "Q: some apps are not in settings app on iOS I noticed that the apps I developed and tested on my device, doesn't appear in the Settings.

Is there any way to prevent Mail from checking for mail if the VPN is down?\n\nA: Have your employer block access to the IMAP server from non VPN connections. That way Mail can check all it likes but it won't get anywhere. As long as Mail is using a secure connection for the IMAP server it will reject most any nefarious attempt to hijack the attempted connection.\n\nA: I'm not sure if you can do it for a single application, but what you're looking for a is a killswitch.

As I understand it, FileVault makes you login before you computer boots to the OS in order to unlock the drive. This means someone getting ahold of your laptop when it is off cannot get at the data.\nWhat are the implications of using FileVault with sleep? I assume the drive is still considered unlocked during sleep. Anyone that opens the sleeping laptop would have to know your login to do anything with the computer, but is the data insecure to someone very determined at that point (assuming they can't guess your password)?\nI was considering turning on FileVault but since I never power down, the answer to this will help me decide what value there is in doing so.\n\nA: If you don't require the password when you wake from sleep, then you are leaving yourself open to someone taking control of your data. That is regardless of FileVault.\nIf you have password set, then the data is still protected from being viewed in a similar method to it being on a locked file vault volume. You can also set a MDM profile to have the FileVault keys destroyed in RAM when the machine enters sleep, so that's pretty much as good as powering off in my book:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.apple.com/deployment/osx/#/iore5b074158\nFor anything but a highly motivated and skilled adversary (think NSA or FBI) - the extra security you get by powering down the Mac is hard to estimate or differentiate from a locked screen.\n\nThat being said, you should turn on FileVault if you have an SSD since there is no other way to ensure destruction of sensitive data other than destroying the key that decrypts data on the drive. You can then decide to sleep or to power off based on how secure you judge your physical environment and the data you have on your Mac from moment to moment.\n", "Q: More than two windows split view Is there some sort of clever hack of achieving that, because I did not find anything. I have a 27\" Mac and everything is still kind of huge.\n\nA: I can recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Spectacle which is free, you can move and expand windows to\nsides and corners with keyboard shortcuts\n\n*BetterTouchTool which is paid-for, and includes drag-to-edge to size windows to sides or corners, among many other features\n\n\nA: Hopefully something like this becomes a standard Mac feature.  I like the split screen feature, but sometimes I want/need more than two screens.  I found a pretty good solution on the Apps store that will let you have split screen, one window half/two in quarters, or 4 windows is quarters.   It is called Magnet.  Works great on OSx Sierra, and is much cheaper than Divvy.  Here's the link!\n\nA: yabai\nIf you want a more powerful alternative to Rectangle, you could use the free and open-soure Yabai, which you can configure however you like.\n\nyabai is a window management utility that is designed to work as an extension to the built-in window manager of macOS. yabai allows you to control your windows, spaces and displays freely using an intuitive command line interface and optionally set user-defined keyboard shortcuts using skhd and other third-party software.\n\n\nA: The app I am now using is Magnet. It is available on the Mac AppStore and performs beautifully. It has shortcuts, graphical buttons and you can drag the windows to the sides of the screen to snap them to halves or to corners to snap them to quarters.\n\n\nA: BetterSnapTool\nAn app you might want to check is BetterSnapTool. It does what you want and is available from the Mac App Store. It sells for $2.99. I know you wanted a free app but I couldn't find one for the Mac.\n\nBetterSnapTool allows you to easily manage your window positions and sizes by either dragging them to one of your screens corners or to the top, left or right side of your screen. This lets you easily maximize your windows or position them side by side. In addition, you can set keyboard shortcuts in order to move and resize your windows the way you want.\n\n\nA: @Harry is actually providing a very good recommendation without being very specific about it.\nSpectacle does (almost) exactly what you're looking for. It's not strictly speaking split view, but it allows you to split windows between the three third of the screen via simple shortcuts:\n\nIn addition, it's free and open-source.\n\nA: Me from the future here; I ended up settling for Magnet\nIt has nice logical shortcuts to snap windows to quarters, halves and thirds of the screen and supports dragging to the edges of the screen, like in Windows. Easily worth the 1.09€ for me.\n\n\nUpdate 2019/2020:\nEnded up switching to Divvy. It allows me to place windows anywhere on a customizable grid (kind of like a less aggressive tiling window manager). And I can define custom shortcuts. So I took Magnet’s shortcuts and added a whole bunch of other ones, like centering, top left sixth, bottom quarter, etc.\nIt also allows to set a custom window separation, which I think looks pretty good.\n\n\n\nA: SizeUp\nSizeUp is a window manager app like the others. It costs $12.99 at the time of writing, but offers unlimited free trial (it just reminds you every now and then to pay).\n\nSizeUp allows you to quickly resize and position your windows with keyboard shortcuts or a handy menu bar icon.\n\nIt is not open source, though.\n\nA: Rectangle\nYou can use Rectangle to achieve this for free.\n\nRectangle is a window management app based on Spectacle, written in Swift.\n\nAfter downloading, installing, and granting the app accessibility permissions in System Preferences, you'll be able to enable the default keyboard shortcut scheme, which allows you to press ctrl + opt + U/I/K/J to snap a window to the top left/top right/bottom right/bottom left, respectively. By assigning four windows each to one of these four positions, you can create a four-way split screen view (and if you enable Dock and Menu Bar hiding, you might be able to get a bit more screen real estate, if needed).\n\nA: No - you get two windows in the current implementation. One on the left and one on the right. \nI suppose the notification center slide over could be considered a \"third window\" but you can't put an application window there - it's just a system tray of sorts.\nI would look at a program like Divvy on the Mac App Store for customizing a workspace with multiple tiled windows. It's not split view, but it's far more flexible and able to make use of the 27 inch display space to quite a granular basis.\n\nA: Moom\nThis is my favorite... I have tried quite a few, and paid for them.\nthere is a quick menu on the window\n\nyou can split into blocks which are configurable\n\nand can be triggered when switching displays\n\nthis is the help screen ....\n\n\nA: BetterSnapTool has worked well for me for years\n\nA: Its not the same feautre as Windows, But little bit default Mac feature\nFollow the steps\n\n*\n\n*Four finger down.

There is also a pink tinge to the screen and in safe mode there are red vertical lines an inch thick every inch (inch tinted red inch normal.) I have verbose here before a white screen hang. \n\n\n\nA: I would say that you have a dying/dead discreet GPU, as that's a known problem with your model of MacBook Pro. Booting into safe mode may be doing something to help your GPU (I have an Xserve with a confirmed dying GPU that boots in safe mode but not without it) so it boots properly. I would highly recommend getting your MacBook Pro replaced as soon as possible via the Apple program. I would suggest you run Apple Hardware Test and verify that your GPU is dead/dying, but this may not be possible given your current state. Similarly, you can run a GPU stress test program like Unigine Heaven and see if your GPU quits.\nThe only thing I find interesting is your previous shutdown reason: overheating. According to this post, shutdown code -3 is temperature based. That's strange, but not impossible.\nIn any case, seeing if you can get your computer replaced probably isn't a bad idea since it's pretty likely your GPU is dying. Go to an Apple store, explain the issue, and they'll probably give you a new computer.\n", "Q: Numeric keypad keys in vi insert letters instead of numbers I'm new to vi. Actually I'm using it just to modify small text files. I've a serious and unusual, I think, problem with the numeric keypad, as follow:\nI write vi IN and press enter. This make me access to the file named IN. Then I use arrow keys (or hjkl) to move the cursor through the file. Then I press i to activate the insert mode and write. Here comes the problem: numeric keypad doesn't work properly, since I get pqrstuvwxyl when I press 0123456789+ (,.-*/= still work).\n\nA: As far as I understand, there are two possible modes for number keypads of VT100 terminals: the normal Numeric keypad mode and the Application keypad mode. The latter has the keypad keys send not numbers, but escape sequences. E.g., the '1' key sends <ESC>[Oq,  the '2' key sends <ESC>[Or, of which only the letters q and r are visible on the screen. These are control sequences that the program (host) may interpret as commands for some features. So, in this mode, the keypad keys are practically used as additional function keys.\nIn accordance with the VT100 terminal standard, a program (host) may 'ask' the terminal to switch the keypad to application mode. (It can do this by sending a specific control sequence to the terminal.) Vi and Vim are known to do this. The mode switch is not universal, but on a program to program base: it's only active in the program that requested it. In other programs,  including the shell, the keypad remains in Number mode. The default setting in OS X's Terminal.app is to allow programs to switch to Application mode, which is what you now disabled by un-checking the option \"Allow VT100 application keypad mode\". (BTW: In OS X 10.7 this option is labelled \"Strict VT100 keypad behaviour\".)\nSee also:\nhttp://www.vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html\nhttps://ttssh2.osdn.jp/manual/en/usage/tips/appkeypad.html\n\nA: I solved the problem on my own, but I'd like to know WHY my solution works.\nI deselected the option the red arrow indicates in the following picture\n\nThis is italian, but the english version of the same window is here\nBut I don't recall enabling this but there it is.\n", "Q: Problem activating TargetDisplay Mode for Mac Mini (2014) connected to iMac 21'' (mid-2010) I'm trying to use iMac 21''(mid-2010, Mavericks) as a display for newly purchased Mac Mini (late 2014) and I'm unable to activate TargetDisplay Mode.

Are they able to recover my deleted files? I bring my iPhone to the apple store and they noticed that there's a hardware problem. After 3 days I receive an update from Apple Store and they said that it is already for replacement. I deleted my private files before I give to them.  I just want to ask if they will still recover my files? Like contacts, pictures, videos and memo?\n\nA: Its very hard to say with certainty.\nIf they really wanted to, they could probably recover your files. \nHowever, if you've followed the recommended instructions to erase all content at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201557 and https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201274, the chances are you're probably ok.  \nAlthough Apple goes to some effort to not say that its a secure erase, as a corporation, they are not interested in the liability and legal implications of being able to access those files. They're actually motivated to NOT be able to retrieve them. The fact that this process was slow on old devices also implies that it was a secure erase.\n", "Q: Search for ALL large files and folders (not just some) using Finder (not third-party) I am looking for space! I would like to search for all large folders and files. I found this answer but so far my searches failed to show some of the large files, including a .pkg file that was in my home directory (the 'house' icon). I just use \"normal\" finder, and then with the controls - where I am trying to find a way to say size > 100MB or something to that effect. But I don't even see size.\nI also can not see how to display all folders on my computer where again folder size > 100MB. Are these possible using the Finder controls?\nedit: To address the comments I've added an additional example. It's the selective file type that's bothering me. Here I create some files with python and look with Finder. Finder decides that I should not know about two of the files because the \"Kind\" is \"Document\". If I display the folder, they are there, but Finder won't show them if I'm searching. \nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport json\n\ny = [3,1,5,2,0]\n\nnp.save(\"TestDifferent\", y)\n\nwith open(\"TestDifferent.json\", \"w\") as outfile:\n    json.dump(y, outfile)\n\nwith open(\"TestDifferent.txt\", \"w\") as outfile:\n    outfile.write(str(y))\n\nwith open(\"TestDifferent.weird\", \"w\") as outfile:\n    outfile.write(str(y))\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(y)\nplt.savefig(\"TestDifferent\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: It's possible to search by size using Terminal (Confirmed working on Mojave). \nNo 3rd party tools or hacks.\nHere is a command I used to look through and find largest folders taking my space away (run as root and the command to switch to root is: sudo -i):\ndu -k / | awk '$1 > 500000' | sort -nr\n\nOnce you get the list (ignore the 'Operation not permitted' since those are files you can't (shouldn't) mess with anyway) and look for the top ones.\n\nA: Mac's Finder search limits where your results come from. I'd recommend two solutions, both of which are free (one with a free trial).\nThe first is EasyFind (free) from Devon Technologies and truly searches the entire directory of your Mac. It's vital for getting a true search on your Mac. \nThe second solution is very handy for finding the culprits of large HD space: DaisyDisk (free trial). DaisyDisk will analyze a specified drive and then provide you with an interactive drill down to determine which files exactly are causing the issues.\n\nA: It is not possible to search for folders by file size. The combined size of all files and folders contained in a folder is computed on the fly by Finder when you ask for it.\nFor normal Finder windows, you can enable the option to “Calculate all sizes” in View > View Options. That option is not available for search results.\nWhat you can do is search for files that were recently added to the system and then check the total size of folders where such a files were found. While the file you find using this method may be small, it can be part of a larger collection of files you have downloaded or installed.\nI have written a blog post that shows how to find large files and folders. In the blog post I use HoudahSpot. Full disclosure: I am the developer of HoudahSpot.\nYou can use much the same techniques with Finder. HoudahSpot however makes it easier to set up the search. It also has the ability to show the “total size” of folders as a column in search results. You can also use HoudahSpot to quickly compute the total size of a folder.\nBoth Finder and HoudahSpot search the Spotlight index. Neither will be able to find system files. Yet HoudahSpot will come up with search results that the Finder intentionally hides.\nBTW, if disk space \"went missing” just recently, try restarting your Mac. This will clean up temporary files left behind by applications.\n\nA: Suggest trying Disk Inventory X and it will find files and help you remove large ones:\n", "Q: How can I use Apple Music without my iCloud Library? \n*\n\n*There's no \"reset iCloud library\" button on my account.\n\n*I still want to put 2 albums, that are on my PC, on my phone (they aren't on Apple Music, I've already searched), but when I enable iCloud Library, which  has like 900 songs that I don't want on my cell, there's no way to put them on my phone.\n\n\nI'd like to reset my iCloud Music Library, however I do not know how to or see an obvious way to do it.\n\nA: The best solution to your problem is to set up direct synchronization between your PC and your phone.

The digital audio out port gets stuck (a red glow appears from within the socket).  It is an old MacBook with separate headset & mic ports.  \nI have discounted problems with the speaker as the startup sound goes directly to the built-in speakers.  \nI think the OS controls which functionality the computer decides to use, but consults some hidden hardware in the socket.  The System Preferences can sense but not control the state of the digital audio.  As far as the computer is concerned, it is outputting digital audio and the speaker is disabled.  \nI did try to fix the problem by putting in a digital audio connector, but that didn’t help.  I did find suggestions recommending things like poking a toothpick in the hole and trying to ‘unlatch’ some mechanism which (I assume) senses the presence of the plug.  \nMy next step, unless I get a better idea, is to open the computer case in the hope that I can inspect the port from the inside.  Alternatively, I might try to:\n\n\n*\n\n*look further for software solutions, somehow overriding the computer's belief that something is plugged in; OS X doesn't seem to support this\n\n*mechanically probe from the outside (again)\n\n*get wireless speakers or headset\n\n*get some kind of optical portable or device\n\n*re-organise places I go (I carry a phone headset about, and in one office I keep a cheap pair of Logitech wired speakers.  Some places have Apple TVs.)\n\n*something else I haven't seen yet\nAny ideas about pros and cons?  (I don't have much money to spend and hope to avoid the expensive options above.  I have time, but want to explore more options before opening the case.)\n\nA: I just used a toothpick, flat headed, did a few swirls around inside the port with very light pressure & it just works, now Internal Speakers is available & the default choice in Sound prefs, volume icon is no longer grayed out in menu bar.\n\nA: If you look down the socket while the computer is on, and the back of the socket lit red, then I would try putting a vacuum nozzle to the socket in an attempt to pull out whatever might be stuck back there.\nYou are correct; the operating system normally decides what output to go with. But in this case, the chip that converts digital to analog audio on your logic board will tell OS X when it thinks a mini toslink cable has been inserted, and you will lose the option for 'Internal Speaker' in System Preferences. \nIf the back of the socket is not lit red, then it may in fact be software issue. Perhaps try a PRAM reset?\n\nA: There is no software that is going to fix a physical issue.\nNow, I have never disassembled the audio port on a MBP logic board, but it is safe to say there is a physical connection being made within the jack to tell it either an analog  or an optical jack has been inserted.  It may be some as simple as a mechanical contact (something like a switch) or a photo sensor.  Either way, there is no logic in your headphone jack to tell your MBP \"I'm optical, turn on your red light!\"  It only does so, because a connection was made.\nBecause that connection is made, your audio subsystem is telling OS X that a headset is connected and to reroute all your audio through that device.   There is no software or setting that is going to trick that audio subsystem into not \"believing\" what it is \"seeing.\"  In this case, that connection being made.  Whether what is making that connection is an actual audio device or some gunk  jammed in there is another story altogether.\nAttempt to clean out your port\nI wouldn't use a toothpick.\nTry using compressed air to clean out the port.  If that doesn't work, you can a small spritz of electronic component cleaner  (I have used CRC Quick Dry Cleaner myself) Make sure you do this while the computer is off and unplugged, of course.  Don't apply power until you are sure it's dry.  Wait 1 hour to be sure!!!  Oh...and make sure you read the directions and warnings on the label!\nIf that fails, have a logic board repair specialist look at it.  They can probably replace the component pretty quickly and cheaply.\n\nA: The steps below rely on the following diagnostics being met:\n\n*\n\n*The powerchime on startup works as expected.\n\n*The headphone jack gives out sound when connected to external speakers.\n\n*The internal speakers are silent, in normal operation, when no plug is inserted.\n\n*Without a plug, menu-bar speaker symbol is greyed out and pressing the volume keys produces merely a grey no-parking sign in the speaker HUD\n\n*There is a red light coming from within the plug itself, without a plug inserted\n\n*In 'Audio MIDI Setup.app' as well as in the 'Sound' Preference pane, the status is listed as 'optical digital out'\n\nIf the above conditions are all met\nThere are numerous ways to fix the issue:\nMost of the time the issue is from foreign objects/debris/dust/dirt.\nThe circuits involved giving the system the 'wrong info' about 'what's going on in the port' look somewhat like this:\n\nMeaning: with a regular jack inserted, internal speakers are muted, but sound signals are going out via line. But without a jack inserted, the system lacks the electric contact, the switch is stuck, and the system therefore  assumes 'optical-out present', mutes the internal speakers, and sends out the light into the room.\nThere are in principle three ways to tackle this problem, two rather physical and one angle of attack that relies purely on software and its configurations\n1. Clean out the headphone jack\nThe easiest and sometimes sufficient method is to replug a headphone jack repeatedly out and in again. This fucking works surprisingly often.\nThis may be done with a toothpick, the back of an ink reservoir from a ball pen, tightly wrapped paper towel, a Q-tip— with the latter two preferably dipped in some alcohol (not too much!), some report success with using a small screwdriver.\nAlternatively, some say using compressed air or even blowing with their own lungs into the port. This may depend on the dryness or 'lack of grease' lack of adhesive power of the dirt. Compressed air sometimes did the trick, with 'blowing' I never achieved anything.\nThis all is a bit hit&miss, since I for example do not know the exact orientation of the switch (some say 3 o'clock, no proof, but see below), and most often I cannot see inside what's the problem.\nOne problem may be debris that might be all over the place. But the essential switch seems to be in the horizontal plane towards the lid/display — i.e.: at the 9 o'clock position. So engaging this switch with a match stick or similar should be concentrated on that location.\n2. Physical alterations\nThe alternatives available in order of escalating invasiveness\n\n*\n\n*Replace just the headphone jack (very advanced tinkering, clean & relatively cheap, fixes the exact problem and nothing more, optical is available again as are all options associated with that port, if need be)\n\n\n*Physically disable the SPDIF (even cheaper, but optical will be gone for good in most cases)\n\n\n*Replace the entire logic board (the lazy, wasteful Apple-way. Will fix a tiny problem by shooting sparrows with cannons, often not available, certainly not from Apple if the machine is too old. In short: will work, with overkill)\nNone of these are advisable to for someone inexperienced with soldering trying to fix this at home. The 'entire logicboard' road is extremely wasteful and only an option if the problem would fall into the time window of warranty or AppleCare. (Even then such a simple replacement part…)\nBut: if 'cleaning doesn't work' (if cleaned too often, my impression is that the port tends to fail from stress permanently, ie: even if clean) and if you know someone, or someplace willing to go for 'option 1, just the port please', then that should be a very attractive alternative.\n3. Software based solutions\nThe fact that a Mac stuck in optical can be heard using its internal speakers just fine (with easy configuration steps) in Linux proves that software can be used.\nThere may be a way disable SPDIF via NVRAM commands, but that's still to be found.\nSome solutions that floated around the net involved launching either Sound-PrefPane or Garageband in specific orders turned out to be unsuccessful.\nWorking software solution\nA software-only way entirely in MacOS that does work, although it relies on non-Apple system-level software:\nSupersede AppleHDA.kext with loading VoodooHDA.kext!\nOn a Mojave 10.14 system I used Kext Utility (many shady looking sources on the net, but also available in more trusted Homebrew formula).\n\n*\n\n*Close all other programs\n\n*Open Kext Utility\n\n*Drop the VoodooHDA.kext on its window\n\n*Wait until it says it finished\n\n*Reboot\n\nYou should now have VoodooHDA active and should notice that you now have the option to switch the output in for example the menubar entirely at your will:\n\nThis image shows the state of the menubar selector, with a glitchy headphone port, under pure-Apple stuck in optical without internal speakers, now using the internal speakers again\nThis was done on an older system with SIP disabled. Whether this works as described, with additional hoops to jump through, or not at all in newer systems like Monterey or Ventura: I cannot test that now on this machine. Using such hackerish kexts and tools is altering the security profile of your software.\nFeedback welcome, especially for which systems (still) allow this route, or what alternatives there are to force-bypass SPDIF in software.\n\nA: I scratched around the back of the port (right at the end where the red light source is) with a small screw driver and it reset back to internal speakers.\n", "Q: Alternate to iPhone Configuration Utility for installing Certificates?

Been a lurker for a long time, this is my first question/discussion. I hope somebody might point me in the right direction. \nI was recently given a couple old iMacs that were going to be thrown away by a family member. The others all work fine after a format and memory upgrade. However, one of them does not. It is a 17\" iMac Intel Core Duo 1.83Ghz. Here is a link to the exact model info.\nOn bootup, I get the normal Apple start sound, but the screen only displays multi-colored lines. Here is a picture. I pulled the plastic bezel off, and tried removing the screen panel, and reseating the screen cable. I also removed and reseated the memory, and tried resetting NVRAM, all with no change. I don't need to worry about losing any data on this system, I will format it and clean install OSX when I fix the screen.  \nWhat should I try next to figure out what is causing the screen issue? \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Probably a hardware issue either with the GPU or something between the GPU and the screen (screen itself, cable, etc.) dying. I know you reseated the screen and cable, but if said components are failing/have failed that won't be enough.\nIf you have an external monitor, try plugging it in and see if it works. If so, run Apple Hardware Test and see what it reports back. If you GPU is indeed dying, chances are this won't work. To my knowledge the GPU is attached permanently to the logic board, so you can't replace it.\n", "Q: New SSD problem I've just installed a new SSD replacing an HDD in my old (late 2008) iMac.

Any suggestions? I've got everything backed up on an external Hard Drive, by the way.\n\nA: If you replaced your HDD in your iMac with a new SSD and you try to boot, nothing is going to happen.\nI am assuming you are getting something that looks like this:\n\nThat means your iMac can't find anything to boot off of because your new SSD is completely blank. (You just took it out of the box and exchanged it with the old one, right?)\nCommand + R doesn't work because, again, the drive is blank. You need to have a recovery partition for it to boot to.   You won't be able to do an Internet Recovery either because your iMac is not supported.  Internet recovery support didn't happen until 2011 and only was retroactive to 2010 Macs. \nHow to Install OS X on a new SSD When no the Recovery Partition or Internet Recovery Isn't Available:\nIf you or your son has access to another Mac (it sounds like it), have him download OS X for you (El Capitan is supported) \nCreate a bootable USB flash (you will need an 8GB or larger)\nInstall OS X.

I assume this occurred through iCloud. \nQuestion\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I get those Wifi Passwords back?\n\n*How can I prevent this from happening again?\n\nA: Check to seen if your passwords still exist under Safari > Preferences > Passwords on your Mac. Maybe they are still there.\nIf this doesn't work, try the following: Unplug your router's ethernet cable (so that iCloud cannot sync with the server) and try to restore your from Time Machine. This should revert your Key Chain. I recommend disconnecting your router because if you just turn off your wifi, it will probably turn back on after the restore is done and sync with iCloud again.\n\nA: I don't know how to prevent it from happening, but I fixed it last time by getting a copy of my keychain via TimeMachine and reimporting them.\n", "Q: Is it possible to limit resources to a game? Or forcibly limit the FPS I recently bought and installed a new game through steam 'besiege' if you were wondering, and it ran really hot on my computer. On other games such as CS:GO for example you can cap the FPS in game making my computer not run as hot so less background noise.\nI looked around and for this game there doesn't seem to be this option. (I've had similar problems with other games) My Mac (13\" macbook pro retina 2013) runs at about 90 - 105 degrees with this game and I know the laptop won't be damaged as it'll thermal throttle and turn up the fans but I'd rather have a worse running game and not so much background noise due to the fan running at 6000 rpm...\nMy first thought was limiting the resources the game got, I'm not sure if this would affect the heat produced.\nBut anyways to just make the game run worse to decrease heat output. (It's capped at 60 fps I believe) down to around 20(ish) as this is perfectly bearable visually.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! :D \n\nA: Let's look at the two things you suggested, as these are two separate approaches to solving the issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Limit the resources provided (presumably by limiting the CPU.)\n\n*Cap the framerate\n\n\nLimiting the resources provided is pretty easy (provided you're willing to work with a little bit of third-party software.) You can use cputhrottle to limit the usage at the system level (better explained here.)\nCapping the framerate is generally done at the level of the game. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, there's no way to set your framerate cap either lower or higher right now.  So you're stuck with throttling the CPU, although given what you're trying to do, that seems like a fine option.\n\nA: Volta can limit the power consumption of your processor. Setting the power limit to 25W for example, I can prevent the fans in my MacBook (Mid-2014 15\" Pro with IGP) from spinning up when playing a game. Note that your System Integrity Protection settings need to be adjusted, however.\nOn a related note, Turbo Boost Switcher allows disabling Turbo Boost, limiting the clock frequency of the processor. In my experience, it doesn't always help to stop the CPU fan going to full blast.\n\nA: Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but have you checked out Can I manually limit the %CPU used by a process?\n", "Q: Do not want my iPad to sync w iPhone. Why can I not stop sharing iCloud, as opposed to deleting it, which I believe will affect other device? For example, my apps r showing up on his phone, but his stuff is not coming to mine. If I delete my iCloud, am I also deleting his? All under same account.\n\nA: If you are talking about the App Store, the important thing is the AppleID you used to sign in. Assuming two devices both signed in with the same id, the default behavior is: when you make a purchase on device A, it is installed on device B at the same time. Downloading an already-purchased app does not propagate. Deleting an app does not propagate. iCloud data associated with the app is not deleted if you delete the app from only one device.\nYou can disable the \"purchases installed everywhere\" choice from the Settings > iTunes & App Store page.\n", "Q: Display S.M.A.R.T. statistics for an SSD? I purchased a couple of used Intel 320-series 160 GB SSDs. I attached one of the drives to my MacBook Pro running OS X 10.8 using a SATA III to USB 3.1 cable.\nWhen I attempted to view the drive statistics, it resulted in S.M.A.R.T. Status: Not Supported.\n\nI'm fairly certain S.M.A.R.T. Status: Not Supported is wrong. According to Intel Solid-State Drive 320 Series, S.M.A.R.T. is supported. From the document (section 5.4):\n\nThe Intel SSD 320 Series supports the SMART command set, which\n  consists of:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*SMART READ DATA\n  \n*SMART READ ATTRIBUTE THRESHOLDS\n  \n*SMART ENABLE/DISABLE ATTRIBUTE AUTOSAVE\n  \n*SMART SAVE ATTRIBUTE VALUES\n  \n*SMART EXECUTE OFF-LINE IMMEDIATE\n  \n*SMART READ LOG SECTOR\n  \n*SMART WRITE LOG SECTOR\n  \n*SMART ENABLE OPERATIONS\n  \n*SMART DISABLE OPERATIONS\n  \n*SMART RETURN STATUS\n  \n*SMART ENABLE/DISABLE AUTOMATIC OFFLINE\n  \n\nHow do I display the S.M.A.R.T. statistics for the SSD under OSX 10.8?\n\nA: Getting  the SMART status is possible with these disks but not if they are attached to USB. The necessary ATA commands usually aren't propagated through the USB-controller.\nYou can try to get that working though by using OS X SAT SMART Driver.\n", "Q: Can't login to Gmail via Mail on iOS I am having trouble accessing my Gmail account via Mail on my iPad. It keeps saying my username or password is incorrect when it's not. I have that rotten two-step authentication turned off and this is still happening. How do I fix this?\n\nA: If you do have two-step verification enabled you can just go to the App passwords page to generate an app-specific password, although you shouldn't need it on recent versions of iOS / OS X.\nIf you are sure that two-step verification is turned off I suggest to verify your password. And if you're 100% sure it's correct try changing your password, or if turned off recently turning two-step verification back on.\n", "Q: Apple Airport Extreme AC True Wireless Roaming? Just a quick question to people who use airport extreme's / express's to extend the coverage of their wireless. I've seen this referred to as wireless roaming..\nMy question, is this true wireless roaming? Will the clients automatically roam between access points without any packet loss (like some small business of enterprise solutions with a wireless controller) or is there a brief period of re-connection while you move around to your closest access point?\nCheers!\n\nA: You're always on the same IP network with the same IP address, you're just changing the radio transmitter you're exchanging those packets with. The computer automatically finds the strongest signal and changes it's connection fluidly as long as all the base stations have the same wifi name.\nFor best performance I strongly recommend ethernet hardwiring wifi access points whenever possible rather than extending a wireless network via repeating.\n\nA: The answer to your question is not as simple as it looks.\nWhen the smart guys at NCR designed the footprint of what eventually became the 802.11 standard back in the early 90's, roaming was a feature high on the wish list.  It was all but perfectly integrated back then, but 25 years of fine tuning resulted in quite seamless transitions.\nAssuming your wireless environment is well set up; AP's are nicely overlapping and have different channels assigned to them there will be indeed some disruption in the data stream when re-associating between different Access Points.  But these transitions are low level and chances are next to none that your application will suffer from these transitions.\nOnce your laptop decides to re-associate,\n\n\n*\n\n*It issues one or more disassociation frames to the current AP to\ninitiate the re-association process.\n\n*It broadcasts a probe request for alternative AP's to pick up.\n\n*It decides which AP has the best conditions to connect to.\n\n*The new AP will issue a probe response, authentication and association frames will be exchanged\n\n\nAll of this actions generally take place within 50ms or so and will happen more frequently when signal levels are considered 'poor'.  \nYou asked whether you'll get packet loss or brief period of re-connection gaps.  Technically the answer is yes, but as said before, it won't necessarily interrupt 'human' service.\nAs long as you're not using general QoS sensitive considered applications you won't notice.  A voip call might give the odd extra delay once in a while and streaming video might freeze up for a couple frames.  Basically the same stuff that might happen when the wireless network is overloaded or when you have the odd collision on your wired network.  But on human being level you won't see disruptions in your webbrowser, FTP download, etc.  You won't get kicked off your Netflix or Skype service. \nAll good news?  Not quite.  You're talking about an Airport Extreme featuring AC technology, and Airport Express'es which currently only have N-technology and are not available with AC.  While the roaming on both technologies are subjected to the 802.11 standard there is no difference.  But on speed there most definitely is.\nAdditionally AC equipped devices have in general much better antennas which might give other issues.  Also the AC equipped Macbooks have better antennas.  In a traditional setup, Express'es are wireless extenders, getting their network wireless and repeat (sic).  Placing them in an ideal overlapping position will be quite a task.  And even then the question is whether your Macbook will actually prefer N at x dB or the AC at x+y dB.\nAs you see the more extreme your setup is, the more your chances are to end up in a vacuum.  If you're indeed at - or outside - the edge of the AC/N coverage areas, maybe you should opt for using additional Extreme's instead of Express'es.\n", "Q: iPhone not turning on when pressing lock button/erroneous charging When I try to turn on my phone by holding the lock button, it doesn't turn on. It just stays dead. \nBut when I connect the Lightning cable, all it does is show the battery symbol, then go to the Apple logo, and repeats.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Let it charge overnight, if the behavior is the same you could try another charger and/or cable as it is possible that you have a bad charger or cable. \nFailing all of that it is likely that the battery in the phone is kaput and needs to be replaced.\nIf you are in warranty, take it to an Apple store. If it is not in warranty you could do the same, or if you know of a reputable phone repair shop they can do it as well.\n", "Q: How to grep with filename highlighted in one color, and the match highlighted in another color? On the Mac, I can't seem to use grep and have the filename highlighted (or in) a certain color, and have the matching string in a different color.  Is there an easy way?\n\nA: OS X grep is too outdated: it does not support this.\nYou need to install a newer version, for example from HomeBrew\nbrew install grep\n\nBy default, the newly installed grep is called ggrep.\nYou can change this behavior by adding the option --with-default-names.\nFor more information, see https://superuser.com/a/419527.\n\nA: Pipe your grep through awk, then have awk color the fields.\nExample:\ngrep -i \"stuff\" * | awk -F: '{ printf \"\\033[1;31m\" $1 \" \\033[0m\"; for(i=2;i<=NF;i++){out=out\":\"$i}; print out}'\n\n\nA: This is already answered on stackoverflow:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/17236005/grep-output-with-multiple-colors\nbut it only works if you can match the filenames using a pattern or several patterns.\n\nA: Using gnu grep with the option --color=auto I got both colored search term and file name. For example:\nggrep --color=auto -r 'searchKeyWord'\n\nIf you want to always get this behavior you can add an alias in ~/.bash_profile\nalias grep=\"ggrep --color=auto\"\n\nAnd use the grep command as usual\ngrep -r 'searchKeyWord'\n\nTo install gnu grep check @Fabrice answer.\n", "Q: Mouse clicks not working on MacBook Pro, with both track pad and USB mouse This evening the left mouse button on the track pad on my MacBook Pro stopped working.\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebooted.  No change.\n\n*Zotted PRAM.  No change.\n\n*Reset SMC.  No change.\n\n*Connected USB wired mouse.  No change.\n\n\nI've found various discussions of the trackpad mouse buttons not working, but many of the suggestions suggest using a physical wired mouse.  But right now it's ignoring both.  \nHardware:\nMacbook Pro 1,2 (17\" 2006)\nExternal Mouse apple small roller ball middle button (Mighty mouse?)\nVerified that the external mouse worked on another computer.\nVerifed that the battery is not swelling.  Track mouse clicks.  Just doesn't do anything.\nWhat do I need to check next?\n\nA: Here is what worked for me.\nI am on a MBP Retina 13\" Late 2013 and macOS Sierra. The pointer started to have erratic movements and generated automatic clicks. Then this stopped but the left click would not work at all, even with an external mouse (only the right click of the mouse worked).\nI tried everything (NVRAM reset,...) but nothing worked.\nThen I found a post (here) linking it to an issue with an external monitor - I plugged the HDMi of the external screen I use from time to time, turned the monitor on and voila !, the left click worked again !\nThe post is 3 years old but he bug seems to be surviving...\n\nA: I tries all the above methods and found if I disconnected all other WiFi keyboards & trackpads connected to the computer, the problem went away, at least for this time.\n\nA: Turned out there was a bluetooth mouse that it was paired to.  Mac OS doesn't define the results when a mouse is paired to more than one device.  When I moved the laptop upstairs so I could do searches on my main computer while experimenting on the laptop, it 'lost' the connection and would respond to the trackpad clicker.  I immediately turned off bluetooth.\nFor reasons that escape me Snow Leopard will ignore clicks from all other mice if it has a bluetooth mouse 'connected'  Since you can have any number of wired mice that are fully functional, this is just bizarre.\nI was unable to turn off bluetooth using just the keyboard.  While I did discover keyboard shortcuts to open up system preferences, and navigate to the Bluetooth panel, I was unable to move out of the search text box on preferences.  Command F7 had no effect.\nSo at this point my answer is:\nTake the Macbook for a walk.  Eventually it loses the connection and you can turn off bluetooth.\nBad answer.  \n\nA: This is not an answer but BT has nothing to do with it. I haven't had BT enabled since I got my MB in 2011. \nThe click works some of the time and not at others.\nI keep my box clean and make sure all the edges of the track pad are clear.\nThe mechanical movement is full range but the click comes and goes.\nAll other pad functions are normal.\n", "Q: Open an ssh session in terminal with BetterTouchTool I was hoping to configure a keystroke command using BetterTouchTool to open a terminal window and run an ssh session. I do this a lot to connect to a RaspberryPi on my network.

So what would be the best method for me to open a terminal window and execute ssh pi@10.0.0.x in that window?\n\nA: So, if I understand you correctly, you want to just click on a shortcut on your Desktop (or somewhere else) that will open Terminal.app and connect to a particular host via SSH.\nThe quickest way would be to create an AppleScript that opens Terminal and executes the command ssh <user>@<ipaddress>\nFirst...

Here the primary [boot] and Time Machine drives are not shared by default.  This is what I want but I don't want to install OS X Server to get this.\nI am thinking that there must be a way to do this as both OS X and OS X Server are using /usr/sbin/AppleFileService to provide AFP service and so the difference must be happening somewhere else (or the default behavior has changed between OS X 10.8 to 10.11).\nDoes anyone know how to do this?\n\nA: Issuing the following command and restarting /usr/sbin/AppleFileServer would seem to have been the solution.\n$ sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.AppleFileServer admin31GetsSp -boolean true\n\nIt wasn't.

It's been about half a year since I moved from an iPhone to a Windows Phone. This was a particularly difficult decision, as play counts are extremely important to me but non-Apple devices don't sync media play counts with iTunes. (More on this in a bit.)\nBut I switched anyway, and I bought a 4th-generation iPod shuffle as a replacement for the Music app on my iPhone as well as a cool little fashion accessory in my favorite color. I never listen to any music from my iTunes library on my Windows Phone; the only music-related thing I do with it is watch music videos on the Internet — I don't store any music videos on iTunes anyway.\nIn the six and a half years I'd been using an iPhone, play counts and other metadata synced perfectly with iTunes (well, except when it was completely fudged in iOS 8.0 until it was fixed several months later in iOS 8.1.1). Not so with my iPod shuffle; I've noticed that when I sync, sometimes the play counts, skip counts and last played/skipped dates update, and other times they don't even though I could have sworn I've been listening to my music all day.\nWhat gives?\n\nA: I didn't think of posting this question until today but after a few weeks of experimentation, I've determined that, for some strange reason, iPod shuffle will only update play metadata when, before my next sync, I either\n\n\n*\n\n*finish listening to a playlist, or\n\n*switch from one playlist to another.\n\n\nIf I don't finish listening to a playlist (which can be the case with very large playlists), the metadata will not be updated on iTunes.\nPowering iPod shuffle off and on between listens does not appear to make a difference, but I'll report back with any new findings. For what it's worth, in normal use, these are the steps I take when preparing to sync:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off iPod shuffle by sliding the three-way switch to OFF.\n\n*Disconnect the earphones.\n\n*Connect iPod shuffle to the USB cable.\n\n*Sync.\n\n\nAnd of course I always eject it from iTunes before disconnecting it.\n\nA: Apparently it works to tick the 'Auto fill' option in the ipod 'Music' menu. I have not been able to actually test this, and this is pretty annoying if you only want a couple of hours of music on your ipod and have to fill it with some 300 songs. \nI have noticed that with certain very long tracks, ipod never syncs the play count. With other tracks, it seems to be random, yet the exception, luckily. Still, it is bl**dy annoying, and seems like a very simple thing to fix for a multizillion company like Apple.\n", "Q: Extract photo from Live Photo I recently backed up all my iPhone 6s photos to my media server (running Linux).

Most seem to be dealing with daisy chaining two external displays off of a single DisplayPort, but this MacBook Pro has two ports, so no daisy chaining.\nAny thoughts on why the two different resolutions?\n\nA: My guess is that it's in the DisplayPort to VGA not supporting a high enough resolution–although 800x600 is rather low, there's not a hard rule for VGA.

I have a 2009 Mac Pro 4.1, with the following specifications:\n2 2.93 GHz Quad-core Intel Xenon processors\n32 GB   RAM\n2   1 TB HD\n1   MacPro Raid Card \n1   Nvidia GeForce GT 120 512 MB\nThe work I do benefits from lots of screen real estate. Prior to switching to the Mac Pro, I used a pair of 27\" iMacs extending my desktop across the two displays.\nI have started thinking about whether I could/should get a 50” 4K Ultra HD LED TV and use it as monitor. The size would work well in my office and it would give me more square inches of display than the pair of iMacs.\nI know little about graphics cards and displays, but I understand that a want both a display and a graphics card to support 60Hz to deal with things like cursor/mouse movement delays.\nMy work is mostly text and some screen drawing, but no extensive graphics. Recreationally, some video's.\nSo, some questions. \nDoes a 50” 4K Ultra HD LED TV as monitor make sense? \nPositives vs Negatives?\nOther recommendations?\nWhat graphics card(s) will work in the Mac Pro for what I want to cobble together?\nAny suggestions on the best value given my use?\n\nA: TL;DR: Don't get a TV, get (almost) whatever graphics card you want\nUsing a TV as a monitor\nLet's start with this issue. There's nothing inherently wrong with using a TV as a monitor, but it's probably not a good purchasing decision.\nHere are the issues I'll go over:\n\n\n*\n\n*Physical space\n\n*Usability\n\n*Resolution and PPI\n\n*Color\n\n*Response time\n\n*Price\n\n\nLet's start from the top and work our way down.\nAssuming you have the physical space to fit a 50\" beast, you're fine. With that said, you'll probably be tilting you head up a lot, as you'll have more vertical space then you'll probably want. You'd be better off with a wider aspect ratio or a combo of narrower monitors placed side by side to minimize strain.\nYou'll obviously be losing out on some nice features of a monitor if you use a TV: certain inputs, USB hubs, onboard audio, better out-of-the-box color calibration, nicer stand/buttons/bezel, support for easy brightness changes, etc. These are the sorts of things you can probably work around, but might be annoying.\nEven at 4k (3840x2160), with a 50\" TV, you'll be at a mere 88.12 DPI. That's not awful (72 DIP is generally considered the minimum), but it's not good (the 1440p iMac was at 108.79), and you'll probably notice. You'd probably be happier spending that same money on a smaller display with higher PPI, even at the expense of total resolution or screen space.\nColor on modern TVs is generally quite good–especially if you go the OLED route–but out-of-the-box calibration may vary (although this happens with monitors as well.) However, it sounds like you don't really care, so this isn't something too important.\nOne place where you're very likely to suffer is with response time. TVs usually have awful response times, some above 100 MS. That's getting to the point where it may be legitimately annoying even for some work. Given that you're not gaming, you'll be fine with a higher response time, but still, make sure you know what you're getting.\nPrice. This can go either way. You can easily spend more either way depending what you get. But the chances are, you won't save by getting a TV.\nWith that said, all this will change based on exactly what TV you get. But this is a pretty fair generalization.\nOne final word of advice though: you said you had two 27\" iMacs. Why not use those using Target Display Mode? You won't be spending any more money and you'll have two beautiful iMacs with a lot of real estate. Throwing that out is throwing out good money. You can get a few more monitors on top of that, but you don't need to replace them.\nTL;DR: Use yo iMacs, and if you really need more real estate, buy a proper monitor.\nGraphics Card\nGraphics cards + Mac Pro = fun.\nThere are two kinds of graphics cards we'll be looking at here: flashed and unflashed cards.\nFlashing is the process of putting a different piece of firmware on a graphics card. Why would you need to do that? Well, if you've ever looked at a Mac graphics card, they're very expensive compared to their PC counterparts. Generally, the only difference is what firmware is on there. Most PC cards can be reflashed with the Mac firmware. I'll drop this here as further reading that does a much better job explaining what I'm trying to get at.\nSound too complicated? Don't worry, you probably don't need to flash your card at all. Most modern cards (usually AMD Tahiti and newer, Nvidia is a bit weird) will work without being flashed once you get to the OS X desktop. This does mean though that certain things won't work (your screen will be black until you finish booting for example.)\nIf you want a Mac card that's flashed without the hassle, you can pay MacVidCards to do it for you. They charge a decent amount, but they have solid firmwares that work.\nOutside of making sure it works with your Mac, just get whatever is appropriate for your workload. It doesn't sound like you need a lot of power but like pushing a lot of pixels, so a mid-tier graphics card should work.\nTL;DR: Get the appropriate card, it'll probably work.\nFinal Words\nFeel free to add comments and I'll respond to them. There's a lot of subjective content here, so what's best for you != what's best for the average person.\n\nA: Get an AMD Radeon R9 380X 3Gig Video card for your Mac Pro 2009-2012.

I have an iPad mini (1st gen) I want to give it to a family member, so I operated a full system backup and reset. I have all the photos from the iPad inside of my library on OSX (in the Photos app).\nI now want to put all these photos back into the iPad, so I did this (selected \"Copy photos from photos\" and checked \"all the photos\" with \"include video\") and synced:\n\nHowever, there are more than 1.808 photos/videos in my library.

Zombies 2 Chinese Version).\n\nA: You have to make another apple account, there are tons if tutorials for that. When you get to verify or review or something on your iPhone you need to choose the country. You may not find \"China\" but at the end of the list is China written in Chinese (translate China via google and it works).\nWhen you get to the address you must write like I did:\n\n\nA: To download apps available for certain region, you will need an Apple ID assigned to this region. Most likely, you won't be able to change your region from the United States to China as you don't have a valid Chinese address and credit card issued in China. YOUR only option is to create a new Apple ID. Once you create an Apple ID, you will be prompted to select your country, this is where you should choose China, not the USA.\nBelow you will find the instructions:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201389\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203993\n\nA: As far as I know, you need to have a valid Chinese address and a Chinese credit card.\n\nA: I figured it out.\nWhen you go to change your country and it asks for a credit card, just click bank card instead and it lets you continue with no card numbers.\n", "Q: Does USB-C charge your device (laptop/phone) while connected to a plugged-in display? Given that the new Macbook has only one USB-C port, can you indefinitely run your laptop while connected to a TV?\nLet's say a TV run on electricity from a wall power outlet. You connect your macbook to it and play a video from your macbook to be displayed on the TV. \nDoes USB-C keep your macbook charged while connected to a device that has its own power source? Or will I need to disconnect the macbook from the TV, charge for a while, and then connect it back to the TV once the macbook gets charged enough?\nWhat about if the macbook is connected to a display that run on battery power? Will the macbook charge the display (e.g. tablet),  the tablet charge the macbook, or be power-neutral?\n\nA: If you want to run a TV or external display from a MacBook, you need an adaptor. And the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adaptor has HDMI, USB and USB-C ports, so you can connect the MacBook's power adaptor to the USB-C port while you use the HDMI port to drive the external display. The external display won't power the MacBook itself.\n", "Q: How Do I Create a Named Fork and Store Data In It? It says here...\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(file_system)#Apple\n...that the HFS+ file system in OSX supports \"multiple named forks\". How do I create a named fork at command line, and then how do I store data in it? Also, what are the maximum number of bytes I can place in my named fork?\n\nA: I don't know about named forks except the resource fork. I can create it like so in Terminal (Bash shell):\necho \"data fork area\" > /tmp/test.txt\necho \"resource fork area\" > /tmp/test.txt/..namedfork/rsrc\ncat /tmp/test.txt\ncat /tmp/test.txt/..namedfork/rsrc\n\nI don't know about size limitations.\nYou can also copy a binary executable into the resource fork, and extract the bytes back out into a file, and execute that file:\ncp /usr/bin/whoami > /tmp/test.txt/..namedfork/rsrc\n# get ready for some bells to sound in your terminal\ncat /tmp/test.txt/..namedfork/rsrc > /tmp/test.bin\nchmod u+x /tmp/test.bin\n/tmp/test.bin\n\nNote that the whoami command is kind of weird when you do this because it's really the id command, and so when you restore it, it reverts to the id command and you can do man id to learn more about that.\n\nA: Extended attributes is what you're looking for.  xattr will allow you to view and modify extended attributes at the command line.  Look at the man page for more details, but in brief you can write one with the following command\nxattr -w com.foo.myattribute \"A bunch of data\" /path/to/file\n\nA: \"Named forks\" is something Apple was planning to implement but (as far as I can tell) never actually did. (Or at least not in OS X – I'm unsure about Classic MacOS 8/9). macOS contains various historical remnants of that earlier plan (such as the /..namedfork/rsrc syntax, the ATTR_FILE_FORKLIST file attribute supported by the getattrlist API, etc). Eventually, Apple decided to implement extended attributes instead (in MacOS X 10.4 Tiger).\nAmong filesystem designers, there is a philosophical dispute about how best to support arbitrary custom metadata – \"named forks\" and \"extended attributes\" represent those two different approaches. Microsoft Windows is a rather unusual example of a system which implements both – it calls named forks \"alternate data streams\" (or just \"streams\" for short).\nThe key difference is what the API to manipulate this metadata looks like:\n\n*\n\n*named forks/streams: these are essentially hidden \"sub-files\" which can be attached to a file, and which a programmer can read/write using the same APIs as ordinary data files. One may need to invoke some special API to list them, but you can open them just like a normal file (often using some special syntax: Apple was planning on /..namedfork/, Windows just uses a : to separate the file name from fork/stream name). They have the same size limits as ordinary files–you can have a 1KB data file with a 1GB named fork/stream attached.\n\n*extended attributes: each file has named key-value pairs, and has a \"get attribute\"/\"set attribute\" API to access them. You cannot open/read/write these named attributes using the same API calls you use for ordinary files. The file APIs do not accept any special path syntax to refer to them. There is usually a limit on their size, much smaller than that for ordinary data files (kilobytes or megabytes rather than gigabytes)\n\n(As an aside, Solaris unfortunately confuses things by adopting essentially the first approach but calling it \"extended attributes\" – and the NFSv4 protocol inherited that terminology from Solaris.)\nMy educated guess is that Apple was internally trying to make up its mind between those two options, and originally was aiming at the first, but before they'd actually shipped the first option, changed their mind to the second, and the second is what actually ended up shipping.\nApple reused some of the filesystem data structures in HFS Plus originally intended to support \"named forks\" to implement \"extended attributes\". Given that fact, and given that \"extended attributes\" is the replacement for \"named forks\", you will occasionally find people treating the two terms as synonyms, making statements such as \"ls -@ lists named forks\". While I understand the reasons for doing that, I think it causes confusion, because the vestigial APIs in macOS which were intended to support named forks don't work for extended attributes.\n", "Q: Do iPhones come with recently used emojis? Do iPhones come with emojis already in the \"recently used\" area? Like preset in that area? \n\nA: As per your question, it seems you are interested with the most frequently used emoji.

When you tap the emoji which you use often, it will be shown in your keyboard which called \"frequently used\".\n", "Q: XCode Problem - Couldn't load settings from contents.xcplayground I recently moved a few playground files from my documents folder to iCloud Drive. Then I noticed they all the files have been duplicated and non can be opened.\nI moved them back to the original location to the documents folder and still they don't open.\nAny suggestions on how I can bring back the codes I've written?\n\nUPDATE:\nI had a copy of one of the files in my dropbox. It turns out the playground file, consists of a few files and some files were missing or didn't get uploaded to iCloud. (iCloud bug? Shame!) \nSo then I took a look at the contents (right click > show package contents) and found a swift file which had my code in it.\n\n\nA: This happens when you zip and unzip files and Mac turned some files into .xml file depend on your mac settings. The solution is:\nright-click the \"xxx.playground\" file -> show package content, you will see the \"contents.xcplayground\" file. Right-cilck this file and go to \"Get info\". Now in file name and extension section, remove the .xml at last.\nDo the same for \"contents.xcworkspacedata\" under the \"playground.xcworkspace\" workspace folder.\n\nA: I encountered the same problem after moving my iOS development project folders from one place on my internal HDD to another.  I used a command line terminal window to navigate into my PlayGround folder and drilled town to:\nPlayGround/20160519.playground/playground.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/userName.xcuserdatad\nFinding UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate at the bottom of this path, I edited it and updated a number of file paths according to the folder reorganization I'd done.  I then navigated to 20160519.playground and opened it with Xcode.  This time I didn't get the error; instead it gave me a Loading... message but the load never completed.\nI think I'm on the right track to working around Xcode's location rigidity problem but there's apparently a detail or 2 more to find and update according to my folder reorganization.\n\nA: In my case, I had some old playground files which gave the following error when trying to open them in a newer version of Xcode:\n\nPlayground file is missing a \"Contents.swift\" file.\n\nMy solution was to right-click on the playground file and select Show Package Contents. In my package file, I found a file called section-1.swift.\n\nI renamed this file to Contents.swift. After that I was able to successfully open the playground file.\n", "Q: Is Mackeeper scam/malware? Please give me advice! I'm not very computer literate, so I need some help with my computer and thought the application will help me to remove the duplicates and other unwanted things from the hard drive. However, I saw many negative reviews on the Net. I'm very frustrated. Thank you!\n\nA: Depending on where you got it from, it's either malware or just useless. You should uninstall it either way.\nAlthough the official version of MacKeeper isn't directly harmful usually and doesn't qualify as typical malware, it doesn't do any good–and in some cases, may actually remove files it shouldn't. There are much better apps for \"cleaning\" your computer, like CleanMyMac 3, MalwareBytes Anti-Malware, AppCleaner, etc. They've also been the subject of data leaks and class-action lawsuits. Many versions are not clean copies, with other viruses of various sorts loaded on disguised as part of MacKeeper.\nSo how to get rid of it? MacWorld has a pretty good guide, but I'll skip some of it in favor of just downloading MalwareBytes Anti-Malware and letting it do it's job in case some other stuff got installed as well. Let it run, and once it's done, if there are any remaining traces, quit any relevant process and move them to the trash and empty said trash.\nOverall, it's a good idea not to click on advertisements if you don't understand entirely what they're advertising. uBlock Origin is a good content blocker that does a good job blocking ads if you'd like to refrain from accidentally reinstalling it in the future. Still, nothing is guaranteed: make sure you know what you're clicking on and giving access to before you do.\n\nA: After doing some research on the topic, I can say MacKeeper is legit.

Since I only use my Mac for work stuff, I figured I'd just redefine the App Shortcuts from the keyboard menu so I could use control+C, control+V, etc.\nThis works fine in almost every app I've tried, except Microsoft Outlook. There control+C works, but control+V does not. I can copy selected text just fine, but Paste exhibits some weird behavior.\nHitting control+V causes the cursor to jump several lines down and scroll the e-mail. I can continue hitting control+V until the cursor reaches the very end of the e-mail, at which point I can now paste again. The entire time, the menu shows the correct shortcut:\n\nThe Edit menu does not flash (and no other menu flashes either) signaling that a keyboard shortcut in that menu has been pressed until the cursor is at the very end of the document.\nAnd I have everything set up correctly in keyboard settings:\n\nUnsurprisingly, ⌘+V also doesn't work because that's not a valid shortcut anymore.\nHas anybody found a solution for this issue?\nEdit: Turns out it's not just Outlook that has this issue. Several OSX applications will view CTRL+V as a \"scroll down\" operation.\n\nA: Here's what worked for me:\nCreate DefaultKeyBinding.dict under ~/Library/KeyBindings (Create KeyBindings folder if it doesn't exists)  Then paste the contents below into that file:\n  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n  <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n  <plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n          <key>^v</key>\n          <string>noop:</string>\n  </dict>\n  </plist>\n\nAlternately, you can use the following, non-XML syntax (this is the entire contents of the file, and any other keybindings would go inside the curly braces):\n{\n    \"^v\" = noop:;\n}\n\nRestart Outlook, and all other affected programs, and ctrl + v should no longer scroll down.\n", "Q: Can’t add clock to world clock widget in El Capitan Whenever I try to add a clock to the World Clock widget in the Today area of Notification Center, it never gets added.

I know many others have had this issue when updating from iOS 7 to 9, and some found a fix, but before I'm prepared to wipe my iPad and depart with my data, I'd like to try to salvage as much of it as I can. Unfortunately, I was foolish and forgot to back up my iPad before I updated because I figured the update would go flawlessly, since it had been so smooth on my iPhone.\nThe challenge now is to try to gather as much data as I can before wiping. So far, I've been able to get my photos through the Photos application on my Mac running Yosemite, but I'd really like to get all of my data from the Notes app off of my iPad. In order to do so, I've used a few file managers, but can't find the directory anywhere, so it must be in root. Getting access to root would give me access to a lot of other data as well, so that would be ideal. But I know that root access is something you can only gain by jailbreaking, and I don't think my glitching iPad is even capable of being jailbroken at this point.\nGiven all of this, is it possible to get any other data off of my iPad before I wipe it? If so, how? Would jailbreaking help? And how would I jailbreak with my iPad in this state?\n\nA: All relevant data is in /var/mobile/. You don't need anything from /. The Notes database in particular is located at /var/mobile/Library/Notes/notes.sqlite. Without knowing anything else about your situation, the most effective way for you to backup your data might be to just copy over the entire /var/mobile/ directory.\nAlso, only versions of iOS 9.1 and lower can be jailbroken at the time of writing. And no, you can't restore to iOS 9.1.\nAnother thing you could try is to go into Recovery Mode, backup with iTunes, update to the latest version of iOS while still in Recovery Mode, and then restore your iTunes backup.\n", "Q: Quick way to toggle between \"Larger Text\", \"Default\", and \"More Space\" on Macbook Retina On Macbook's with retina display you are able to select between 4 different scale modes as showed in the picture below\n\nIt takes some clicks to get into the Display settings and choosing a new scale. I guess I am not the only one changing the scale frequently so I am confident that an easier solution to this exists. \nQuestion:\nAre there any keyboard shortcuts that toggles the different scale modes without the need of third party software? \n\nA: You can use Automator to script things like that since OS X does't include a built in command key for that option. Once it's scripted, you can then assign a key shortcut to that script/action.\nOpen automator and search for the \"watch me do\" action for scripting of the UI.\nRelevant tutorials are at https://macosxautomation.com/automator/foo.html\n\nA: I highly recommend using SwitchResX. You can easily switch resolutions from the menu bar instead of going through the Settings.app and you can set hotkeys for predefined resolutions/configurations as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n", "Q: How can you switch users at the login screen, without administrator access, with only one local account (the administrator) and many network accounts? Sometimes, a network account is logged in, and the user doesn't/forgets to log out. When someone else uses this computer, the lock screen shows. The only options that I know of from here are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click cancel, which does not switch the user\n\n*Force shutdown the Mac by holding down the power button\n\n*Find their password, login, and logout\n\n\nIf I had an administrator, I could (probably) add another dummy local user account, and it would show a user account switcher, but I don't have admin access.\nHow can I switch the network account without admin access other than the above methods?\n\nA: As long as it is ok to forcibly log-out the user, you just need to to logon as the local admin using Apple Remote Desktop (available in the App Store) or ssh (through a terminal), and kill that user's loginwindow process.  You must login to the computer and not simply \"Share screen\" from Finder.  Then you will be able to login.  \nHere's a really easy-to-read article about this.\nOf course, for either of those options to work, you have to enable Remote Login and Remote Management in \"Sharing\" under the System Preferences.  The Sharing menu is shown below:  \nIf you would rather use fast-user-switching, which I personally don't like because it can often really slow down your computer, then you can set up an \"logout user after x minutes of activity\" option in the System Preferences -> Security & Privacy, which will return you to a login screen.  There may also be nice hacks if you search around, that allow you to get the user-switching icon or a keyboard shortcut setup to do a fast-switch, or trigger a switch or logout by tweaking a call to CGSession, although that may have been possible only in older OSX versions.  There is a huge discussion of many other ideas in that last link as well.\n", "Q: How To Resume OS X El Capitan download after shutting down MacBook Air? I went to download the OS X El Capitan on my MacBook Air. Yesterday I've downloaded 2GB with 256kbps download speed. After downloading it all day, time to let the MacBook Air rest. This morning I went to open my MacBook Air, to the Apps Store, clicked the Free Upgrade. That time I was thinking: \"Why is it not the resume button? Uh oh, something's not right.\" Typed in my password, download started, but from 0% Help? D:\n\nA: You can't resume the download after a shutdown. But your MacBook Air doesn't need to \"rest\". So start the download again and don't shut down the MacBook until it's finished, even if it takes days.\n\nA: That's horrible! Yeah, you usually can't resume after a shutdown.\nIf the reason you needed to shutdown was because your computer was getting hot, what you can do is take two pencils and put them underneath your computer so it has better air flow. But you actually don't need to worry about this because computers have build it over-heat protection and can shutdown on their own if they get too hot.\nOn a side note, you don't really need to shutdown often on a Mac. I normally only shutdown once or twice a week, but usually only because I need to use Windows in Boot Camp.\n", "Q: How to disable horizontal scrolling on OS X Yosemite's Preview?

I have read many solutions,  re-indexed Spotlight search couple of times, and restarted the machine several times.  But the free space is still the same. Can anyone please help me? \n\nA: File Clearing\nAs user2277872 mentioned it's probably a good idea to get a disk analysis application to find out what's eating up your disk space. A few good applications to start with are DaisyDisk, OmniDiskSweeper and Disk Inventory X, each available here, here and here respectively.\nIf you find no big files cluttering up your space, here's another link covering some things that might be using up your disk space that you may have overlooked: http://www.howtogeek.com/184091/5-ways-to-free-up-disk-space-on-a-mac/\n\nPartition Resizing\nHowever, if your 43 available GBs are on your Windows partition, no amount of file deletion on the Mac partition is going to help. What you need to do is resize the partitions.\nDisclaimer: it's always a good idea to make a backup. In theory, no data should get deleted but things can always go wrong. Grab an external HDD and image your system onto it, or at least copy your important files over.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery (Cmd-R on startup) and open Disk Utility.\n\n*Select your parent drive for both your Mac and Windows partitions (assuming they're on the same physical disk).\n\n*Click the Partition button in the toolbar and resize accordingly. You may want to allocate about 80GB to Windows or more depending on how much you intend to use it.\n\n*Click Apply and reboot. You should be able to boot into your Windows partition now.\n\nA: I think you should check your filled hard disk space using following third party application.

I am looking for an SFTP or rsync (?) tool (or script?) that watches a certain folder or certain files and uploads them to a remote server securely on change.\nThe background:\nI've been using Sublime SFTP for that, it works quite well, but sometimes \"forgets\" its watching duties. Also, I'm giving Atom a go as an alternative editor and there are no tools that live up 100% to Sublime SFTP.\nMost editor-based SFTP tools just upload files upon save, but that doesn't cover files built buy gulp or CodeKit.\nWe've been adding gulp-sftp to our build scripts, but that also has drawbacks.\nSo what I've been wondering: isn't there a standalone application that simply can watch files or folders for changes and upload them via SFTP, rsync or scp? \n\nA: Try cron. It's a tool that runs commands at a specific time or interval. It may not be exactly what you're looking for (clone on build) but it works quite well.\nTo set up cron: from Terminal, type crontab -e.\nThis should bring up a text editor (depending on which text editor you set as default) and a nice header explaining what each field does.\nminute, hour: does as it says\ndom: day of month\nmon: month\ndow: day of week\n\nNow, we'll take a look at your command to do regular backups. A great tool for backups is rsync. You'll need to set up SSH keys for it to work without a password prompt.\nHere's the command I use:\nrsync -vzhaPE --delete-after /path/to/local/file ip.address.of.server:/path/to/backup/location\n\nOptions used: -vzhaPE\nv: verbose\nz: compress (good for slow connections. Adjust compression level with --compress-level=<1-9>)\nh: human readable numbers\na: archive mode. This preserves timestamps and practically clones everything over as it were.\nP: progress bar.\nE: keep partial files. This means that if the connection was interrupted, rsync will pick up on the partial files and continue where it left off. Good for copying multiple large files over a slow network.\ndelete-after: deletes files from the server that have been deleting from the sending side\n\nOptions v, h and P are more for human debugging, so we won't introduce them into our cron job.\nSo, to put it together in cron:\n(run every ten minutes, for example)\n*/10 * * * * rsync -zaE --delete-after /path/to/local/file ip.address.of.server:/path/to/backup/location\n\nThis command will back whatever files in are the directory specified to the server's specified directory every ten minutes. No duplicates will be made as rsync will delete the files it copies over.\nAdditionally, if you'd like, you can also run a script that moves the copied backup over to another folder if you're interested in a Time Machine-like versioning functionality. You'll need enough storage space though, and some minor tweaks to the backup command (rsync push to rsync pull). If this is what you're looking for, let me know and I'll expand on it.\n\nA: I found https://github.com/DmitryKoterov/dklab_realsync/tree/master - the setup is easy (with a config file for each site and a wizard to create it) it's cross-platform, supports password-less login - great!\nJust take care when defining what's to be synced or not if your local instance is not 100% the same as the one on the server – realysnc will make them the same! \n\nA: https://atom.io/packages/remote-sync has a reliable watcher and is less \"risky\" to use than remote_sync from my other answer. Fine for syncing .css and .js files only. \nDoesn't work completely password-less though, I use it with FTPS instead of SFTP\n", "Q: MBP retina 2015 with usb 3 to ethernet and active wifi sharing fails at iMessage So here's the thing. My iMessage on the MBP is simply not working, when I use my MBP the way I want to. What way is that? Since it has no Ethernet connector, I bought a USB 3 to Ethernet box, that does its job nicely. iMessage does work with it. I have no WiFi in my office, so to keep costly traffic away from my iPhone I setup the MVP to share its internet connection via WiFi. From this moment on, iMessage will no longer work. And I know why, but I don't know how to fix it. Reason for the why is that iMessage (as opposed to every single other application on my MBP) explicitly takes en0 as the networking device to send and receive data. But en0 is the local WiFi, my Ethernet device is en3. The local WiFi is just a bridge for my iPhone, not \"the internet\". But iMessage is to dumb to get that. It is smart enough to know not to use en0 when WiFi is turned off or not connected though, and then will use en3 readily. So the question is: \nHow can I convince iMessage to always use en3?\n\nA: Open System Preferences > Network, click the tiny gear at the bottom of your services panel next to the + and - buttons, and select \"Set Service Order\". Drag your ethernet service (en3) to the top (or at least above en0/Wi-Fi) to send all outgoing network traffic through en3.\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4s not connecting to the Internet using the sim and heating up in standby I purchased an iPhone 4s on eBay.

I had the same issue, couldn't get rid of soundflower, and started thinking of what apps I had that dealt with audio. I remembered I had Adobe Audition, and uninstalled it. It worked! No more soundflower!    Hoppe this helps\n", "Q: Why did an \"Untitled\" partition appear that uses up half the disc space and how do I get rid of it? On a Mac OS X Server, I realized today that the 1TB disk has all of the sudden two partitions, both of them around 500GB large:\n1TB APPLE HDD ST1000LM024\n  Macintosh HD2:\n    Mount Point: /\n    Format: Mac OS Extended (journaled)\n    Capacity: 499.41 GB\n  Untitled:\n    Mount Point: /Volumes/Untitled\n    Format: Mac OS Extenden (journaled)\n    Capacity: 499.28 GB\n\nWhen I look in /Volumes/Untitled, I see the following data:\n.DS_Store\n.Spotlight-V100\n.Trashes\n.fseventsd\n\nAnd that is it.\nSo maybe I'm becoming crazy but I am almost certain that this partition has not been there before. Was it created by the OS? Is it important? Can I just delete it, so that my other partition can use the full 1TB space?\n\nA: You only have bookkeeping files on that partition. Unless there are hidden files, you can delete it and expand the / partition to get all the space to use.\nsudo ls -laOR /Volumes/Untitled\n\nAs to why, that might be hard to guess unless someone was contemplating Bootcamp or making a RAID and needed to reduce the size to match the other disk.\nTo delete it, Disk Utility is the easiest method to resize the main partition once you've deleted the Untitled one. Just read the dialog carefully on which partition's data will be erased and which will remain before pressing OK in the dialogs.\nYou can learn more here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to resize Macintosh HD?\nThe command you might need to do that from the command line without prompts asking if it's OK (so be sure to back everything up on the mac first) would be:\ndiskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ \"Macintosh HD2\" disk222s2 disk222s3\n\nI made the command use disk222s2 to avoid it working on all reasonable setups. If your second drive was disk2 that held the splits, you would substitute disk2s2 disk2s3 after checking the s2 and s3 parts matched the volumes to merge.\n", "Q: generate password option not appearing in \"manage apple id\" I am trying to generate an app specific password, as I can not get Thunderbird on Ubuntu, to connect to the icloud server. I found a few posts on the web that infer, you now  have to generate an app specific password, using the manage your apple id site. the instructions at the apple site say to log into your account\nand click on the edit button in the security section, and then to click on \"generate password\". When I do this, no option appears to \"generate password\"\nSteps outlined by Apple:\nSign in to your Apple ID account page.\nIn the Security section, click Edit.\nClick Generate Password and follow the steps on your screen.\n\n\nA: It appears that app specific passwords are not needed to access icloud on Ubuntu, using Thunderbird. I refired up an old box, I had stashed away; and, it connected to icloud fine, on Ubuntu using Thunderbird. I set up this account nearly 2 years ago and it works, with no app specific password. However, I never was able to set an app specific password at the apple site. So, I am closing this as, I don't actually need one.\n\nA: That's a bummer - many of Apple's iCloud web apps work well across PC and UNIX browsers - but you might need to reach out to Apple support to get a list of supported browsers or at least alert them to a bug in their code.\nI would double check that you have two-step verification enabled for the Apple ID in question and then try either Safari or Mobile Safari to browse to the site. Non two-step accounts can't create app-specific passwords in the current design of the service.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage\nI've verified that both Safari on OS X and iOS 9 work fine with the generate password link.

Will an Apple Airport Express be able to do what I need?\nI work on a laptop running Win7Pro, and my internet feed comes to a Netgear DM111P cabled modem, which I connect to the laptop using an ethernet cable. The modem sits in my office at home, and I'm fine with this set-up when I'm working in that room. But I want to be able to connect wirelessly to the internet sometimes from other rooms in the house (max distance say 10 metres through 2 doors), using a wifi access point device (WAPD) that I leave in the office. So the idea is that I leave one end of the ethernet cable plugged into the modem, and I move the other end between the laptop (when I'm in the office) and the WAPD (when I want to use internet elsewhere). The procedure needs to be quick and simple. I don't want to have to configure software all the time. I just want to be able (when leaving the office) to power up the WAPD, take the ethernet cable out of the laptop and plug it into the WAPD, then leave the room with the laptop; and (when coming back into the office) turn the WAPD off, take the ethernet cable out of the WAPD and plug it back into the laptop. Also I want to turn the modem off when I'm not on the internet.\nIs the Airport Express a WAPD of this kind?\n\nA: The unit should do what you want. No guarantee on the bandwidth as the range increases, but if your Internet connection is less than 30Mbps, and you're only using it for Internet access, then having the wireless component shouldn't slow you down.\n", "Q: In GarageBand iOS, does the \"Optimizing Performance\" operation induce an irreversible degradation of recorded signals? I have GarageBand on both my iPad Air and iPhone 6 (iOS 9.2.1, GarageBand 2.1). I have experienced this problem on both platforms.\nI have put many hours recording guitar and bass on relatively small projects (max 10 tracks, about 1 minute). I experienced the \"Optimizing Performance\" message some times, that lasts for about 5-10 seconds. When I saw this, I thought it was okay; it was caching and/or preprocessing stuff to accelerate 'live' playback. I would accept that. \nHowever, I noticed that the playback sound quality degraded after this. By degradation, I mean the following. I record many high-pitched rock guitar parts with enough gain to have a 'rock' distortion, so the signals have a fair amount of high frequencies. After the \"Optimizing Performance\" degradation, the high frequencies distorted to be painful to the ears. I am not an expert, but my guess is that the \"Optimizing Performance\" is in fact a 'downsampling' or a 'compression' of the signals.\nAgain, I would accept that, if it was only for the 'live playback'; when exporting the project to a sound file (*.m4a), I would expect GarageBand to take the original full bandwidth good quality signals that I recorded in the first place. However, it does not; the resulting exported songs' quality is still bad.\nSo, my conclusion (that I turned into a question to this community for a confirmation) is that this \"Optimizing Performance\" is a downsampling/compression of the signals in an 'irreversible' way, which is a pretty way to say that it is ruining everything (by everything, I mean a lot of time and efforts). Again (I am a good guy), that would be okay, but if at least I could be warned that this might soon happen, so that I can clean up my project to release memory. For now it just explodes in my face and I cry.\nAnyone else experienced a degradation from the \"Optimizing Performance\"? Is it really an irreversible downsampling/compression of the signals? Is there a way to block or at least revert this to get back the original signals when it happens? \nI have to say that I did not test the 'undo' option; each time it happened, I freaked out and closed/opened back GarageBand (it clears any possible undo). This was panic acting. But still, I would like to hear anyone's experience on this.\n\nA: Apple is pretty mum on what \"Optimizing performance\" means, so we only have speculation to go by, but I have noticed a few things and have an idea for you. I have noticed that turning off all reverb and delay effects causes it to happen much less frequently. This would indicate it's some sort of preprocessing or pre-generation to save CPU cycles on playback. The fact that I currently have a 40-minute piece in iOS GarageBand that is taking up 6GB on disk, even though the piece is almost entirely midi tracks and contains no live instrument or vocal tracks, would corroborate that it is storing audio tracks. This is also corroborated by the fact that if I change the tempo, it reliably immediately does an \"Optimizing Performance\" the very next time I try to play it.\nRemember, GarageBand is much more processor-intensive than ordinary audio, because instead of just a left and right channel, it has individual left-and-right channels for every track, which must individually be panned, processed with reverb/delay, etc. So it's entirely possible that it's generating much lower-bandwidth lossy-compression versions of your audio for playback within Mobile GarageBand just to reduce processor load while multiple tracks are playing.\nHowever, based solely on long experience, I would conjecture that it does not reduce the quality of your original audio, but rather, generates a second \"optimized\" file for use just within the program during playback. I bet if you were to export the entire project to an audio file, your original guitar sound wound be there in sparkling full fidelity. \nIf you wanted to test this out and report the results back here, I bet you'd be doing a service to the community and the odd Googler who finds this while hunting down the same question.\nObviously, if I'm right about that, it would mean iOS GarageBand is not an ideal app to do final mixes on, since you can't actually hear what it will really sound like until you export the results. Hmmm... An Apple app that includes a fundamental shortcoming which makes it a less-than-ideal tool for a serious user who wants it to do what they're advertising it for... Could that even be possible? Hmmmm.\n\nA: Double click on the blank space and choose \"select all\" by. With all regions of all tracks selected, double click any track and click \"settings\", then \"reset all\". I thought I had lost hours of work but this cleared up the distortion for me. \nNote: Keep in mind this will remove all quantization, looping, and quantization.\n\nA: I may have a workaround to get to export the song without the degradated signals caused by the \"Optimizing Performance\" process, but it implies having 2 iOS devices. \nOn iOS device #1, record, mix and have fun. If the \"Optimizing Performance\" happens, leading to a degradation of signals, let it be, even if frustrating. When ready to export the song, on iOs device #1, exit the song and let it update to iCloud. At this point, in my experience, if you export the song via iOS device #1, it will contain the degradated signals.\nOn iOS device #2, open GarageBand and wait until the song is updated via iCloud. Do not open the song, otherwise the \"Optimizing Performance\" process may happen and you will have degradated signals on iOS device #2 as well. Without opening it, export the song. It will have a good quality.\nSo, this at least answers one aspect of the original question: the “Optimizing Performance” operation does NOT induce an irreversible degradation of recorded signals. \nHowever, the question to how to easily get back the original signals to export the song in good quality within a single instance of GarageBand is still open.\n\nA: That happens to me, but then I just move the bass knob on the track settings and fix for that track.\n\nA: Yeah under plug ins and eq moving the treble and bass back and forth a bit does bring back the same quality. Make sure optimise performance doesn't reformat anything before moving your track off garage band for Download or upload.\n\nA: I am a producer and rapper and I have had the exact same problem. I have one solution: \nConstantly make copies  of your song until it is finished. Everything you change in your song, make sure you make a copy of the song so you don’t lose your work. \nWhen it randomly  says optimizing performance and it ruins your whole song, press select all and copy your whole song. Close your song and open one of the other songs you saved as a copy. Delete the whole song and paste the first one you copied. After that there should be no distortion.  \nOr you can just keep making copies all the way through so if you have that problem just click another song that is copied and will be the exact same. \nIt’s a pain though because every time it says optimizing performance you have to do it. I always make sure I have 3 copies of my completed song in case that stupid glitch happens. \nI am currently producing my best instrumental and this problem keeps happening, that is why I wrote this answer to help.\n", "Q: Recovering a Password on FileVault2 Encrypted Mac I changed my admin (login) password on my Macbook Air and subsequently forgot it.

Since I really like the functionality to maximize a windows by just pushing it to the top of the screen, I would like to have that on my Macbook too.\nI am using Spectacle to assign shortcuts like \"windows\" to maximize a window, which works well and I recommend it.\nHowever, is there any application to maximize a window like the way you can do it on a Windows laptop/pc, just by pushing the window to the top of the screen?\nNote: I mean maximize window, not fullscreen.\n\nA: Hold shift option ⌥ and click the green maximise button on the top left part of the window.\n\nNOTE: not every OSX application is eligible for maximize (example: maximizing the Finder doesn't work)\n\nA: I just had the same issue and found that Rectangle is a perfect free and open source solution: https://rectangleapp.com/\n\nA: There is an app called Cinch that mimics the Windows behavior you've described.  You can run it in demo mode, indefinitely, to see it does what you want before purchasing it. \n\nCinch gives you simple, mouse-driven window management by defining the\n  left, right, and top edges of your screen as 'hot zones'. Drag a\n  window until the mouse cursor enters one of these zones then drop the\n  window to have it cinch into place. Cinching to the left or right\n  edges of the screen will resize the window to fill exactly half the\n  screen, allowing you to easily compare two windows side-by-side\n  (splitscreen). Cinching to the top edge of the screen will resize the\n  window to fill the entire screen (fullscreen). Dragging a window away\n  from its cinched position will restore the window to its original\n  size.\n\n\nA: ⌥ Option and double-click a window's corner, when the resize pointer appears.\nThanks to Kubuntuer82 and their answer for giving me the idea of trying out their technique while holding ⌥ Option. It worked for me on macOS Catelina :D\n\nA: There is a simple, but annoying standard way: hold alt/opt when clicking the green button on the top bar. It will change into a plus instead of the double arrow, and after clicking your window will be maximized.\n\nA: If you are still looking for an alternative way, have a look at Spectacle.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can select from the menu or use a keyboard shortcut. \n\n*There are many resize options but your requirement is \"Fullscreen ⌥⌘F\" \n\n*It is not like OS X full screen but Windows like maximum.\n\n\n\n\nA: A workaround without any 3rd-party software:\nIf you double click on any window corner (when the resize pointer appears) while holding the ⌥ (option) key, this will maximize the window.\nAlternatively, you can also double click on the window corner (when the resize pointer appears) to automatically expand that corner to maximum size. Therefore, if you double click on the top-left corner and then on the bottom-right corner, the window will expand completely, that is it gets maximized.\nUpdate: I have recently realized that for many apps, in my experience around 60%/70% of them, you can also just double click on the title bar and the window gets maximized as well. For the apps where this does not work (e.g. iTunes or some apps which have no title bar) you can still double click on opposite window corners as explained above.\n\nA: There's a BetterTouchTool app which does exactly what You need. You can download a trial and check it.\n\nThere's also Better Snap Tool from the same developer on the MacAppStore which does only window snapping.\n\nA: On El Captan, and maybe earlier, you can double click the top bar to make the window larger. It's similar to the Windows double click but some apps don't fill the whole screen. Not exactly click and drag like you were asking, but this way you don't need to install any third party apps.\n\nA: I use SizeUp for window management in OS X. I've used it for about 4 years now. SizeUp allows you to use keyboard shortcuts to move windows to different quadrants or halves of the screen. There is also a shortcut for maximizing the window. I used to miss the Windows gestures for window management, but once I got used to the keyboard shortcuts, I came to prefer OS X + SizeUp over the \"drag to the top to maximize\" gesture from Windows 7.\nhttp://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/\n\nA: Option-click the green traffic light button on the title bar\n\nA: I'd also like to suggest you Moom: https://manytricks.com/moom/\n\nA: You can do that using Split Screen Ultimate. \nWhen you press Control key and move the window to the top section of the screen, it will maximize the window - the way you want. \n\n\nDisclosure: I own this app.\n", "Q: Ctrl + → to have the same effect as ⌥ + → How can I make Ctrl + Arrow to have the same effect as ⌥ + Arrow, i.e. move to the previous/next word? \n\nA: Karabiner has this functionality:\n\n", "Q: Adding photos to iPhone programmatically without iTunes I'd like to know how to add photos to an iOS device without iTunes nor any \"iPhone explorer\" programs.\nI have the image files, and I have the iPhone \"mounted\" on a Linux machine, which means I have access to some directories like DCIM and PhotoData.\nNow, how do I actually put the pictures in ? I tried dropping them in DCIM but of course it doesn't work and despite the files being there they don't show up in the camera roll. Is there any particular thing to do after copying the files, or a particular file name syntax to follow?\n\nA: Apple expects you to use iCloud Photo Library. With that service you can login to the iCloud website on the Linux machine, click on Photos and then click on the \"Upload\" link to select images to upload. Your phone doesn't have to be connected to the Linux machine, just to the Internet via WiFi, and it will sync the new photos. I've done this myself and it does seem to work (not from a Linux machine, but with the Chrome browser).\nThe alternative would be to buy the camera connection kit or lightning to sd card adaptor and setup an sd card exactly the way it would look if it came from a camera, copying the images from the Linux machine. Note, I  haven't tried this but it should work as long as the directories on the sd card match how they would be constructed if they were created by a camera.\n", "Q: Moving country. I have recently moved country and want to change my billing info over as a result. \nBefore I left I took out a subscription to iTunes Match, and did not bring my laptop with me as it was wiped and sold so my music is not physically stored on any machine.  \nIs there any way I can change over the country on my account without losing all the music I have in the cloud storage as it is asking me to cancel my subscription before this can be done?\n\nA: Do you need to change the country before downloading all music?\nIf not, just connect to your account, download your music, copy it out of the default folder (to make sure). Then update your account details, and if needed re-upload all your music.\n\nA: When I moved abroad I asked Apple whether I must change my Apple ID location to that other country.  From what I understand from their reply, it is not necessary nor mandatory.  \nHowever if I were to change the location it would indeed imply some serious changes.  Now 3 years later, I've been using my US Apple ID abroad without any issue. \nThis was Apple's reply:\n\nThis is xxxxx from iTunes Store Support and I'll be glad to be your\n  Advisor for today.

Is there an advantage to delete apps from Launchpad (Hold one app like in iOS) vs from finder?\n\nAnd why some apps cannot be deleted from Launchpad?\n\nA: Deleting apps from Launchpad and Applications folder are similar but for an extra step. When you delete from Launchpad, MacOS removes it completely from  your system.\nFrom Finder(Applications folder), you move it to Trash and have to empty the trash to completely delete the app and generate space out of it.\nThose apps which cannot be deleted from LaunchPad (without X) are apps pre-installed by the OS and needed by it or apps that you have installed separately using a DMG file from third party like Google/ Mozilla FF.\nRest apps which can be deleted are apps installed from AppStore.\n", "Q: Can a Standard User format an encrypted drive?

However the erase function is available (the button is there, and I can click it) and I don't want to actually start erasing my system inadvertently.\n\nA: You're right- while booted from the other partition you don't need admin access to erase a disk.\nYou can set a firmware password to prevent someone from changing the startup disk if you're worried about that. But keep in mind they could just physically remove the disk from the computer.

You can either take it into an Apple Store and have them reinstall or have someone you know has a Mac download OS X and create a bootable USB for you.  See the answer here - different question, but the answer is still the same:  reinstall OS X from scratch via boot media.  \n", "Q: Is there an iOS app for quick switching of the wifi network? On my iPad, I frequently need to switch between two wifi networks due to different access rights on those networks. It's quite cumbersome having to navigate to the Settings App, find the network settings page, and switch networks there. I'm looking for an app that helps me speed up the network switching, by either:\n\n\n*\n\n*offering a list of available networks, ideally as a notification center widget, and allows me to select a network there; or\n\n*offers a quick link to opening the relevant page in the Settings App.\n\n\nA: No, iOS applications do not have access to Wi-Fi settings and basically all other settings.\n\nA: You can actually access WIFI directly via the Notification Center / widgets such as Launcher from Cromulent Labs or Magic Launcher widget. They offer the option to open up WIFI from the widget without going to the Settings app first. This has been working from iOS8 untill iOS10. Unfortunately you can't however switch within the widget itself between WIFI access points it's only a quick link that bring you to the WIFI area of the Settings app. \nOfcourse you can also access cellular data this way or switch between bluetooth devices quickly via such a widget.  \n\nA: No to toggling two preset networks. Siri can toggle WiFi and Apple provides fast access via the control center.\n\n*\n\n*Swipe down from off screen top right corner\n\n*Tap and hold WiFi\n\n*Tap and hold WiFi\n\n*Choose a (new) SSID\n\n\n", "Q: Authenticate with phone instead of password I understand that what I want is really strange.\nWe have something like shared build server (mac mini, yosemite), which is located in public place in office; basically everybody have physical access to it.\nWe have special user account created for our project needs, and all necessary tools / passwords etc are configured under this user account.\nWe have a rather big group of people, who should have physical access to this user account from time to time.\nAs a (predicted) result we have simple \"password\" which is known to everybody, even to people outside of this group.\nIs there any way / third-party tool to use phone applications like Google Authenticator, which will allow access to this specific user account to a predefined group of people, without relying on just password?\nIn general I'm looking for any solution which might solve my problem - login to account with \"public password\" to specific people only.\n\nA: I'm not aware of other 2FA softwares to unlock a Mac, however I've recently found this software that might be of use to you: http://www.knocktounlock.com/. It uses an iPhone to unlock a Mac. Otherwise, you could consider using an unused USB flash drive to serve as a key (for example Rohos Logon Key http://www.rohos.com/products/rohos-logon-free/).\n\nA: There are dozens of 2FA pam plugins as well as automation tools to allow one user account to be tied to one iOS device or one iCloud account.\nWhere you will run into issues is having an N-to-one relation between one user account and multiple people's mobile phones. Without some sort of SMS group pool or server side setup, I don't think you'll find a pre-made solution.\nI've used http://macid.co/get/ and it's more of a novelty than something I would trust in production. Here are two much better engineered solutions to modify the OS X authentication chain for two factor:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Yubico_YubiKeyMacOSXLogin_en.pdf\n\n*https://www.saaspass.com/platforms/mac-osx-two-factor-authentication-one-time-password.html\nThere are dozens of other companies and this uses the same hooks that smart card readers do to make OS X enforce additional code execution before a user can log in with the password. Yubico documents the /etc/pam.d/authorization file you would change and also walks you through how you would modify the system (SIP prevents this change on recent OS releases) to run the code needed to validate or deny the login event.\n\nNone of these will be less work than changing the password and setting up a way to distribute that password to only the mobile devices for the users allowed to know the new password. Make that system flexible and you can change the password daily or just when needed.\n", "Q: Problem registering gmail in iPad I recently changed the password for my gmail account. I was able to register the account on my iPhone but when I do the same on my iPad it tells me that the user id and password are incorrect. I changed the password again but the problem persisted. When I access gmail via Safari or Chrome there is no problem.\n\nA: Reset the settings on your iPad and then set up everything from scratch. Use the instructions from Apple Support article below. There's no need to change a password to use gmail account on iPad.\nAdd an email account to your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\n", "Q: RAID 0 setup does not contain full disk space from slices I just setup a striped RAID 0 on my 2012 MacBook Pro with two SSDs.  One drive is 256 GB and the other is 500 GB, but my RAID disk is only 510 GB.  Disk2 is my RAID disk, with disk0 and disk1 being slices.\nDoes anyone know what's going on and how to fix this?  \nI erased all disks prior to setting this up.  See attached image from diskutil list output.\nI used the OS X Yosemite Disk Utility to setup the RAID and now I am running El Capitan.\n\n\nA: You can't fix this. The size of a RAID is always a multiple of the smallest volume used in the setup.\nThe chunk sizes (stripe sizes, interlace sizes) as well as the number of chunks have to be equal on all used volumes. Usually the chunk size is 64 kb. These requirements are determined by the size of the smallest disk and limit the size of the resulting RAID volume.\n\nA: For your purposes, RAID 0 is not going to really get you faster or larger, and is not going to accomplish your goal (which I\"m assuming is a blazing fast Mac with a large HDD, as that's why most folks do it)..\n\n\n*\n\n*RAID 0 (on disk utility) is software RAID. in other words it requires the system to maintain. and that's never really good. nor is it fast.\n\n*RAID 0 software is going to use the smallest size HDD as the basis for every raid build.. so it has assumed that ALL your drives are 256gb, because the smallest is 256.. therefore 256 + 256 = 512.... the remaining data space on your 512gb drive is utterly useless.\n\n*Your MBP has a 6gb data bus. use it. get a faster drive and you'll be happier. if you can swing it, Samsung EVO 1tb or 2tb - quite snappy performance....\n\n*you can still target the 2nd drive within the OS, and data-share across them... For instance, you could put the 256 in the main bay, run the OS and your Apps on it, and have all your users and user data on the 512 drive.\nThis is often better, because you've reduced reads/writes for each drive, so the system is more efficient.\n", "Q: Protect files from other administrator accounts So at work there is a \"shared\" server that people can run things on that take a long time. I make quite a bit of use of this machine to the point where I made my own login to separate my user files.\n\n\n*\n\n*The account I am using is an administrator. \n\n*The other account that everyone else uses is also an administrator.\n\n\nIn my user files is some private SSH keys for things like Github and Amazon Web Services that the other users could do mean things with if they were so inclined. I don't think they would, but it would be nice to not have to think about it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way I can add some protection to these files without changing the permission level of the other login?\n\n*Is it possible for other administrators to access the saved keychain credentials of another administrator?\n\n*If you were to \"do it right\", how would you recommend setting up this machine such that it could be reasonably shared by people who need to perform administrative tasks, but not be a security nightmare.\n\nA: Simple answer - no. Administrative access is too powerful for multiple users on a single machine. Even if you trust every one of these users implicitly, there will always be a chance of accidental misuse and potential data loss.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are admin - you can read any file on the Mac\n\n*If you are admin - you can delete and modify any file on the Mac\n\n\nThe only exception is SIP - where even root can't modify some files Apple has marked as restricted.\nStandard operating procedure dictates standard user accounts for all users on a multi-user Mac, with an administrator's account for maintenance, etc.\nYou can make an encrypted DMG to store things that you can't allow another user of the computer to see. They could copy the files and try to brute force the password - but Finder does a good job of asking for and mounting such filesystems when you reference an alias to the file.\nThe keychain is a specialized version of an encrypted store. You might be able to store your keys there and they would be safe from other users in a similar manner.\n", "Q: 4623:011a multitouch monitor At work we have a multitouch monitor which apparently is a USB Human Interface Device (HID).

combination of both a keyboard (with PgUp and PgDn accessible via remote control) and a multi-touch input device. The keyboard aspect works well enough: OS X reports the keyboard as unknown type, asking to press a specific shift key. Since I don't have shift, I press either of those page movement buttons and then can manually select a keyboard type. After that, I can use the keys to scroll in applications.\nThe touch input, however, seems to be non-functional. The device is reported as IOHIDPointing and Digitizer in the above report, so there appears to be some understanding about what kind of device that is. Nevertheless I don't see it controlling my mouse pointer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I have to enable this device somehow, to say that the multi-touch events from that source should control my mouse pointer?\n\n*Do I have to load any additional drivers, to make HID multi-touch events end up controlling my pointer?\n\n*Is there some tool (command line or graphical, shipped with OS X or third party) which I can use to debug which events the device generates? Preferably at different levels, like HID, touch, pointer or whatever the actual architecture is?\n\n\n\nEdit: I opened Apple bug report 25216130 about this.\n\nA: There is a bug in the Apple USB stack, which prevents some USB Composite Devices to work.\nI opened a Apple TSI and a bug report about this, and I was given a workaround, that fixes it for me.\nThe workaround is simply a codeless kext, with this personality added to the dictionary of IOKitPersonalities:\n    <key>Display Workaround</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>\n        <string>com.apple.driver.AppleUSBHostMergeProperties</string>\n        <key>IOClass</key>\n        <string>AppleUSBHostMergeProperties</string>\n        <key>IOProviderClass</key>\n        <string>IOUSBHostDevice</string>\n        <key>IOProviderMergeProperties</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>kUSBRemoteWakeOverride</key>\n            <false/>\n        </dict>\n        <key>idVendor</key>\n        <integer>17955</integer>\n        <key>idProduct</key>\n        <integer>282</integer>\n    </dict>\n\n(I added your VID/PID above).\nA future OS X version will (hopefully) fix this.\nPlease note that the codeless kext must be placed on /Library/Extensions, and that must be signed.\n", "Q: Blue and white rectangle I just restarted my MacBook Pro and I am now getting a blue and white rectangle near the top right corner of my screen. Does anyone know what this is or what is causing it?\nMacBook Pro Retina 15-inch, Late 2013, Version 10.11.3.\n\nAfter restarting my laptop again, the box was not there immediately, but showed up before everything was fully loaded in a slightly different location.\nI am unable to click on the box, and trying to drag it just creates the regular selection box as if nothing is there.\nUpdate: I ran Apple's diagnostics and it claimed there is nothing wrong with the machine itself.\nUpdate 2: I attempted to restart my machine into safe mode a couple times but it did not seem to work. It looked like a normal load sequence, just hanging before asking for my login credentials. However, after a regular login, I no longer seem to have this issue. Hopefully it stays this way.\n\nA: Here's a list of steps to possibly resolve your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset Finder: This is a basic step, just open up Force Quit Applications by calling ⌘-⌥-esc and then press finder and reset it.\n\n*Open Terminal and enter the command killall Finder. If it goes away then it's a problem with finder. \n\n*Open Activity Monitor: If there is anything irregular open in activity monitor just close it. However, be very careful with Activity Monitor. It's easy to close something that will crash your machine. \n\n", "Q: Install Mac OS X via network across different subnets We have more than 70 subnets and lots of switches. I want to install Mac OS X to client computers. By the way the computer may have an operating system installed or not. I want to put an Apple Server in one place and all clients install Mac OS X from there. In the local network everything is fine but in a different subnet net install does not work. I searched some techniques but I think they are not for us. \nFor example my Mac OS server's IP is 10.10.4.40  and the destination computer's IP is 10.10.12.23  \nAlso our switches' configs are fine for netboot/netinstall (portfast and etc.)\nBut our technicians says \"Computer cannot see the OS X Server\". \nI also read bootpd, Apple shell script solution vs. but the main problem is destination computer may not have operating system.\nPlease give me easy way to do it.\n\nA: I'm late to this party but @klanomath's comments are correct- you probably need to open the network ports. If you can see the images on the local network but not the remote network then it's likely the traffic isn't making it through.\nWatch the server's system.log file for messages like this from bootpd:\nBSDP INFORM [en0] 1,0:1b:63:39:d0:9f NetBoot024 arch=i386 sysid=iMac5,2\n\nOr get a packet trace from the server:\nsudo tcpdump -i en0 -s 0 -B 524288 -w ~/Desktop/NetBoot.pcap\n\nI usually open them in Wireshark and filter for \"bootp or tftp\" to see how far things get. If there isn't any bootp traffic from that client then something on the network is probably blocking it.\n", "Q: Setting Terminal tab names in OS X and using vim I regularly ssh into a Linux cluster from an OS X (El Capitan) Terminal, sometimes with multiple Terminal tabs. I use bash and vim.\nI'd like to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*while ssh'd, set the Terminal tab title to the current working directory using PROMPT_COMMAND='printf \"\\e]1;\"`basename $PWD`\"\\a\"'\n\n*while using vim, set the Terminal tab title to \"vim — FILENAME\"\n\n\nHere are my problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I do let &titlestring = \"vim — \" . expand(\"%:t\") and set title in .vimrc, it changes the Terminal window title, not the tab title. If I do not separately set the tab title (parameter 1), the tab title mirrors the window title (parameter 2), but as soon as I set the tab title, it \"decouples\" from the window title.\n\n*If I run an external command in .vimrc with :!, I get a \"Press ENTER\" dialog that's annoying.\n\n*If I use :silent ! in .vimrc, my Terminal prompt ends up at the bottom of the screen after exiting vim. I really don't want to muck around with saving the prompt position and resetting it every time I want to use vim.\n\n*If I define in my .bashrc the following function:\nfunction vim\n{\n    printf \"\\e]1;\"`basename \"$1\"`\"\\a\"\n    vim \"$1\"\n}\n\nthen my terminal crashes upon calling vim from the command line. Calling the function vvim instead works, but I don't want to type vvim forever. I want to alias vim.\nSo I seem stuck. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\nA: Well, I've solved my own problem. I fail programming 101.\nBy defining vim as a function and then calling vim, I set up an infinite recursive loop. No wonder my terminal crashed. I need to call the \"real\" vim, the actual executable.

As one of the El Cap features, Apple touts:\n\nFind your cursor\nRapidly shake your finger on the surface of your trackpad to increase the size of the pointer so it’s easy to spot. You can also shake your mouse to enlarge the pointer.\n\nI find that I place my right hand to the right of the trackpad and use my index finger and when I try to perform a \"shake\" there is a much larger vertical component to the action. I thought this new feature wasn't even turned on because my shake never made the cursor grow in size.\nHowever, I adjusted my hand position and made the shake much more horizontal and I see the special effect. The problem is this is an unnatural position for me to use the trackpad.\nIs there a way to toggle how much horizontal or vertical components are required for a shake to trigger the cursor size to grow?\n\nA: The only option is to disable this feature, found in System Preferences > Accessibility > Display. \n\nI translate \"back and forth\" as being horizontal movement only.

I want to keep the background of my terminal in RGB 484848 ... but it changes to white and then silver and then bluish after each restart\nI don't know what did i do. \n\nA: I suspect that you are using the profile named Solid Colors in Terminal.  Each time the terminal opens, it cycles to a random background within /Library/Desktop\\ Pictures/Solid\\ Colors/ folder.  If you press Command-i, the inspector will open and you can change the settings of your current window.\nTry clicking to \"Pro\" and then back to \"Solid Colors\" a few times.  You should get different a effect from Solid Colors nearly every time you come back to it.\nI believe that you will have to make a new settings profile with the background color you want and then set that profile as the default.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 was stolen My iPhone 6 was stolen.\nUsed find my iPhone app and put it into lost mode on my iPad.

I'm not talking about the end where the buttons are, but rather the other side. This device gets lost several times a day by children who hold on to it and misplace it on a regular basis. What I want to do is attach a hub cap to it like gas stations do with bathroom keys.\nIs there anything at the back end of these remotes? I just want to drill a 1/4\" hole.\n\nA: Have a look around the web for disassembly. From a quick look, it appears there is room to drill a hole below the battery for the silver remote. \nThe newer generation black remote is much more contained, but there is room in the bottom corners of the remote below the battery. \nI'd recommend disassembling and removing adjacent parts before drilling.\nUpdate: Very late reply but for the TV2 remote it should be an all-aluminum body below the battery. I drilled a 1/8\" hole through the bottom left.\n\n\nA: Any infrared remote can be used with Apple TV - so I might put the nice one in a drawer and get whatever large plastic remote you prefer and do the one time setup to map the existing buttons to the Apple TV functions.\nOn mono price, a 10 button remote is going for $1.50 and you can double the button count for another quarter or so.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=6166\n\n*http://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=6167\nAlso, even if you sort out where it's safe to drill - I would go with a very strong adhesive pad over drilling to put a long leash or whatnot on the Apple remote if you choose to go that way.\n\nA: It's also worth noting that you could use a product like Sugru or Polymorph to form a piece of plastic onto or around the remote with a piece of metal coat hanger wire embedded to create a loop for you to tie onto.\n\nA: I drilled a hole into the apple tv 1 remote and it worked fine. I drilled it at the bottom right corner then used a key ring attaching  the remote to a tile finder. But now the new one is all black and even harder  to see sometimes. I am sure there are many ways to figure this out but my idea seems most elegant.

I'm curious about (and was unable to find documentation for) any size limits for FileVault in OSX (10.9.5 Server). I'm concerned about any sort of corruption/instability that could occur after encrypting a 70-100tb logical disk.\nI've run into this as an issue with volumes larger than 70tb with TimeMachine and had to switch to a different product for my backups.\nIgnore the \"why are you doing this\" or \"why are you not using linux/bsd\". For a wide variety of reasons, I'm stuck with OSX for this project and am unable to split the partition into smaller segments.\nAny insight would be much appreciated!\n\nA: According to Apple the maximum volume size and file size (using Mac OS X v10.5.3 or later) of a volume formatted with the HFS+ file system is close to 8 EB (exactly 2^63 - 2^31 = 9,223,372,034,707,292,160 B). This is also valid for encrypted volumes.\n\nOne fact cannot be concealed: the monstrous Logical Volume (the FileVault2 \"envelope\") is highly vulnerable to drive failure. The failure probability is comparable to a RAID0. Since FileVault doesn't use evenly spread chunks you may recover more data after a drive loss.\nHere is a comparison for 10, 11 or 12 disks (8 TB):\nSurvival probability (for new 8 TB disks and being optimistic):\nNr of disks  1st year 2nd year 3rd year 4th year 5th year\n         10       84%      37%      15%       8%       5%\n         11       83%      33%      12%       7%       3%\n         12       82%      30%      10%       5%       2%\n\nIf the disks are smaller than 8 TB (and the number of disks is higher) the survival probability is even worse.\n", "Q: What hardware do I need to use a Kinect model 1414 with a Mac?

My question is how so I put the application in launchpad? \n\nA: Launchpad automatically grabs all applications in your root /Applications directory and in your /User/username/Applications directory. If you keep some of your apps in other locations, they won't appear in Launchpad automatically. \nTo add them to Launchpad, simply drag the app onto the Launchpad icon in the Dock.

Turn it off, and then try and send some messages to contacts you know have an iPhone to make sure it's worked properly. If you're presented with a sea of green, then all's good. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you've already made the switch and are still suffering\n\n\nGrab your phone and ring Apple support – check your local Apple website for the number in your part of the world.

It's formatted in FAT (for use with Mac & Win) and I can't seem to find a way to encrypt it as:\nFileVault doesn't encrypt FAT.\nTrueCrypt can be installed after modifying the installer but doesn't run under 10.11 for me (library file missing) and there seems to be no solution, since TrueCrypt is no longer supported.\nIs there any solution to encrypt the stick without resorting to using a different computer?\n\nA: You could look into VeraCrypt which is the open-source successor to TrueCrypt and exists for Windows, OS X, and Linux. It can also open existing  TrueCrypt containers. https://veracrypt.codeplex.com \nLike TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt can create an encrypted CONTAINER FILE which is like an DMG or ISO image file and can be copied, so it would fit on a FAT32-formatted USB drive as long as the file size remains below 4 GB, as FAT32 cannot contain individual files larger than that. For this a container file you can choose between FAT, exFAT, and OS X Extended as the internal format. For maximum compatibility between Windows and OS X, FAT is the right choice. ExFAT can take files larger than 4 GB and is supported by Windows XP, but it is not supported in OS X before 10.6.5 Snow Leopard. \nFinally, you can also use VeraCrypt to create an ENCRYPTED DRIVE VOLUME, so that the whole USB drive or a partition itself is encrypted. However, VeraCrypt doesn't encrypt existing files directly. First you create an empty  encrypted container file or drive volume, then you copy your files to it. \n", "Q: iTunes credit for child's account? My son has a child account under my iTunes and when I approve a purchase for him it gets charged to my credit card, even though I have an iTunes balance credit from gift cards.  Is there a way to circumvent this, because he added his Christmas iTunes gift card under my iTunes, but we can't seem to use it for his purchases.\n\nA: If you add any iTunes gift cards to his Apple ID (not yours) any purchases he makes (even via your approval) will first come off his balance, not yours. \nIf/when his balance runs out, then any purchases would be charged to your account balance. If you have no credit on your account, then it would get charged to your credit card (assuming you have entered one).\nPerhaps you buy him a new gift card (as payment for the one he added to your account) and add the new one to his account. That should solve the problem.\n\nA: That is not true.

Is there any way to see what is going on with the drive, if OS X is fixing it in the background, or what is going on?\n\nA: Looking at the total size of the disk I suppose you are hit by the 2.2 TB limit of MBR partition tables. \n\nSince block addresses and sizes are stored in the partition table of an MBR using 32 bits, the maximum size as well as the highest start address of a partition using drives that have 512-byte sectors (actual or emulated) cannot exceed 2 TiB−512 bytes (2,199,023,255,040 bytes or 4,294,967,295 (2^32−1) sectors × 512 (2^9) bytes per sector). Alleviating this capacity limitation was one of the prime motivations for the development of the GPT.\n\nSo repartition the disk with a GPT partition table.\n", "Q: Dropbox files are syncing but Finder is not displaying them I'm running Yosemite (and have been for a while) and suddenly new Dropbox files are not showing in Finder.  They are syncing properly, and I can see this in the Dropbox recently updated menu in the top bar, and also on Terminal if I cd to a folder and ls -l.  So they're there, they're just not showing up in Finder.\nI recently update my work computer (so the place where the new files usually come from) to El Capitan.  However, the Mac which the new files are not displaying on is unchanged.  I'm assuming this is a coincidence, but it's maybe worth mentioning.\n\nA: To make sure we are talking apples to apples when referring to dropbox.\nIn the OS the folder under public called \"Dropbox\" is not the same as the common \"Dropbox\" web sharing service.  The apple convention allows other users to drop files for you to access without granting other users access to other files in your user folder.  The apple \"dropbox\" is located in ~/public/dropbox/ \nOnce you retrieve a file from that folder you would place it in your own file system wherever you want to access it from normally.  \nIf you are using the \"Dropbox\" web sharing service you would need to install that program and set it up to sync with one of the folders in your home folder outside of the Public folder.  \nAssuming you are aware of everything I said above the Dropbox program will need to be updated and reconfigured for El-Capitan as new security elements were established to manage access to network resources from programs and services. \nI would suggest uninstalling DropBox from your computer (whatever version you have installed) and then installing the updated version configure to the folder you want to sync and reboot your computer.  The files should start syncing then.  If they don't check the console to see what is occurring to block the access.   \n", "Q: Keychain: Ask password before autofill Is it possible to have Keychain ask for the admin password before autofilling other passwords or credit card information?\nI am already using keychain quite a bit. But I'm also realizing that other people use my computer occasionally and in that case, I would like my passwords to be off limits. For many of us it's not just passwords, but also credit card information that are stored in Keychain. \nI am aware that with the menu bar icon, one can Lock all Keychains. My experience with that was, though, that it renders the computer practically unusable. Too many services need access to the keychain, like accountsd. And unless a password is typed in, the password prompt will stay on screen at all times.\n\nA: Not sure how to require password for keychain but here's how I handle sharing my computer:\nMy admin account is password protected and I have a \"Guest\" account setup that anyone can access without my intervention (just choose the account). It sets up a clean/empty environment every time. None of your data will be there and anything they create will not be stored.\n", "Q: iPhone: View Photo Location in Maps I though this would be so obvious that the answer should be simple.\nI have a photo taken somewhere. I select it in the Photos app, and select the Share icon. I would simply like the option to view the location of this photo in the Apple Map.\nI have installed ViewEXIF, which does the job, but does too much, and takes an extra step to get to the Maps App.\nIs there an extension which would do this job simply?\nThanks\n\nA: There is a map view built into iOS 9. Go to the photos tab and select the location at the top of the photos area! \n\nA: No, there is no iOS photos.app extension like this. I'd pay for one. \nThe method you are using (metadata display app) is the only way to do this. The Collections location display method doesn't work if you are working with images in the context of an album.\nThe Location feature in Google Photos.app is more capable but is likewise not readily available for a single selected image.\n", "Q: Mavericks or El Captain for old MacBook Pro (early'11) In case of performance for multithreaded applications, development (Java) and virtualization (Parallels 11), what's better - upgrading to 10.9 Mavericks or El Captain?

I saw the popup below. I really could not care less if I can connect to iCloud at the moment of a particular startup or not. I just don't want popups. Is there any way I can get rid of it, permanently? Hopefully not by disabling iCloud; I'm sure there was a reason I enabled it; likely to get rid of some other popup somewhere.\n\n\nA: Chris Haertel's answer to a different question also works here, as evidenced by an Apple Discussions thread:\n\nIn your user folder, go to ~/Library/Keychains/ (hold down the option key when clicking in the Go menu in Finder to show the Library folder).\nIn that folder, there are the regular keychains, plus some folders with monstrously long names like F2555809-AAC0-5CFA-BEF6-57BB56345BIUR or some such.\nI deleted those folders only.\n\nAfter restarting, you may need to log into iCloud again, but the persistent popup and \"An unknown error occurred\" messages should be gone for good.\n\nA: I've been dealing with this same problem for a few days now (pretty annoying). The last thing I tried was to un-check every iCloud service that was enabled, sign out of iCloud and then sign back in. So far it seems to be OK, I'll just try it a bit more to see if the message pops up again.\nTo do so, just go to your iCloud settings in the System Preferences. This will open a setting windows much like this one.\n\nOnce there you have to deselect every service enabled and then proceed to Sign Out\nYou may be asked to save a copy of your iCloud data such as Contacts, Calendars, Pictures, etc. You may uncheck the services you dont want to save a copy and then just click Continue or Keep if you have selected any of the data to keep.\nIf you want to re-connect with your iCloud user account (or a new one) you'll have to select Sign In and then just proceed as requested.\n", "Q: Enable Function Key Lock when using external keyboard/Disable when using internal keyboard on Mac Book Pro When I'm developing I almost always have an external Bluetooth keyboard connected to my Mac Book Pro, and prefer the function lock to be active so the F1-F12 keys work without having to press the fn key. But when using the internal keyboard, I tend to be doing more casual things and brightness/volume etc are more commonly used. \nCan I enable/disable the function lock depending on which keyboard I am using?\n\nA: To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.\nTo enable this you have to create a filter for the external keyboard and invert all function/consumer keys.\nPrerequisites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download, install and open Karabiner\n\n*Open in the menulet Karabiner -> Preferences\n\n*Open the tab Misc & Uninstall\n\n*Hit the button Launch EventViewer\n\n*Hit the tab Devices\n\n*Make a note of the vendor and product ID of the external keyboard\n\n*Close the EventViewer\n\n*Hit the button Open private.xml\n\n*Open the file private.xml with an appropriate editor\n\n*Enter the customized keycode and replace the vendor and product ID by IDs found above\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <devicevendordef>\n    <vendorname>Apple</vendorname>\n    <vendorid>0x05ac</vendorid>\n  </devicevendordef>\n  <deviceproductdef>\n    <productname>ExternalKeyboard</productname>\n    <productid>0x0256</productid>\n  </deviceproductdef>\n  <item>\n    <name>Function to Consumer for External Keyboard</name>\n    <identifier>private.function2consumerExtK</identifier>\n    <device_only>DeviceVendor::Apple, DeviceProduct::ExternalKeyboard</device_only>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, ConsumerKeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F2, ConsumerKeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP</autogen>\n    ...\n  </item>\n  <item>\n    <name>Consumer to Function for External Keyboard</name>\n    <identifier>private.consumer2functionExtK</identifier>\n    <device_only>DeviceVendor::Apple, DeviceProduct::ExternalKeyboard</device_only>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN, ModifierFlag::FN, KeyCode::F1</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP, ModifierFlag::FN, KeyCode::F2</autogen>\n    ...\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nReplace the ellipses by all other necessary consumer and function keys\n\n*Save the file\n\n*Open in the menulet Karabiner -> Preferences the tab Change Key\n\n*Hit the ReloadXML button\n\n*Enable the remappings.

Now it's been so long since I did anything with this machine, I don't recall the process... was 10.7.5 an internet-based install?\nWhat options do I have to wipe an old white MacBook?\n\nA: The short answer is...\nUsing OS X boot media or your recovery partition (if available; Command+R), boot into it like you are going to do an install.  However, when you get to the first screen, launch Disk Utility and do a \"Secure Erase\" of your hard drive.\nOnce that is done, you can stop there and have a white MB with no OS or you can continue and install an OS for the next person who becomes the new owner.\nCan your white MB support Internet Recovery?\nIf it is the 2010 model (their last one before resurrecting the line last year) and you had Lion installed with the EFI Firmware update, you can use Internet Recovery.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202313\nThere's no harm in checking...just press Command+Option+R during boot.  If you get to Internet Recovery, then you have it.  If not, then chances are, your MB doesn't support it.\n\nA: Usually I create a USB drive with 10.7 or 10.8 on it and then plug it in, restart the computer and hold the \"C\" key, which will let you choose to boot it from the USB.

She started having problems connecting to the internet right away, and then the rest of the macbooks (about 4 or so) had trouble connecting too. Up in the top bar at the top of the screen, the wifi icon shows that it is connected to the internet. But the wifi will turn off and on, and we figured out it had to do with the macs connecting to an ipv6 network. Every time it connects to an ipv6 network, it can't display any webpages. But anytime it connects to an ipv4 network, you can access anything that requires internet. Does anybody know about this?\n\nA: From my understanding, if you have both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity, the Mac operating system will try both and determine which is fastest. The problem is if the IPv6 DNS returns an IPv6 address that can not be reached, then the computer waits until it times out. This happens even it the IPv4 network reaches the web site. The only reasonable solution is to configure IPv6 as Link-local only.\n\n\n*\n\n*Under System Preferences select Network.\n\n*Select the type of connection. (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.)\n\n*Select Advanced...\n\n*Select the TCP/IP tab.\n\n*Select Link-local only as shown below.\n\n*Click on OK.\n\n*Click on Apply.\n\n\n\nLink-local only means the IPv6 addressing will work for your Local Area Network (LAN), but is disabled on the Wide Area Network (WAN).\nBTW, Microsoft has a fix for this, but only for Windows users. Download \"Perfer IPv4 over IPv6 in prefix policies\" from this site. There is way to make a similar change to the prefix policies used by the underlying Unix on a Mac. Unfortunately, from my understanding, OS X will ignore the change.\n", "Q: How can I easily test sound (speakers and Mic) on my ipad?

But would be good to test both at the same time.\nThanks!\n\nA: Take a video of anything (yourself, your pets, traffic, etc.)  and while recording, say something.  Replay the video.  If you hear the sound you are supposed to, it works. \nThis has the benefits of testing both at the same time and ruling out hardware issues should you run into difficulties during the webinar.\n", "Q: Can MBP 13 mid 2012 send audio and video through thunderbolt to HDMI?

How do I go back and view contacts, etc. on my mac?\n\nA: If you are just backing up your phone via wifi to your Mac there isn't a native tool to view the contacts.  (There are some third party tools, but I don't think that is what you need).  If you are syncing your iPhone to your Mac then they should show up in the contacts app.\nMore likely is that your contacts are being synced to whatever account you are using (gmail, yahoo, iCloud, etc...) and you just need to configure that account on your Mac and then you will see the contacts that way.\n\nA: If your task is to view contacts on an iTunes backup of your iOS device when the original contacts have been lost you can either restore the backup to a different  iOS device, or use apps like iExplorer to export the data you need.\n[Disclaimer: I'm a satisfied, paying customer who uses iExplorer every day.

I'm just curious about something. So I have my iPad with a touch ID and I thought I set it up not to ask me for my Apple ID password in the settings:\n\nSo today I was trying to write a review for an app in the App Store:\n\nand what do you know, it wants my Apple ID password and the fingerprint reader does not work for it.\nAm I not setting something right? I thought the whole premise of selling us this touch ID thing is so that we won't have to type our passwords ever again. What am I missing here?\nPS. For whoever wants to know what's so difficult about typing in my Apple password, I'd tell you that since not so long ago, after Apple had the \"Fappening\" breach of celebrity pictures over iCloud, I changed my password to something like this \"ih1!G832R5a1t2WlDLxt*eeFV\" to prevent it from happening to my account. So as you can imagine, it's not easy to type it at a whim... especially for something as trivial as leaving an app review.\n\nA: All indications are that Touch ID can only be used for purchases.

Screen size is 13\".\n\nA: I assume you are trying to install a 64 bit version of Windows 10 because your processor is 64 bit. After Reviewing the web site Install Windows 7 and earlier on your Mac using Boot Camp, I found Apple documents only 32 bit versions of Windows 7, Vista or XP are designed to run on your Mac Book (2008).\nThe computer used to enter this answer is a 20\" mid 2007 iMac running 64 bit Windows 10 Pro. The same web site documents that my iMac can not run 64 bit versions of Windows, so this site can be wrong. On the other hand, just because I can do it does not mean you will be able.\nThe first thing I would check is the Mac's firmware. Current Apple firmware can be found at this site: About EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers.\nNeither of our Macs can boot the Windows 10 installer from a USB flash drive. So, there is no point to trying that method to install Windows 10.\nMy iMac can not boot from a standard 64 bit Windows installation DVD. This is because these DVDs contain both the BIOS/MBR and EFI/GPT methods of booting. When you tried your DVD, the icon labeled \"Windows\" was the BIOS/MBR method and the icon labeled \"EFI\" was the EFI/GPT method. If you are having the same problem as me, you would have to remove the EFI/GPT method from the DVD. Unfortunately, this requires a machine running Windows. The procedure is given at “Select CD-ROM Boot Type:” error during Windows install.\nThe XP, Vista and Windows 7 32 bit DVDs only contain the BIOS/MBR method of booting. I assume this is also true for Windows 8, 8.1 and 10. If you can find a 32 DVD,  you could test to see if dual booting is your problem. You can download a free 90 day trial of 32 bit Windows 10 Enterprise at this site.\nAnother option will be to install VirtualBox on you Mac. Since you are using OS X 10.7, you would need to download and install the last version 4.3 release of VirtualBox. This would allow you to test the DVD by booting from the DVD in a Virtual environment. You could also install Window 10 in the virtual environment, but I am afraid your Mac is to slow for this to be of any use. (If you do, be careful not to active the Windows 10. To be safe, maybe you should not be connected to the internet while using the virtual machine.)\nYou could use VirtualBox to just install Windows to Mac's Boot Camp partition  and then run a physical version of Windows 10 without the aid of VirtualBox. The difference between this method, and directly using the DVD, would be that you could remove the EFI files before booting the Windows 10 installer. The procedure would be a merger of the instructions given here and here.\nI am sure I have not answered all you questions. Feel free to post comments with additional questions.\nBTW, the partition tables you added to your question look good. The output from the command gpt shows the GUID Partition Table (GPT) used by OS X. The command fdisk shows the legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table that will be used by Windows. The first entry in both tables is the (hidden) EFI partition. This partition always starts at different values in the tables, but ends at the same value. The next three are your OS X, (hidden) OS X Recovery and Boot Camp partitions. The negative values appear to be a bug in fdisk. The values are suppose to be printed as unsigned values. What is shown are signed values. You can convert to the correct values by adding 2 to the 32nd power (i.e. 4294967296). In other words:\nfdisk value                gpt value \n-1861551096 + 4294967296 = 2433416200\n-1861141456 + 4294967296 = 2433825840\n-1859870720 + 4294967296 = 2435096576\n\n\nA: Brother I'll give you some sincere advice- Any mac under 4gb ram and older than the 2012 model should stay away as far as possible from Windows 10. I have installed Windows 10 in more than 4 ways and have been devastated in every scenario cause my mac was slower than a snail every time. I have exactly the same mac as you. But if you insist, here's what I've done:\n\n*\n\n*Back up your Mac.\n\n*Download tuxera 2015 (specific version)\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*Create partition and name it Windows, formatted as tuxera ntfs (if this works forget step 1, if it doesn't you'll have to reinstall macOS on your mac again and start from step 2)\n\n*Download Windows 10 .iso and mount it\n\n*Copy all folders to the windows partition and label them red color\n\n*After that you can install refit mac\n\n*Open refit and copy EFI onto the Macintosh HD\n\n*Open terminal and drag and drop refit folder in the terminal window and press enter. Write password and press enter.\n\n*After that write another a code in terminal as follows: ./enable.sh\n\n*Now you just restart and choose windows from refit boot menu\n\nThat's it, just go through the installation.\nAfter that you have to install some app called drivethelife or something (i dont remember look it up) and install the drivers.\nRestart in macOS and delete the color labeled folders from windows and if you want to delete refit just delete the EFI folder from Macintosh HD.\n\nA: It is indeed the boot EFI pointing problem. Simple fix by pointing boot sequence in the Startup disk; Windows 10 installer will boot up from there.\n", "Q: Applescript: automated key press of spacebar/left click at defined intervals I'm new to apple scripts and was wondering if there is a way the program the computer to press spacebar or left-click at defined times upon running of the script.\nFor instance I will be able to same I want the system to press space bar then 2 after press it again and 1.4 seconds later press it again and so on.\nThe program I will have running will be Chrome. Also would it be possible that this script be executed upon the pressing on the first space bar?\n\nA: Pretty easy!\nTo simulate a space bar click use tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke [key]. Clicking is a bit more difficult. If you want to click at a given point you can use tell application [process] to click at {x-cord,y-cord}. However, if you want to have it just click at whatever point it's at, you'll probably have to use a third party shell application like Cliclick.\nNow combine that with the delay [seconds] command and you're good!\n", "Q: Ipad mini 4 won't turn on I just got my ipad mini 4 for christmas.

Attempt starting the MacBook Pro to Target Disk Mode. While the working Mac is on, and the MacBook Pro is off–but connected to power–and both computers are connected to each other via a Firewire cable: press the power button on the MacBook Pro and immediately press and hold the T key on its keyboard. Normally, you will begin to see a Target Disk Mode screensaver on the target Mac and its hard disk drive will mount to the filesystem of the working Mac. If neither the screensaver appears or the drive is mounted, check the System Information app on the working Mac and select Firewire from the list. Verify if there are any signs that the Firewire port is connected to a computer.\nIf that fails, it highly likely that the power connector and/or logic board are broken.  \n", "Q: \"This item is temporarily unavailable\" When Installing Yosemite I have erased my HD and tried to install OS Yosemite on MacBook Pro mid 2009. But keep getting this message \"This item is temporarily unavailable.\" I've tried many proposed solutions but none seem to work. Any one experienced a similar problem?\n\nA: Let me preface this: it's possible that this solution doesn't work entirely, and that you'll need a version of the installer that has a full copy of OS X (instead of downloading it from the internet on the fly.)\nWith that said, here's the issue. Your Apple ID (and therefore purchases) are not associated with the computer you're trying to install to since it's a clean install. Therefore, it doesn't know you've \"purchased\" Yosemite previously, and since it's no longer on the app store, isn't giving you access. What you need to do is reassociate your Apple ID with that computer. The recommended solution is to log into icloud.com.\nAlternatively (or if that doesn't work), you can download it from another computer with a working version of OS X and then execute the installer from there (or create a bootable installer from there.)\nSmall side question: why not install El Cap?\n\nA: Finally the problem solved... I have noticed there is no Yosemite update purchased in my App Store account! So looked in the accounts of my family members and found one in my son's account. I used his account in the installation screen and it worked.\nThanks all who tried to help :)\n\nA: Checked that you're Apple Id is connected to the correct App Store region.\nThe easiest way is, in App Store, select go Store > View My Account ...\nA check will be made if the App Store region will be checked, and, if they're out of sync, at this point, the correct region for your Apple Id will be selected.\nAfter this point, you should be able to install apps and updates from the App Store.\n", "Q: How Install Beamer Themes in OS X?

I was wondering if I can purchase an iCloud locked iphone cheaply and use it as an iPod touch - ie all the features except the phone, as I don't want it for the phone. Or are the features disabled when it is iCloud locked?\n\nA: If you purchase a phone which is activation-locked via iCloud, you will not be able to use any features on it at all. This is different than a \"locked\" phone by carrier, which means that it can only be used on a certain carrier (such as AT&T). If that's the case, then the phone will work as a more robust iPod touch.\n", "Q: Know how many windows are open for an app at a glance Is there a way to know at a glance how many windows are open for an app?\nIn the dock, using El Capitan, a black dot appears under running app icons, but if windows are on top of each other (i.e. Chrome main window, and Chrome Gmail composing new mail popup), there seem to be no way of knowing it without doing an Exposé of the app.\n\nA: I would say the quickest way is to right click/ctrl-click/hold down on the dock icon. This opens a menu, where you can see all the open windows, even those in full screen, which do not appear in App Exposé. As this menu can grow to be quite long, you want to look for the section with the icon  on each line, and a tick next to one of the elements.

Is it possible to move files using mouse only?\n\nA: Aren't you still talking about drag and drop? If you are trying to move something from one Directory in Finder to another, you can drag the file out of the current directory and into the directory on the side bar. For example, if you have text.txt in Documents, and you want to move it to the desktop, you can drag it to Desktop in the sidebar, and it will place the file on the desktop.\n", "Q: Find all hidden files that were hidden using the command \"chflags hidden filename\"? I remember to hide an important file, but I can't find it anymore and I don't remember the name. I don't remember how I hid it, i.e., if just by inserting a prefix of . or using chflags hidden filename.\nI tried to recover all hidden files (hidden because of the prefix .) under my desktop using the following command\nfind . -name '.*' | grep \"^.DS_Store\" > hidden-files.txt\n\nand the resulting hidden-files.txt text file is empty. (Anyway, I'm not 100% sure if the command above is correct.)\nAgain, now I would like to retrieve recursively (as I'm doing with the previous command) all hidden files that were hidden using the command chflags hidden filename using the terminal (or without, but I would need to have a list of them or a path to them). Is it possible? If yes, how can I do it?\nEdit 1\nI think the command above doesn't work because grep does not accept input. Anyway, to solve the problem I think I just need to add xargs as follows\nfind . -name '.*' | xargs grep \"^.DS_Store\" > hidden-files.txt\n\n\nA: This should work for you\nfind . ! -name '.' \\( -name '.*' -o -flags hidden \\)\n\nwhich means find in the current directory, all file system objects, except do not list the current working directory- (! -name '.'), whose name begins with a dot or file flag is set to hidden.\n", "Q: How do I remove everything Parallels?

Basically, the Other folder is anything that cannot be recognized as Audio, Video, Photos, Apps, and Backups. If you want to free up some space in here, you need to navigate to your home folder, and move any files to the Trash that you don't need. Then, empty the trash. If there are still files taking up a lot of space that you really need, you can compress them.

I have one that works but it is only available in the Services menu when text is selected.  I need it to be available when there is no text selected.\nHere is the Automator Services script:\n\nThe application I'm trying to use the service with is TextEdit.  I'm seeing the same behavior in other applications like TextMate and Pages: few or no entries in the Services menu until I select some text, then lots of Services available.\nPerhaps there is some way to do this with AppleScript, like getting the text onto the clipboard and sending a \"command-V\" to the application.  But I would still need the AppleScript to be available in the Services menu somehow.\n\nA: I found the answer here:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/589184/finder-not-enabling-use-of-services-when-changing-service-receives-selected-in\n\nOS X sometimes ignores changes to services after they've been saved in Automator, possibly due to caching. So if the service started out as a text service, chances are your changes aren't getting picked up. To circumvent this problem, select File » Duplicate in Automator and save the service under a new name, and try again. Then delete the original service from ~/Library/Services.\n\n(Answer is by Daniel Beck)\nI duplicated my Service script (in Automator) as suggested above and now it shows up in the Services menu without needing to select text.  I suspect when I first created the script that I had \"Service receives text input\" selected, and then I changed it later.  Note that also checking \"Output replaces selected text\" should not be changed after first saving the Service.\n", "Q: How to package Quicklook plugins for AppStore I developed a bunch of specialized Quicklook plugins and would like to share them through the App store.

I was wondering if it's possible to colour a recognised command in real time while typing and/or when switching to previous commands using the arrows.\nFor example, if I start typing gre, it should not color anything, but once I finish typing my command completely, i.e. grep, it should color grep with a certain color.\nThis would be useful to immediately recognise also the position of arguments in a complex command. I'm using the default terminal that comes with the notebook.\n\nA: Not a bash answer, as I don't have one, but if you switch your shell to zsh (a close relative of bash) and install the configuration framework prezto you'll get this functionality more or less out of the box, as well as significantly better autocompletion. Switching to zsh most likely won't change your day to day bash workflow at all, but it'll open a a lot of doors in terms of customisation and extension, and also adds some clever features worth learning - like shared command history across all prompts that can be included in the autocompletion dictionary, file globbing to efficiently work with multiple files at once, and most importantly compatibility modes, whereby zsh can emulate another shell - meaning that if some of your bash scripts don't work the way they used to after switching to zsh, you can just emulate it - although personally all the bash scripts I've written still worked fine in zsh. \nUseful links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing the latest version of zsh in OS X\n\n*Installing prezto\n\n*Some in-depth discussion of how switching can improve your workflow\n", "Q: Mixing 10/1000 Device w/ other Gigabit Devices to Apple Airport Extreme My Mac Minis (which support Gigabit Ethernet) are physically connected through Gigabit Ethernet to my current generation Apple Airport Extreme (which has Gigabit Ethernet switch ports).  \nIf I add a Apple Airport Express (which is a 10/100 Mbps device does not support Gigabit) will it negatively affect network transfer speeds between the Mac Minis?

The RAID card hides the actual hardware from diskutil and Disk Utility so they are of less use than if you were doing a fusion drive or software RAID.\nAs to the proper setup - that really depends on which tradeoff you wish to make. Speed comes at the cost of reliability. Redundancy (or mirroring) can provide a speed up for reads but a slight slow down for writes. You'll also want to check the battery status and replace that as well as make sure you have backups of the data since RAID is not a backup but just a way to optimize for one aspect of storage over another.\nOnce you have a handle on the actual hardware and how the RAID card is using the drives, perhaps ask a follow on question on your options for changing things and/or a basic question asking what RAID 1 or 0 or 5 are if that's of concern.\n", "Q: How can I forward all my iCloud emails to a Gmail address?

The computer (only 3 years old) has slowed down significantly in the last few months, especially when opening directories containing large amounts of files and when loading large documents in Photoshop and other applications. I had doubled my RAM (as a bandaid solution) and that seemed to make a difference for a while, but I now I need to do something about it.\nThe question is, after I've backed up all of my files onto an external drive with Time Machine and performed the clean install, how do I know what files are safe to copy back into my system? Thanks in advance for the help.\n\nA: The short answer is that there is no easy way to know what files have been corrupted and what impact they may have.\nThe best solution is to rely as little as possible on the files on the old backup. You have made a good start by doing a clean OS install. Now re-install all applications from scratch, preferably by downloading brand new installers. Once you have done that then get all your documents, music and other data files from the backup but not such things as your Library folder. Thi means you will have to set the preferences on all your applications again.\nThis is a lot of work but the safest way to do a clean install.\n", "Q: How to specify DNS server with USB hotspot?

I noticed that there's clear delay between sound event and sound being audible via the JBL. \nThe problems persists across applications (so for example, playing video via VLC means the sound isn't synced, same for youtube videos in different browsers, same for mp3s that start playing with a small delay, etc.)\nThe delay is minor, but noticeable, in the range of 0.5s I'd say.\nAt first I thought it might be a Bluetooth driver issues, but now I found out the following: just connected another JBL device, a Flip 3 to the same MBA, and the sound plays without noticeable delay. I'm not sure if they use the exact same drivers, but now I'm wondering:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a chance that it's a hardware problem? Didn't really consider this a possibility, but now I'm not sure anymore.\n\n*How to test, and, ideally, fix this issue? How can I isolate the reason for the audio lag with the Charge 2+?\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nA: Bluetooth lag is a known problem with some, but not all, remote speakers, headsets, etc. We have several Vizio sound bars that have a definite lag, but a Harmon-Kardon speaker set that doesn't. In some cases, adjusting a specific Bluetooth system parameter in Terminal can help with the lag. This works on some of our Vizio sound bars, but we had to hard-wire others to guarantee no video syncing issues.\nsudo defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent \"Apple Bitpool Min (editable)\" -int 40\nThe -int value can be experimented with to troubleshoot, but I'd be cautious and not be too extreme in the values you try.\nI found this information at this link and this one.\n\nA: This is issue with the speaker. JBL Charge 2 and Charge 2+ have lag even in the wired AUX input, because it does signal processing with DSP instead of being a simple analog amplifier! JBL Charge 3 does not have the lag in AUX input. I am not sure if bluetooth of Charge 3 is less laggy or not, but chances are that also has improved latency due to newer bluetooth standards and the DSP apparently being faster / less buffering.\n\nA: The Charge 4 has a delayed audio response, about .5 sec, if not less. The Flip 3 did not delay audio reproduction. The JBL/Harman website features refurbished products: refurbished products, and products manufactured in many unauthorized factories (U.S. Federal Departments actively take action against such factories, with publications of unauthorized factories in other countries: many of the biggest name musical instrument models, microphones, an others do not fully function up to specs.

It was internet sharing that @Daniel wanted, not port forwarding. My mistake. I'm leaving this answer here for the sake of informing about port forwarding, but this isn't the best solution for how to solve this problem.\nSure! You're trying to accomplish port forwarding, which a variety of programs can do. If you like using Apple software with a nice GUI, OS X Sever works fine. @klanomath has told me that \"OS X Server neither allows port forwarding nor NAT/Routing. Not allowing neither of both it doesn't provide a GUI\", so I've removed this suggestion.\nipfw used to be the default for port forwarding. However, it's since been deprecated for pfctl. I personally am very dumb and don't really know what's happening when you use it. I'll paste the (heavily summarized) contents of a GitHub instruction thing. Create an anchor file under /etc/pf.anchors/<anchor file> with your redirection rule like: rdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to ABC.ABC.ABC.AB port AB-AB -> AAA.BBB.CCC.DD port XX-YY. To my knowledge, I don't know of any nice GUI clients.\nSSH also supports tunneling. For you, you'll probably want to use the command ssh -D AAA.BBB.CCC.DD:XX-YY. There's also a variety of clients that you can use to make managing this a bit easier than via the command line.\nYou can also configure it at the level of your router. Obviously this depends on your router, but portforward.com has instructions for lots of routers (as does Google.) For example, you can use AirPort Utility to configure port forwarding.\nBut don't be restricted! Look around, there's tons upon tons of software and methods of doing this.\n", "Q: Import Keynote Animation to iMovie I have a Keynote file with a lot of animations on the slides.

It appears my Thunderbolt Ethernet connector has stopped connecting to my router for good today. Over the last few days I had already seen my ethernet connection \"crash\" multiple times. My machine would simply drop from the network and not be able to get back on without a restart. I assumed there was some odd bug somewhere, maybe triggered by certain network activity,  but since I could solve it with a restart, it didn't make me concerned.\nNow, when opening the System Preferences under Network I only see the Status: Not Connected message` for the Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter. I am using a MacBook Pro Retina (Early 2013) and an AirPort Time Capsule (in the more recent 802.11ac tower version). I have tried various solutions that one can find online, but none of those worked.\n\n\n*\n\n*I am sure the Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter and network cables are working fine - when using a MacBook Air everything connects just fine. I also happen to have a second Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter and it displays the exact same issues.\n\n*I am more or less convinced that the Thunderbolt Port on the MBP is also working - when checking in System Report > Thunderbolt I can at least see the Thunderbolt Bus and a Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, which is listed as Device Connected. I can't be 100% sure of this though, but it appears to recognise me attaching that adapter.\n\n*It doesn't matter which one of the two Thunderbolt ports I use, neither of them work.\nIs there any good way to try and troubleshoot the Thunderbolt connectivity? Are there any specific settings that I should try to reset?\nI had found a suggestion to reset the network settings by [A] deleting this file: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist, but unfortunately, that didn't work and appeared to have no effect at all. [B]\nI have also added a new location and removed old ones from the Networks Preferences Pane inside the System Settings, but nothing changed.\nFor some reason the TB Ethernet adapter is not being found or recognised inside the System Preferences and no connection is therefore established.

This using the location Automatic.\nSo from Network Preferences I clicked on Assist me…, then on Assistant, which opened /System/Library/CoreServices/Network Setup Assistant.app. This added another location and detected the connector and it worked (I then deleted Automatic but renamed the new one as Automatic).

After deleting photos any of the apps you deleted could then be reinstalled from their original store at no charge. (If this works, the only possible problem could be if any of the deleted apps aren't current since reinstalling them would bring in the current version which might work differently.)\nIf the problem with deleting photos is dependent on the app you are using to try to delete photos this may work; if it's a problem with lack of space for iOS itself then you'll probably just have the same problem trying to delete apps, too. It can't hurt to try. Hope this helps.\n\nA: You can try using the option of \"Erase all content and settings\".

Booting into safe mode may be doing something to help your GPU (I have an Xserve with a confirmed dying GPU that boots in safe mode but not without it) so it boots properly. I would highly recommend getting your MacBook Pro replaced as soon as possible via the Apple program. I would suggest you run Apple Hardware Test and verify that your GPU is dead/dying, but this may not be possible given your current state. Similarly, you can run a GPU stress test program like Unigine Heaven and see if your GPU quits.\nIn any case, seeing if you can get your computer replaced probably isn't a bad idea since it's pretty likely your GPU is dying. Go to an Apple store, explain the issue, and they'll probably give you a new computer.\n", "Q: Getting only two email accounts to push to iPhone I have six accounts. I've been to the iPhone push tab and have set the two I want to push to push and the rest to manual but they all push. I've rebooted the phone, tried to toggle off and on, and still have all or nothing. I've tried closing out the email application on the iPhone and no joy.\n\nA: I went to Apple Genius. They tested the phone quickly and no faults were found. They tried unsuccessfully to properly configure the phone. They replaced the phone under warrantee, configured the new phone, downloaded my backup from iCloud and it works like it did before this issue. The email accounts that are supposed to push do, and the others do not. Luckily the phone was under warrantee. The Apple Geniuses were very helpful, and made sure that all was in order on the new phone before I left. It took over an hour altogether.\n", "Q: Text in cell with URL hidden I'm trying to copy and paste a number (tracking number) from a UPS notification into a cell on Numbers.  I want the number to appear with the link hidden but it keeps pasting the entire URL in the cell.  Excel did this for me and I am new to numbers.\n\nA: Use the HYPERLINK() function.\nHYPERLINK(url,link-text)\nThe first parameter is the URL as a string in quotes, the second is the tracking number as a string also in quotes.\nFrom the documentation:\n\nHYPERLINK\nThe HYPERLINK function creates a clickable link that opens a webpage\n  or new email message.\nHYPERLINK(url, link-text) url: A standard universal resource locator.\n  url is a string value that must contain a properly formatted universal\n  resource locator string.\nlink-text: An optional string value that specifies the text that\n  appears as a clickable link in the cell. If link-text is omitted, url\n  is used as link-text.\nExamples\n=HYPERLINK(“http://www.apple.com”, “Apple”) creates a link with the text Apple that, when clicked, opens the default web browser to the\n  Apple homepage.\n=HYPERLINK(“mailto:janedoe@example.com?subject=Quote Request”, “Get Quote”) creates a link with the text Get Quote that, when clicked,\n  opens the default email application and addresses a new message to\n  janedoe@example.com with the subject line Quote Request.\n\n\nA: You must not use \"copy link\" when copying the tracking number. Instead use the text copy (cmd-c) command. If you do so, the number will be pasted, not the underlying link.  \n", "Q: Is there a terminal emulator for Mac OS X that supports binding Ctrl+(Shift)+Tab? I want to bind Ctrl+Tab to \\033[27;5;9~ and Ctrl+Shift+Tab to \\033[27;6;9~. Unless I am missing something, the default Mac OS X terminal emulator will not let you bind these key sequences to custom escape sequences like it does with the \"F\" keys (F1, F2, etc.) and most other keys.\nIs there another terminal emulator I can use on Mac OS X that does support rebinding those keys?\n\nA: Yes.  There is a product called iTerm2.  The best part is that it's FOSS\nOne of the features of iTerm2 is that you can remap any of the keys including the ones you asked about.

But I want it to ring when one particular person calls me. Is this possible?\nI've seen a similar workaround using the do not disturb function, but I don't think that solves my issue. I want it to vibrate on all notifications, texts, and calls, except ring when one particular person calls.\n\nA: Buy a 'silence' ringtone from the iTunes Store. Make this your default tone, except for that one person. \n\nA: You cannot do this, as you cannot define exceptions to the Mute toggle. Here are the possibilities I see, none of which solve your problem exactly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable all sounds for all apps, including ringtones (you can do this by making a blank ringtone file yourself, or by getting one from the iTunes Store). Then go into that one contact and assign a ringtone to them. However, disabling app sounds also disables their vibrations.\n\n*Using Do Not Disturb allows you to specify a group of contacts that will bypass the setting, causing your iPhone to ring. You can find this setting under Settings → General → Do Not Disturb → Allow Calls From. Again, this will also disable vibrations, as you appear to know already.\n\n*In the overkill category, you could get an Apple Watch. Notifications will transfer to your Watch and not ring or vibrate your iPhone. You can then disable sounds without disabling taps on the Watch. When you get a phone call, your iPhone will still ring (this is the one exception to notifications on Apple Watch). From there, disable all ringtones except for that one contact as I described in 1.\n\n\nA: While this was not possible at the time of the question, there is now a \"None\" option in the text tone vibration settings on a contact's card.\n\nA: Record a silent ringtone or find a free one. Make that your default ringtone. Then adjust the ringtone for that contact. Ideally, you would be able to set a ringtone per contact group like you can with Android and other phones but not with apple.\nHere are steps to create your own ringtone ref\nHow to Convert a Voice Memo into Ringtone for iPhone\nBefore you go ahead with the procedure, you’ll need to download GarageBand from the App Store. In order to use this technique to convert your audio recording into a ringtone, your device needs to be running iOS 11 or later. You’ll also need to record audio first using the Voice Memos app. Once you’re done, simply follow the steps below for making a custom ringtone.\n1. Open the “Voice Memos” app on your iPhone.\n\n2. Your previous recordings will show up here. Tap on the recording that you want to set as your ringtone and press the “triple-dot” icon for more options.\n\n3. This will open the iOS share sheet. Tap on “Save to Files” to save this recording within the Files app.\n\n4. Choose a preferred directory to save the recording and tap on “Save”.\n\n5. Next, Open the GarageBand app on your device.\n\n6. Choose any instrument that’s available. It doesn’t matter which instrument you choose, as the procedure is going to remain the same. In this instance, we’re choosing Keyboard.\n\n7. Once you’ve opened the instrument, tap on the “project” icon as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n8. Here, tap on the “loop” icon located at the top-right corner in order to open your audio recording.\n\n9. Make sure you’re under the “Files” section and then choose “Browse items from the Files app”.\n\n10. This will open your Files directory within the GarageBand app. Find and tap on the audio recording you saved in Voice Memos.\n\n11. In this step, long-press the file name in order to open it in the project menu within GarageBand.\n\n12. Drop the file as the second track, because the first track by default is reserved for the instrument you chose.\n\n13. Now, tap on this track and drag the ends to trim the audio recording according to your preferences. You can play it back using the “Play” icon located at the top, if necessary. However, you might want to disable the annoying metronome by pressing the icon located to the right of “record” icon.\n\n14. Once you’re done adjusting your clip, make sure it’s under 40 seconds in length. Now, tap on the “downward arrow” icon at the top-left corner and select “My Songs”.\n\n15. Your GarageBand project will show up under Recents as “My Song”. Long-press on it to access more options.\n\n16. Now, tap on “Share” as shown below.\n\n17. In this step, select “Ringtone” in order to export your project as a ringtone.\n\n18. Now, you can give the ringtone a name of your choice. Once you’re done, tap “Export” located at the top-right corner of the screen.\n\n19. Once the export is successful, tap on “Use sound as…” in order to set it as your default ringtone right within GarageBand.\n\n20. Here, you can choose to set it as your default ringtone or a text tone. Additionally, you also have the option to assign the sound to a specific contact. However, if you just want to add it to the list of existing ringtones, tap on “Done” instead.\n\nNow you’ve learned how to set your voice recordings as a custom ringtone by using GarageBand on your iPhone.\n\nA: Yes you can easily!\ngo to the contact in your iphone from the contact menu, then click \"ringtone\" scroll to the top and there is an \"Emergency Bypass\" option\nenable it\nThere you go!\n", "Q: Show ringtones and books in iTunes library In my iTunes (12.3.2) I want to have ringtones and books show up under library.

\"solved\" it.\nI haven't heard back from the support yet though, but there seems to be an issue with the coolant paste to the north bridge. I'll see when I actually have time to turn it in. It goes from ca 40C to 95C in mere seconds when the fans are off.\nThe reason for \"overheating\" (ie quotation marks) is that it was not under heavy load, but the \"CPU System Agent Core\"-sensor was showing high values. See this question, CPU System agent core (TC0E/TC0F) running very high, where I in detail go through my temps and sensor data.\n", "Q: Is there a multiple copy/paste app for iOS? I am particularly interested in copying several chunks of text, and then pasting all of them together into another app.\n\nA: I find CopyClip 2 from FIPLAB Ltd very useful - it doesn't merge clips automatically, but it does continually record up to 100 copied pieces of text on an easy-access icon.\n\nA: I believe what you are looking for might be a Clipboard manager. There are a few around for OS X (e.g. https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/copyclip-clipboard-history/id595191960?mt=12) - you can easily find more on Google.\nNow, for iOS I don't believe you can have that exact same functionality, but some apps get close. They can check your clipboard content and you can add any copied text into that app easily as shown here:\nhttp://www.cleanshavenapps.com/clips/\nAnother popular app is found here:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/au/app/clipboard-manager-history/id320175134?mt=8\nI don't think any of these will merge your copied texts automatically, though - you could check out IFTTT to see if you can create your own (or existing) automated recipe. Maybe also Workflow or Launch Centre Pro could help automate this for you.\n\nA: Thanks Chris for the suggestions.\nI found another app called NoteBox, recommended by Federico Vittici but not tried by me, that appears to do something like it.\nI also found a small (and old) one trick pony app called Copy+ HD, last updated 2012 that seemed to have been designed exactly for what I wanted, so I splurged and bought it, even though I feared it would not work any more. Well, it does! It's not perfect but it is closer to this task than any other app I know of. (I did not try Workflow or IFTTT.) \n\nA: Paste is a contemporary alternative with an iCloud synced clipboard. It's possible to concatenate multiple items from the clipboard history. In addition to recent clipboard history, it offers \"Pinboards\" where important clips can be saved, e.g. code snippets, folder paths, images & documnets and so forth. It's possible to preview the files from within the app.\nThere is a trial version available.\n\nA: My favorite is Copyless.\nIt's very lightweight and fairly customizable, allowing you to easily switch to plain-text mode (i.e. clears styling when copying from/to e.g. MS Word) and paste the n-th item in the clipboard history, among other features. And all this beauty is free! Definitely worth a shot.\n", "Q: Re-download OS X iWork suite (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) Apple introduced Pages, Numbers, and Keynote as a Mac native platform for documents such as letters, spreadsheets, and presentations. These applications come pre-loaded with OS X, as they did with my computer, however, after re-installing OS X after having unrelated issues with my computer, I found that these iWork applications were simply no longer there. So, I transferred the suite from a colleague's computer to my own, however, said applications soon became obsolete, as I couldn't update them without my colleague's password. So, I deleted the applications once more, as they were rendered useless.\nThis wasn't too much of a problem until recently, as I began to need the applications for other projects. Whenever I visit the Mac App Store, I'm not able to simply download them, rather, I have to pay money for them. Which, eventually I succumbed to, grudgingly paying the $15 for Pages, but it didn't download. I lost the $15, with no result from the App Store. Pages doesn't show up in the Purchased section of the Store, and there's nothing in my Applications folder that would suggest that it did indeed download.\nAny suggestions? Or does this warrant a visit to the Genius Bar?\nSpecs: iMac 27\" Late 2013 running OS X 10.11 El Capitan\n\nA: When you bought your Mac, you were prompted to \"accept\" the applications in the iWork suite, to be attached to your Apple ID for future download. \nIf you did not do this, I suggest calling Apple Support or taking a trip to the Genius Bar. If you provide them your Mac's proof of purchase, they should be able to give you a redeem code for the App Store to download the suite. This will also link the apps to your Apple ID signed in on the Mac App Store for future download.\n", "Q: My External hard drive fell and not showing up on Mac 1 week back my 1TB Seagate Expansion external hard drive which I used for Time Machine backup fell on ground. I freaked out and immediately connected it back to Mac. and to my horror the drive didn’t showed up neither desktop nor on Disk utility. I checked it again and found that the light was still on. There were no sounds which indicate physical damage I mean clicking, buzzing, tickling or damaged component sound. I looked on the web to scan this hard drive with some software and found this link http://www.stellarinfo.com/support/kb/index.php/article/recover-mac-time-machine-drive but again the drive isn’t getting recognized by the software. Thisa drive is no longer in warranty. Could someone let me know how should I open the hard drive safely? What tools I might require? Will changing the enclosure bring back this drive? I still believe the hard drive might be OK since there is no signs of physical damaged and its light is still on. Please help ….\n\nA: The drive enclosure may be broken, but it could also be the drive itself, being the logic board or head. It's more likely the drive is broken if it was powered on when it fell. Since it's your backup drive, you hopefully haven't lost anything critical. I'd start thinking about getting a second backup drive to reduce your exposure to loss.\nMost USB externals are fairly easy to take apart with a screwdriver, and just have a standard SATA drive inside of them. If you have a SATA to USB adapter you can test it, or even better is to connect to an internal SATA to verify S.M.A.R.T. etc. However a 1TB drive is pretty cheap now, so you might just replace instead of trying to repair.\n", "Q: Launchd script to mount volume on boot I have a script monta.sh to mount an external volume:\n#!bin/sh\nmkdir -p /Volumes/remvol\nmount_smbfs //user:password@server/folder /Volumes/remvol\n\nThen I have a com.jo.monta.plist to launch the script after system boot placed in /Library/LaunchDaemons:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.jo.monta</string>\n    <key>Disabled</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>UserName</key>\n    <string>admin</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/admin/scripts/monta.sh</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>SuccessfulExit</key>\n        <false/>\n    </dict>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nI've tested the script from the command line and it works, however if I log in after boot the volume is not mounted.\nIt seems like the plist file doesn't load? what's wrong?\n\nA: The script and the plist work perfectly well if you make following changes:\nadd a slash in /Users/admin/scripts/monta.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\nmkdir -p /Volumes/remvol\nmount_smbfs //user:password@server/folder /Volumes/remvol\n\nproper ownership of com.jo.monta.plist:\nsudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jo.monta.plist\n\nproper file mode bits of /Users/admin/scripts/monta.sh:\nchmod 755 /Users/admin/scripts/monta.sh\n\nload the launch daemon:\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jo.monta.plist\n\n", "Q: Finder/Quicklook Bug (File Icon Previews Not Working) My Macbook has suddenly stopped generating preview icon of all file types. So all files are now replaced by their respective generic file type icons (see picture attached). Moreover, when I quicklook any file, the preview appears corrupted. \nI have not updated any software recently, nor have I modified any file systems. \nAny help would be much appreciated! \n\n\nA: Per comment under original question, first thing I'd try (which turned out to be the solution) would be to run sudo qlmanage -r in a terminal, which resets the QuickLook subsystem.\n\nA: Merely running sudo qlmanage -r did not fix this issue for me.\nFor me, the direct cause was QLStephen.qlgenerator. The issue happened overnight and I suspect Apple's latest silent OS X update may have played a part in this. I removed the plugin the same way I installed it (Homebrew); if you manually installed it, simply drag it out of the plugins folder in your Library and run sudo qlmanage -r\nThong.qlgenerator also caused an issue for me (PNG only showed as an icon).\n\nA: From MacRumors:\n\n*\n\n*Open Activity Monitor\n\n*Search for a process called `com.apple.quicklook.ThumbnailsAgent``\n\n*Force quit the process\n\n*Force quite Finder (from the Force Quit menu)\n\n\n", "Q: Ethernet not working on MacBook pro retina 13 My Ethernet connection is not working on my computer (mid 2015). \nI already rebooted, deleting the files \"NetworkInterfaces.plist\" and \"preferences.plist\" into the folder \"/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration\".\nI opened a terminal window, giving this command\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder; say DNS cache flushed\n\nand then I rebooted again.\nBut nothing seems to work.\nAny idea?\nHere I give the system information screen, it is Italian, sorry for this. However it says no ethernet driver is installed (could the issue be with this?) and the Thunderbolt tab says \"no device connected\" also when the ethernet adapter is there.\nI also tried to connect a VGA adaptor in order to connect a monitor and this works, so it is not the thunderbolt port.\n\n\nA: If this is recent, you may be the victim of a bad malware protection update from Apple. They have posted a support article explaining how to check if this was the cause, and how to fix it.\n\nFirst, check your version number\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*While pressing the Option key, choose System Information from the\n  Apple menu.  \n  \n*Expand the Software section and select Installations.\n  \n*Click the Software Name column header to sort the list\n  alphabetically.\n  \n*Look for “Incompatible Kernel Extension\n  Configuration Data.” If the most recent version installed is 3.28.1,\n  follow the steps below.\n  \n  \n  If you can connect to Wi-Fi, follow these steps to update to version 3.28.2\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Terminal app.\n  \n*Enter this command to update to the current version of the “Incompatible Kernel Extension Configuration Data” kernel extension: \n  sudo softwareupdate --background\n  \n*Quit Terminal and restart your Mac. \n  \n  \n  If you can't connect to Wi-Fi, follow these steps to update to version 3.28.2\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Restart from OS X Recovery by holding down Command-R while your Mac starts up.\n  \n*Select Disk Utility from the list of OS X Utilities.\n  \n*Select your drive from the list of internal drives in the sidebar. The default name is “Macintosh HD.” Your drive might have a different name or location, if you renamed or moved it.\n  \n*If the drive name is dimmed, your drive might be protected by FileVault. Choose File > Unlock from the Disk Utility menu, then enter your FileVault password. \n  \n*Choose File > Mount in Disk Utility to mount your drive, if it's not already mounted. \n  \n*Quit Disk Utility. \n  \n*To make it easier to enter the command shown in step 9, you might want to copy it from Safari:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Choose Get Help Online from the OS X Utilities list, then go to support.apple.com/kb/HT205956.\n  \n*Select the command in step 9, copy it, then quit Safari before you continue to the next step. \n  \n  \n*Choose Utilities > Terminal to open the Terminal app.\n  \n*Type or paste the following command as one line in Terminal, then press Return.

For example in Linux, we can copy executables or binaries to /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin. So similar to that where can I copy executables in OS X? I have downloaded Firefox and copied it to /Applications. Now I want to execute Firefox from any area without going in to the /Applications.\n\nA: /usr/local/bin is a suitable path for non-GUI applications. For example, you might put rsync 3.0 in there as compiled 'rsync3'.\nThis folder is listed in $PATH by default.\n\nA: While /Applications is the central repository for installed Applications on OS X, you can put any executable anywhere and launch them from anywhere within terminal so long as its directory is in your path.  \nThe question is, why exactly do you want to launch things like a browser, which is graphical in nature from the command line?  \nIf you just want to type the name of the application, simply invoke Spotlight by pressing Command+Spacebar and start typing.  It's how I normally launch apps that I don't have in my dock.\n\nA: You could find all executable locations with the following command:\necho $PATH\n\n", "Q: How can I prevent stuck keys when VNC into OS X El Capitan loses focus? tl;dr: I'd like to avoid OS X thinking the [Command] key is being held down when I [Alt][Tab] away from a Windows TightVNC session, or at least get the [Command] key to auto-release after a period of time.\nI'm using TightVNC on a Windows 8 x64 box to access a Mac OS X El Capitan box through standard built-in OS X Screen Sharing.\nThe combination works great for my purposes, with one exception: when TightVNC has focus and I hit [Alt][Tab] on the Windows box to switch focus to another application, the OS X understandably sees the [Alt] key go down, but never come back up.\nBecause the Windows [Alt] key maps to the OS X [Command] key, the OS X box is left thinking I never released the [Command] key.\nTherefore, when I return to the TightVNC session a minute, hour, or month later and begin typing, the results are often surprising and sometimes bad, because OS X still thinks the [Command] key is depressed.\nIs there a way I can avoid this situation without relying on changing my habits, which hasn't yet worked out for me after a year of occasionally getting burned by this? :)\nI'm thinking the a good approach would be something running under OS X that watches for the [Command] key being depressed for several seconds, and forcibly \"unsticks\" it.  Such a gimmick wouldn't create any problems for my workflow, but I don't know of a way to accomplish it.\n\nA: Best solution I've found is to click the blank space in the menu bar, and often.  The left Alt key is mapped to command on my Mac from this PC, and I'll Alt-tab in windows or in my viewer and the Alt key sticks, so all clicks are Command-clicks in the Mac.  So I quite often just Alt-click the menu bar to clear that stuck key.\n", "Q: Booting gets stuck for a minute when using Bootcamp on Windows 10 I installed Windows 10 using the official ISO and one of the serials I have with MSDN. When I reboot my Macbook Air 2013 it gets stuck on a black screen for around a minute and then start loading Windows. I only have a windows partition at the moment.\nI tried resetting the NVRAM. Didn't help. \nI followed the advice here but that didn't help either since it seems to be for Windows 7 only.\n\nA: You probably have not blessed the Windows partition. On a Mac, the blessed partition is the one that the firmware will try to boot first.\nOpen the control panel and select the Boot Camp icon to open the window. Choose to reboot to the Windows partition. This should \"bless\" the windows partition. \n", "Q: Can hear boot noise but no other sound I have a MacBook Air A1237. I can hear the \"dong\" from startup, but in OS I couldn't hear anything.\nIn System Preferences, as output, I see only headphones. If I plug in a headphone I can hear sounds, music. If I plug out this, nothing happend. The internal speakers are not showed. \nI've tried to reset NVRAM and SMC, install a new copy of OS, same problems.\nI tried to clean with a toothpick, nothing happened. Any other idea to solve the problem?\n\nA: Generally, this issue indicates a stuck pin in the headphone jack and/or a hardware issue with the sound driver.\nFor the headphone jack, take your headphones and RAPIDLY plug/unplug them about 10 times in your Macbook. This should be enough to reset the pin and get it working again. Also, check for any debris that could be inside - a nasty lint bunny may be hiding inside causing some wreckage (heck, I've even seen wood inside of them). I know you said you cleaned the jack with a toothpick, but do this as well since a toothpick may not always reset the pin.\nShould that not correct the issue, it may be an issue deeper with the computer. Since you already went through and reinstalled the OS, I'd say your next step would either be running Apple Diagnostic or Applecare service done on the laptop.\n", "Q: Why iMessage generate a lot of Encryption and Signing keys? First of all I don`t use iMessage. I log out of iMessage on my iDevices.\nToday I took a look of my login Keychain Access and there were 366 items. All of them were iMessage Encryption Key and iMessage Signing Key.\n\nI delete it, reboot my Mac and open Keychain Access again. In the reboot 8 keys (see screenshot) were create. Is this behaviour normal?\n\nA: There is no problem in deleting those. Just close your messages app, remove all of those from keychain and reboot your mac. It will create a fresh pair for use.\nPS: Log in and use it! It is one of the most secure IM services in the world, works seamlessly and allows you to send SMS from your mac.\n\nA: That's not abnormal. The system makes these and there's not much detail Keychain Assistant will show so it's a bit difficult to know which is used where.\nAlso, iMessages establishes a different key for each device you sign in to. The four key pairs you have could be one Mac, one iPad, one iPhone one and one watch. \nI wouldn't worry about it - they are so small, deleting them seems more risky than the benefit of clearing out \"old\" ones.\n", "Q: iTerm2 does not show username, machine name, time On my new mac machine, I could not do autocomplete for Git when I hit Tab.\nSo I thought to modify the terminal and found certain things on this link.\nI may have messed when I installed iTerm2, Oh-My-ZSH, and Solarised Dark.

There are numerous tutorials on how to set up your PROMPT variable (I use a modified version of this one). Since you're using Oh-my-zsh, try looking through the themes page. There are a variety of styles available (I began with the af-magic prompt).

So I wonder if I can use 2 external monitors on my Late 2009 21,5 iMac?\nI currently use 1 external monitor and it works great but I now want to sell it and use 2 external monitors but there is only one thunderbolt display output.\nIs there a thunderbolt display adapter that has 2 HDMI's or 2 VGA outputs that would work for my device? Please, send links if you find one that works.\n\nA: The late 2009 iMac uses Mini DisplayPort and not Thunderbolt, although they appear similar and share the same connector. The mDP technology included on the 2009 iMac does not support multiple displays.\nIn short, no. You will only be able to actually drive one monitor from the iMac, barring using a splitter. Such devices do exist but may not be able to provide you with a full dual-desktop experience (such as mirroring only, lower resolution, maximum display size limits, etc).\nSource on Specs\n", "Q: Make display in yosemite / el capitan look like Mavericks Ever since Yosemite came out, I have not been able to look at my screen for more than 10 minutes without it causing me a headache. I was hoping that this would be resolved with El Capitan, but that wasn't the case either.\nIs there a user guide or software patch out there to make the system brightness / contrast / white point settings look like they did in Mavericks? The reason I have to be using El Capitan, is that the latest Xcode doesn't work with Mavericks.\nThanks much.\n\nA: I though initially you meant you wanted the old skeuomorphic UI back… but you just mean that the display has changed or lost its colour profile. There should be no automatic change in your colour settings between Mavericks & Yosemite or El Capitan, so the first thing I'd check is whether your correct profile is still present & active.\nCheck the profile exists & is active in System Prefs > Displays > Color\nIf not, or if you can't quickly find one that suits you, then hit the Calibrate… button & attempt to recalibrate manually. It will talk you through the process quite comprehensively, but it isn't a hugely accurate process - sometimes going through it a couple of times you get a better result.\nMore accurate calibration, of course, would require a hardware colorimeter, which would probably be a different question. I put a couple of budget recommendations at the end of this answer - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/185936/85275\n\nA: I'm using Mac OS Sierra and i have the same problem. But, my eyes are now much more relaxed. I've stared at the screen for an hour without any problem. What I did are: \n\n\n*\n\n*I changed the Display Profile to \"ROMM RGB: ISO 22028-2:2013\"\n\n*Under the Night Shift tab of Display dialog, I changed the Color Temperature to warmer, may be at 40%. \n\n", "Q: Minimum volume is too loud when using Plantronics Bluetooth headphone I have this problem using an iPhone 6 or iPhone 5s with either of two sets of wireless headphones - Plantronics Backbeat Pro and Plantronics Backbeat Sense.\nThe volume over bluetooth is much higher for the same number of volume bars compared to wired, to the point where I'm severely lacking accuracy at the low volume end. 1 bar is muted, 2 bars is too loud for when listening in quiet environments. When wired the volume range is perfect.\nVolume cap doesn't fix this. Analog control of the volume in the popup control center is not enough.\nWithin iOS, EQ is off, volume limit is on (EU limit) Sound check off.\nHow can I fix this? \nFurther info:\nI've tried various manoeuvres with pairing, un-pairing, updating firmware, pairing to different devices, and back again. I don't have a non-apple device to compare with, but the same behaviour occurs with two different iPhones and the two different headsets as described. Plantronics support struggled to see how this was a problem, but acknowledged the discrepancy between wired and wireless volume ranges. I had a similar problem with a pair of V-moda crossfade wireless headphones. \nI'm not sure if this is a apple or bluetooth issue (i.e. 'profile' problem) or a hardware issue i.e. the gain is just too high. \nI've found that this issue is head-phone specific, perhaps brand-specific or in all likelihood, bluetooth implementation specific. Of the few others I've since tried I found that Bose wireless headphones to not have this issue. However, other problems with distortion sometimes occurred instead!\n\nA: The music settings don't seem to work for Spotify or other streaming apps. Many of them have built in equalizers to perform essentially the same function. Within Spotify, navigate to the settings menu. Under Playback, you can set up a custom equalizer. Lower all of the settings equally to decrease the base volume.\n\nA: Have experienced the same issue when playing music over bluetooth from an iPhone. However with the Plantronics Backbeat Pro headphones I've found that the \"OpenMic\" function can be used to reduce the headphone volume to a certain extent:\n\n\n*\n\n*The microphone button on the base of the right earphone turns on \"OpenMic\" which reduces the music volume in order to hear noise from the surroundings.\n\n*With \"OpenMic\" activated, the volume dial on the headphones controls the microphone volume, this can be turned down to silent so that you only hear your music, but at a lower volume.\n\n\nNot an ideal solution and likely specific to Plantronics headphones, but I find this useful for reducing the volume in quiet environments.\n\nA: This question has an open bounty and can't be closed right now as a duplicate... but there's duplicate question+answers, which probably would be the main reference, and the current question could be closed. \nAnyways, I have given the extended reply there. Just to summarize in your context:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's no easy way to do this by standard means of iOS (current fresh iOS v.9.3.1), without \"jailbreaking\" and intruding to the inner-workings of iOS.\n\n*As soon as you are using wireless headset, the case which explains the solution caused by higher/lower impedance - can't be applied to you.\n\n*BT-headsets, your case: Headset controls the volume level in \"electronic-way\", so it totally dependent on implementation of headsets and is dependent from manufacturer to manufacturer. The minimum volume would vary seriously depending on the model of BT-headset.\n\n\nI might propose to buy external Bluetooth adapter, which will get analogue signal, convert it to digital over BT, and it will have different settings for the volume range. I understand, that this approach is not easy to use and has its drawbacks, so I'd not recommend to go this way, unless you are really annoyed. \nTheoretically, you may play a bit with EQ settings in your iPhone (Settings -> Music -> Playback section), this might soften a bit the sound, but it barely affects the minimum volume level, it will just create the different perception, a bit milder sound.\n\nA: Is sound check enabled? That may help control some songs on the louder side. Also, you can set volume restrictions in the Music Settings.\n", "Q: Reassociating QuickLook file associations Today I noticed the QuickLook feature stopped displaying .jpg, .png, and .pdf file previews.

I would like to record a camera video on my iPad, but I do not want to use the internal microphone.\nI have a USB audio interface connected with the Camera Connection Kit, and the interface works flawlessly in audio apps. I can record multichannel audio no problem. iOS sets the audio interface as default audio device, so it's usually plug in & record, easy.\nBut the iOS camera app doesn't seem to work with the audio interface - it records silence when the audio interface is connected.\nI want to record the video from the camera, and audio from the audio interface inputs.\nAnyone found a way to do this with either a built-in or a free app?\nThanks!\n\nA: On your iOS device, launch Camera App. Select the desired recording setting (eg.

Your camera connection kit should already be plugged in, but you should only plug the audio interface usb lead into it once the camera app is running.\nRecord. It will take in whatever is on channels 1 and 2 and record with your video stream.\nNOTE: If you either close the Camera App, power down the iOS device, iOS device goes to sleep or you disconnect your interface - you will need to repeat the above procedure to capture again.\nOther issue, these is NO INDICATION you are recording audio from the external interface - so you may want to test the procedure a few times to make sure you know it works for you so you can reproduce exactly in a real situation.\n\nA: Agree with previous answer, tested on IOS 10.3.2 iPhone SE with Zoom H5 as audio device.\nMUST run built-in camera app first and select video mode.

Unplugging H5 though did, then you have kill camera app and restart H5 to re-establish audio feed from H5.\nAs above, there is still no indication of audio source in use.  Prove your process before using for real.\n\nA: I added to the answer, to stress that the sequnce of plugging in is important, “Your camera connection kit should already be plugged in, but you should only plug the audio interface usb lead into it once the camera app is running.“\nHowever, today I’ve discovered that the camera app doesn’t reliably connect to the external audio interface, whatever sequence I connect devices in. Unfortunately, as someone else noted, you get no indication of whether the external audio is being recorded, until you play back your video. Even doing a test run isn’t a guarantee that the audio will record successfully the next time.\nThis must be a bug in the camera app, because \nI get rock-solid audio with other apps like Auria Pro and Apple’s Voice Memo.\nFor the record, I was using a 2018 iPad Pro, running iOS 13.4, with a Behringer UMC404HD and Apple’s USB3 Connection Kit.\n\nA: I have a MOTU 8pre-es audio interface, using it with an iPhone 8. It can operate into a computer with either ethernet, USB or thunderbolt. But it apparently can't be connected to a computer with any of those while using it to feed into an iOS device. I can use a computer or iOS device to control its input, output and other settings, but only thru wifi. I need to freshly boot the interface and then connect it the iOS device via camera connector and USB, as described in previous posts. I'd hoped to be able to record the multitrack audio simultaneously to a DAW in the MacBook Pro, but at this point, that doesn't appear possible. \n", "Q: How do I automatically enable Personal Hotspot when my Bluetooth device is in range? (Similar to Tasker for Android) I use a spare smartphone with no SIM card as a navigation tool in my car.\nThis works fine with offline maps, but I can't use things like Waze. I also have an iPhone which I carry around with me, which does have a SIM card.\nI wanted to know if there was a way to have the iPhone automatically start its Personal Hotspot tethering when it sees the other phone is in range via Bluetooth.\nThis would allow data access to the SIM-free smartphone only while I was in my car, which would be a perfect solution similar to what the Tasker app on Android can do. Perhaps something like the Workflow app would help?\n\nA: There's a way to do this if you're jailbroken with tweak called Activator by Ryan Petrich, and unfortunately it's the only solution because regular App Store apps aren't allowed to access settings like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Personal Hotspot (even Workflow cannot access them).\nIf you happen to be jailbroken, the way to do this with Activator is to go Settings > Bluetooth > On then Settings > Activator > Anywhere > Bluetooth Devices > Connected to [your Bluetooth device] and assign it to Switches > Hotspot. You might also want to assign the Disconnected from [your Bluetooth device] event to the same action, so when you connect Bluetooth, your hotspot turns on, and when you disconnect Bluetooth, your hotspot turns off. If Switches > Hotspot doesn't appear in the list of available assignments, then you'll also need to install Flipswitch by the same author.\nFor use on iOS 9 and 10, see Doron Gold's comment below on how to set it up.\n\nA: This is not possible in vanilla iOS.\nEDIT: Here's a Stack Overflow question that proves that there is no API for it: link\nIf there is no API, unless Apple provides the functionality it can't happen. And Apple does not provide any method of doing this as far as I can tell.\n", "Q: How can I connect my iPhone 6s Plus to my stereo? I understand that Apple's iPhone Lightning Dock has a headphone socket that I can use:\n\nConnect the dock to powered speakers or a stereo using a 3.5mm cable (sold separately) to play music and podcasts from your iPhone\n\nI actually have a similar (3rd-party) dock that I used with an iPhone 4s. However, (a) that obviously has an old-style 20-pin connector, and (b) the sound quality was poor.\nClearly Apple's new dock would have the right connector, and hopefully the sound quality would be better, but I worry about the negative reviews of that dock, which imply that the stress on the connector can cause the phone's lightning socket to deteriorate and eventually fail. \nI don't care about having a \"stand\" for the phone, and I don't really care that much about charging... is there a cable-based solution I could use? (In other words, something where I just plug in a cable rather than putting the phone in a wobbly stand).\nOr, is a wireless more appropriate? I see that there are Bluetooth receivers out there that seem to be designed to do this, but again there are a lot of negative reviews, mostly about the reliability of the Bluetooth connection. The only device I found that got a lot of positive reviews was the Arcam rMini Blink, and that's quite expensive.\nDon't Apple offer something in this space? (Not that it'd be less expensive!).\n\nA: I've done it 4 different ways (from lowest to highest cost). Sound quality is mostly dependent on the quality of the audio file on the iPhone and the quality of the stereo. The quality degradation due to any of these 4 connection mechanisms seems relatively low - unless you're an audiophile or Neill Young. ;-)\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect iPhone headphone output to stereo auxiliary input with an appropriate adapter cable (mini-stereo jack ==> what ever your stereo accepts e.g. RCA). Important: Run iPhone output volume only around 50% to avoid input distortion at stereo. \n\n*Get bluetooth receiving device (I've had good luck with one from Philips bad luck with some generic chinese stuff), which connects to the stereo input. Then connect with bluetooth to that device. In my experience bluetooth worked rather well when the iPhone was stationary reasonably close to the bluetooth device. Moving around with iPhone in pocket while on Bluetooth connection could cause audio dropout grief in some cases. \n\n*Use an Airport Express as wifi or wired network participant (e.g. as a wifi extender) on your regular home wifi, and connect the audio output from that to the stereo input. Then use Airplay to send the iPhone audio to the Airport Express. Moving around with iPhone in pocket seems to be more tolerant than bluetooth based connection. \n\n*Use an Apple TV as wired or wifi participant on your home network. However to the best of my knowledge the Apple TV only outputs digital audio (HDMI or optical SPDIF on 2nd or 3rd gen Apple TV), so either the stereo has to have inputs for HDMI or optical SPDIF or one needs an additional converter box.  And then use Airplay to send the iPhone audio to the Apple TV. Moving around with iPhone in pocket is equally tolerant as with Airport Express, since both use iPhone wifi. \n\nA: You can use a suitable cable to wire the headphone jack into your stereo.  Note that the input in the stereo must accept headphone levels or it will not sound well.\nAirplay may, however, be a better approach depending on how you prefer to do it.\nYou need Wifi and the Airplay device connected to the stereo.  \nThe AppleTV is certainly capable of doing it with the sound of what is shown on the HDMI-cable, and may be able to do it just with sound (I have not tried).  This is an standard optical cable.\nAirport Express devices can also be used for this if set up to connect to the Wifi (or cabled).  I have successfully used a 1st generation Airport Express device for this, where the headphone jack supports both a normal or an optical cable.\n\nA: Apple's dock is their only entry in the iPhone to Stereo hardware game.\nYou could start with whatever metal cable you like and plug that into the headphone jack and plug the lightning cable into a charger (if that is one of your requirements).\nFrom the comments and text - the low quality is due to a bad cable or the inability of the amplifier to take the signal from line level / 50% volume and not a limitation of the iPhone in almost all cases.\nYou'd need to get a custom DAC for the iPhone for critical audiophile needs if you have the source material in a high quality and high-bitrate encoding. For casual use - modest cables and non-maxed out volume should let the iPhone send near digital quality sound to consumer stereos over a short metal cable.\n", "Q: Recover Notes from TimeMachine I have deleted an information in a note I need to recover. The note is purely local (not synched in the cloud or on any other device).\nI'm using Mac OS X El Capitan V10.11.3 and the Apple app \"Notes\" Version 4.2 (549.10.1).\nI do have several Time Machine backups available.\nI did find several solutions on the internet but they seems to apply to older version of the Notes app.\nIf I open the Time Machine backup and go to:\n/Users/<my username>/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The subfolder \"Notes\" has an old databases \"NotesV6.storedata\" but not modified since my upgrade to El Capitan so it's an old version.\n\n\nNote that this database could contain the info I'm looking for so a solution to my immediate issue may be to find a way to read it...\n\n\n*\n\n*The subfolder CoreData/ExternalRecords/NotesV4/6003A0A6.....401 contains many subfolders, among them the ICNote/_records/O/ that seems to contains the notes, but this is all 0 byte size files that, when looked at in finder contains the current version of my notes, so it seems they are some kind of pointer to the notes location rather than a backup of the notes. (In the console they are not symlinks.)\n\n\nDoing a grep with keyword that are presents in the notes did not help.\nSo the question is: which files should I restore from Time Machine to recover my notes?\n\nA: Empirically, it seems that the 3 items in\n~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/\nare updated as a Note is changed, whereas those in\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/\nare only updated periodically [I cannot find how to trigger those to update, I thought making a new Note may do it, but it appears not.]\nMy research was actually aided by my old faithful - EasyFind (freeware, no affiliation) - which I set hunting for a keyword in one of my existing Notes. It took quite some time, but found it in the end.\n", "Q: Why is Time Machine backing up to .sparsebundle file? In the past, I had used only an external hard drive for my backups. It worked great, and it backed up to folders, in a way that I could go to individual files in the backup. I decided that since I was on a laptop, I should be backing up wirelessly (so I don't have to keep it plugged in). After my first painfully long backup to my old Time Capsule, I realized the file was not a folder but a .sparsebundle file. What is this? How do I change it back?\n\nA: A Sparsebundle is a disk image format introduced by Apple in OSX 10.5 as a method of effectively using space for backups on a disk. This is an expandable/retractable disk that will only take up as much room as the data inside of it up to a predefined limit (in the case of TM, the size of the partition). This also allows for incremental backups in which parts of a file can be layered on top of one another so you can perform a revisional history instead of replacing a file with a full new copy each and every time.\nSource\nAs for why, Apple reserves the right to have their proprietary backup tool save data under whichever format they think would work best. As such, they developed their own. At this time, there is no way to make Time Machine use a different format - you will have to use a different backup utility to achieve that.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure you can't, and you wouldn't want to. The OS only bypasses the bundle for locally attached backup destinations.\n\n\n*\n\n*Direct attached storage (DAS) uses the HFS+ filesystem and /Backups.backupsdb folder structure\n\n*Network attached storage (NAS) uses the sparse bundle format to embed a HFS+ filesystem on whatever filesystem that the NAS uses natively.\n\n\nTime Machine's backup format plays some very interesting tricks with the Mac OS Extended filesystem that aren't really possible over a generic network storage volume. It's also optimized to minimize network traffic when files change. This speeds both backup, browsing and restore operations and minimizes the volume of data file changes on the NAS for small changes on the source disk.\nIn order to get TM to work over a network connection, it stores a disk image (in sparse bundle format) on the network server, and mounts that locally on the client. Since it's mounted locally, the client has full access to the filesystem and can play all of the necessary tricks.\nSo, without the .sparsebundle, you wouldn't be able to back up over the network since it optimizes the amount of data sent to the Time Capsule when a file changes as well as reduces the load on the Time Capsule to handle easier IO to the disk.\nYou can still mount the sparse bundle image on any OS X machine and navigate to files. The only drawback might be if you are using an OS that doesn't have a filesystem plug in for sparse bundle storage format.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure Time Machine uses the .sparsebundle format only if you encrypt your backup.\nYou have two options if you want to be able to browse the contents of your backups. The first is to deselect the option to encrypt your backups. The second option, which I would recommend is to just double click on the .sparsebundle and let OS X mount it as a drive (you'll need the encryption password). That little bit of effort will get you what you want—you'll be able to browse the backups—without sacrificing security. \n\nA: I formatted an external USB drive as APFS Encrypted format, then I ran Timemachine backup.  This produced a single sparse bundle file image, which I didn't like.\nI went back, reformatted the same USB drive as Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled, Encrypted) format and reran the Timemachine backup.  This produced the Backups.backupdb browsable folder structure that I prefer.\n\nA: This was hinted at in some other comments, but .sparsebundles can be mounted like a normal .dmg file, allowing you to browse the backups the way you used to. (Works on my macOS Catalina system.)\n", "Q: How do I set Outlook as the default mail option in Yosemite? Mail merge is greyed out, in MS Word so I'm guessing that it needs to talk directly to Outlook instead of Apple's mail app. I read somewhere that Outlook as to be set as the default in Mail.app, but I can't find how to do that.\nIs this possible to get Word's Mail Merge working on OS X?\n\nA: You can set Outlook as the default mail app following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the “Mail” application in OS X, note that you have to open the Mail app even if you’re wanting to use another mail client like Outlook.\n\n*Pull down the “Mail” menu and choose “Preferences”.\n\n*Go to the “General” tab. \n\n*Look for “Default email reader” and click on the menu to pull down other mail app options. If the mail app you want to use is not shown in this list choose “Select” to browse the /Applications/ folder and select one manually.\n\n", "Q: My Mac is getting really slow, what should I do? I bought a Mac (13\", early 2011) almost 5 years ago. When I first got it, it was running under OS X 10.7 and it was pretty fast. I've being upgrading it ever since and it's now running under Mac OS X 10.11.\nI guess it didn't totally survive the upgrades because, today, there's a lot of bugs, freezes, lags, \"spinning beach ball\" appearing,... for example, when I write something on a normal program/editor, the cursor freezes for a few seconds, then catches up to what I'm writting.\nAs you can guess, that's really annoying! I've been thinkning about upgrading the hardware but I don't know what to do: should I change the RAM to 8 GB - 1 333 MHz (currently my computer has 4 GB - 1 333 MHz)? Or should I upgrade to an SSD (which is pretty expensive and difficult to install)?\nThank you very much.\n\nA: So it's been a long time since I originally posted this question. I didn't update my RAM (although I'm thinking about it), but I changed my hard drive to a Samsung SSD.\nThe change is radical. The computer is not slow at all anymore. There are no more \"freezing\", and it takes exactly 15 seconds to boot, instead of something like 1 minute or more. Any application opens almost instantly. It seems like I just bought my mac.\nIf you want to speed up your mac (or PC), you should definitely buy an SSD. I also did a clean install and copied whatever I needed from a backup.\nAs I said, I'm thinking of adding some RAM. I currently have 4GB but I want to buy 8GB or 16GB. I'll let you know then, if it works or not.\nPlease upvote this answer so that everyone can see it !\n--- 2019 EDIT ---\nHello again, I posted this answer about 3 years ago.\nI recently had to change my RAM so I now have 8 Gb of RAM instead of 4 (my old RAM that came with the Mac died). To be perfectly honest, the change wasn't radical this time but I do feel like the computer isn't as slow when I use multiple applications at once.\nI'm now studying computer science so I often have lots of programs opened at the same time and I really don't think I could have done this with 4 Gb. Sometimes I'm forced to run a Windows VM and, although it's far from being optimal, I can still do it with just a few lags from time to time.\nA very important point to note, I'm still running Mac OS 10.11 ! So under a more recent version of MacOS, my computer would probably not be as fast. But to be fair, I have a friend who was using a 2012 MBP (mine is from 2011) on the latest version of MacOS and when he changed to an SSD, he told me that, just like me, he felt his computer was brand new.\nSo if you have a 2011 (or even older !) Mac that is getting old, instead of buying a new one you could simply upgrade your storage to an SSD and buy more RAM. Chances are you'll feel your computer is brand new.\n\nA: I report as answer my comments above.\nAssuming you are using a HDD, I guess an upgrade to SSD will increase a lot the speed of your Mac.\nIf you buy a new SSD and start instilling and saving only the things you need (without restore from a previous backup with Time Machine) the speed will increase a lot!! Naturally assuming you don't have any problem in the hardware!\nI recently install a Samsung SSD EVO series and it works perfectly in my MacBook Pro Mid-2010. If you prefer expend a little more you can go through the PRO series. \nBefore upgrade also the RAM, I think you should first try to see how the performance increase with the new SSD and then evaluate if it worth to buy also more RAM memory.\n\nA: I'm going on the assumption that you have a MacBook Pro Early 2011. There were no MacBook Airs with that designation and MacBooks stopped production in 2010 and resumed again in 2015.\nIt would still be helpful to know what specific model you had, however.\nIt came (usually) with 4GB of RAM, 320GB (spinning, 5400 RPM) hard drive. That's not anywhere \"fast\" by today's standards.\nHere's what I recommend:\nMax Out Your Memory.\nThe max you can put on this is 16GB of RAM.  You can use any of these 16GB kits (2 8GB SODIMMS) or go for this one by Crucial.  I have used this brand in 2 iMacs and 4 MacBook Pros with zero issues.  The iMac I am typing on right now has 32 GB and I can't tell you how much a difference it has made over the 4GB that came with it.\nUpgrade to an SSD\nYour 5400 RPM drive is slow.  They picked 5400 RPM over the faster 7200 RPM for one reason and one reason only - battery life.  Adding an SSD will not only give you tremendous speed, but also longer battery life.  I upgraded my iMac just two weeks ago from the 1TB Fusion drive to a 1TB SSD and this thing not only runs quieter, but faster as well.\nI am partial to Samsung as they have never failed me in the past.  This is the Samsung 1TB SSD I purchased to replace my failing fusion drive \nSwap out your DVD Drive for Another HDD (Optional)\nWhile you are replacing drives, if your old 5400 Drive is still good, you can use it as a second drive for data, music, pictures;  create your own Fusion Drive or best yet, have an internal drive for super fast Time Machine Backups.\nThere is a universal optical bay hard drive conversion kit that you can use to install another HDD/SSD in its place.  I have used two of these already, one in a MacBook Pro and the other in a Dell Optiplex 745.  At under $15, it is a super cheap option to add.\nHow to Install all this \"Stuff\"\nTo do any of these upgrades, you will need to remove the back cover.  It's only 10 Phillips screws:\n\nOnce you're in, you can replace the drive:\n\nor the memory:\n\nand even install the optical bay kit:\n\nYou can get tutorials on how to do this from http://ifixit.com which is where I sourced all these great photos.\nLast but not Least\nYou will want to make a Time Machine backup of your computer.  It will be the easiest way to transfer all your files and settings.  Personally, I like to start with a nice clean slate and just move over data.  Applications I like to re-install.  I have found that my computers are much more stable when doing clean installs rather than restoration of previously installed software.\n", "Q: How do I transfer from my computers icloud to my 6S iphone? I just bought a new 6S iPhone. How do I transfer all my old 6 iPhone to my new phone.  I have loaded icloud onto my computer and think I backed up my old phones data.  Now.... how do transfer from icloud on my computer to my new 6Siphone?\n\nA: After you have all neccessary data on iCloud, then put your SIM card into your new iPhone and turn it on. Begin setting your iPhone up. You will be prompted to select a Wi-Fi network and language. Then, choose Restore from iCloud backup. Use your Apple ID to sign into your iCloud account. Click Next, and agree to the Terms and Conditions. Choose your most recent backup from the list of options and enter your iCloud password if you are prompted to do so.\nhttps://macback.us/tutorials/how-to-transfer-data-from-iphone-5-5s-to-iphone-6-6s/\n\nA: You cannot transfer any iCloud data from a computer to a phone. You have not stored any iCloud data on your computer. iCloud data is stored in the location the name implies--the cloud. Have you been regularly  backing up to iCloud? Go to Settings->iCloud->Backup and see when the last backup was. Then, on the new iPhone, select restore from iCloud backup, and it will automatically download all your settings, wallpapers, photos, and apps from the previous phone. Depending on your WiFi, this may take some time. You may view this article for more detailed information. \n\nA: The quickest way to bring all your data to your new phone would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*start iTunes\n\n*connect your old phone using a USB cable\n\n*do a backup on your computer\n\n*unconnected the old phone\n\n*connect the new phone using a USB cable\n\n*restore from backup\n\n\nEven if you have a iCloud backup this will normally be faster.

The window also shows the name of the screen \"SMB2230\" on my Macbook and when I plug-in the HDMI, the screen flickers for a second and dock (on the right) disappears from the built-in display and I can move my mouse to the right and it also disappears but the external monitor shows the message \"Check signal cable\". I have tried restarting it as well but no luck. \nNote: The screen is working with other laptops running Windows and Ubuntu with the same connector and the same VGA cable. \nPlease don't tell me that I have to use MiniDisplay port/wire from Apple. \nhere is an image\n\n\nA: Try a PRAM and SMC reset. Usually helps.\nAlso try replugging in the connectors on both ends \n\nA: The only way I was able to get this to work was to put a powered HDMI splitter in between the MacBook and HDMI to VGA adapter.\nMacBook > HDMI cable > powered splitter > HDMI to VGA adapter > VGA cable > monitor.\nSUcks, but it works.\n\nA: Look at my answer on this forum, hope it will work for you! https://discussions.apple.com/message/30126959#30126959\n", "Q: Remove characters preceding the second underscore in file names I have a bunch of files and I would like to remove all characters preceding the second underscore in the file names.

I have a lot of external hard disk drives, mainly formatted in NTFS since I have both Windows and Mac. I know iDefrag, but it only works with HFS hard drives and I was wondering if there are any utilities to defrag NTFS drives.\n\nA: In short, no, I don't know of a way to do this other than booting into Windows.\nThat being said, a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why do you feel that the drive needs to be defragmented? Modern NTFS does a fairly decent job of preventing itself from getting too fragmented, at least when running under Windows 7+.\n\n*If you're sharing these disks with Windows machines, any reason you can't defrag when connected to those platforms?\n\n*The NTFS implementation on OSX has never really been extremely robust. While I'm not sure if the reason is solely due to how to handle ACLs (file permissions), it is worth pointing out that NTFS write capability isn't enabled by default.\n\n*If your primary machine is OSX, then you're probably best served using HFS+ as your file system. NTFS should be \"SneakerNet\" with the implication that it probably spends a significant amount of its time on a Windows machine anyway.\n\n\nProbably #3 is the strongest point here, but at least this list is worth some thought?\n\nA: Not sure if this works for NTFS but you can defrag it without a dedicated defrag tool but you will be needing a clone app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone your NTFS hard drive using clone software to another hard drive\n\n*Format the NTFS hard drive completely\n\n*Restore clone copy back to the formatted hard drive\n\n\nLogic: Formatting will erase all the fragmented data present on the NTFS disk. When clone copy is restored the OS will allocate contagious memory locations to data which will remove fragmentation. I am recommending this since it works for HFS formatted drives.\n", "Q: Can an iPhone use OS X Server's Calendar service without enabling iCloud calendars? There are iOS devices in my household which do not have iCloud calendar syncing enabled. However, I would like to have a shared calendar that is contained within my household and not replicated on the cloud (iCloud, Google or other).\nIt seems that OS X Server's calendar service allows you to have a shared calendar within your household and presumably syncs when those devices are on your home LAN/WiFi network. All well and good.\nThe question is, would you be able to use the Calendar service from OS X Server without enabling iCloud calendar syncing?\n\nA: Yes, you can add an OS X Server calendar as a separate account through Settings → Mail, Contacts, Calendars → Add Account → Other → Add OS X Server Account.\nThis is a completely separate account to your iCloud account. You can allow sync outside of your LAN by forwarding the relevant ports.\n", "Q: How do I install OpenSSL in ElCaptain if my HomeBrew it's broken? After an upgrade from 10.10 to 10.11, my rails environment was broken.\nI've removed the broken open-source projects/files and now I'm trying to install HomeBrew.\nBut I receive this message:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\ncurl: (77) SSL: can't load CA certificate file /System/Library/OpenSSL/certs/cert.pem\n\nBut to install OpenSSL, I need homebrew. So, I'm stuck.\nHow can I get around this issue?\n\nA: You can curl without SSL by removing the ‘s’ from ‘https’:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL http://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nAdditionally, you could just point a web browser to the page, http://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install and save the code to /tmp/brew.rb as a text file and then run it\nruby -e /tmp/brew.rb\n\n", "Q: iPhone 6 iOS 9 how to fix blank screen - no apps visible I'm running into a weird issue over the last couple days where I can't see any content on the iOS \"App Store\" when viewed on the device. Blank screen is visible. It seems that I can still update apps, and the updates screen has updates available.\nHow can I fix the \"blank screen\" problem with the Apple iOS App store?\nTHere's no spinner visible and the app can just sit there with no content refreshing.\nSee screenshot:\n\n\nA: Tap on any one of the toolbar buttons (Featured, Search, Updates, etc.) on the bottom of the screen rapidly 10 times. It sounds counter-intuitive, but it will refresh the App Store and should solve your problem.\n\nA: Tried all the other solutions, this one worked: I chose airplane mode, tried to open the app store, got the error message, ignored it, shut down app store, opened app store, had the no connection message, turned off airplane mode and within 30 seconds got icons and search facility back.\n\nA: The only thing that kind of works is resetting but you don't have all the pages available. (featured doesn't load).\n\nA: Have someone send you a link to an app in the appstore via SMS and then click on the link. It worked for me\n", "Q: mid-2012 Macbook Pro Retina 15\" won't recognize new adapter I recently bought a new power adapter off Amazon, and it worked with my mid-2014 MBP at work and my colleague's mid-2014 MBP, but not my mid-2012 MBP Retina 15\" (which, frustratingly, it was bought as a replacement for). The green light comes on, but doesn't switch to orange to indicate charging, nor does the machine detect it.\nIt's literally the exact same model number of the adapter that came with my machine. I figured the replacement was possibly defective, so returned it and got a replacement. Alas, it still doesn't work on my mid-2012 MBP, but does work on my partner's mid-2014 MBP. \nI've tried resetting SMC, to no avail. Even more confusing, my work power adapter charges my mid-2012 MBP fine, and is what I'm using at the moment.\nAny ideas?\nEdit: As requested, here are some photos of the sides of the new adapter.\n\n\n\nA: You have the wrong power adapter.\nThe Mid 2014 uses a 60W adapter and the Mid 2012 uses an 85W.\n\nSee this page Find the right power adapter and cord for your Mac notebook on Apples's website for details\nYou can always use a power adapter with a higher power rating on a machine that requires less, but you can't use an adapter with a lower power rating on a machine that requires more.  In other words a MBP with a 60W power requirement will work fine with an 85W adapter, but a MBP with an 85W power requirement will not work with a 60W power adapter.\nThis is the product you want.\n", "Q: How can I change an NTFS Volume UUID?

After saving the file check the size which should still be 512 Bytes.\nWrite back the superblock:\nsudo dd if=~/Desktop/superblock of=/dev/disk1s4 bs=512 count=1\n\nReboot your Mac and verify the new UUID of disk1s4.\n\nA: You can simply change UUID by partition format/erase.\n1) Format disk to Mac OS Extended using built-in Disk Utility\n2) If you need windows partition, format disk to exFAT after you have done first step (for some reason you need two steps for windows partition)\nYou can check if UUID changed by listing all UUID numbers:\nfind /Volumes -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -exec diskutil info {} \\;\n\n\nA: On an NTFS partition the UUID is approximately 3352 bytes[1] from the beginning of the MFT, to find the offset of the MFT it is necessary to read the 8 bytes which start from the 48 byte of the beginning of the partition, These 8 bytes once converted will give the offset of the sector where the MFT begins. To get the offset of the MFT the 8 bytes converted must be multiplied by the number of bytes per sector (512) and the number of sectors per clusters (8) (8 and 512 are the default values ​​for an NTFS partition). \nFor example, the 8 bytes starting at the 48th (in reading it is two characters per one byte) may be 0x698c670000000000 which will have to be inverted 0x0000000000678c69 and converted to decimal 6786153. Then apply the formula (6786153 * 8 * 512) or (6786153 * 4096 ) = 27796082688 (offset of the MFT) + 3352 (UUID offset) = 27796086040. so in the partition if we move to byte 27796086040 we will find the UUID of the partition on 16 bytes which will have to be converted into Hexadecimal and inverted for the first 8.\nThere is not much interest in modifying the UUID of an NTFS partition, Microsoft apparently does not use it, Mac OS X displays the UUIDs of the partitions. There is not much comment on the UUID of NTFS partitions. I've created an AppleScript[2] to read the NTFS or HFS UUIDs. The only UUIDs that I modify are those of the HFS, to start with the choice of the UUID.\n[1]: +3352 this is for a physical NTFS partition, for a partition of a VHD it's +3320)\n[2]: AppleScript to read UUID from an NTFS partition. All sudo commands are to be completed for your name and password, otherwise try removing the sudo. I do not advise you to modify the UUID, there is no information on their use.\nI left the inversion of the bytes in a very rudimentary way.**\nset hdd to {}\nset dmg to do shell script \"sudo ls /dev/disk**s** \" & \" | sed -e 's#[[:space:]]*$##;s#\\\\/dev\\\\/##;/^$/d'\" user name \"Your_Name\" password \"Your_Password\" with administrator privileges\nset doun to \"\"\nset dor to \"\"\nset uuidd to \"\"\nset uuidd to {}\n\nset hfsountfs to \"\"\nset theVol1 to \"\"\nset theVol to \"\"\nset vhd to \"\"\nset leplus to 0\nset levhd to \"\"\nset hd to {}\nset _Result to the paragraphs of dmg\nset n to 0\nset n to count _Result\nset j to 1\ndo shell script \"echo \" & n\n\nrepeat with i from 1 to n\n    set end of hdd to item i of _Result\n\nend repeat\n\nset theVolumeTemp to (choose from list hdd with prompt \"Choisissez le Volume (partition) NTFS :\" with empty selection allowed)\nif theVolumeTemp is not false then\n\n    set theVolumeTemp to do shell script \"echo \" & theVolumeTemp\n    set theVol to \"/dev/\" & theVolumeTemp\n    set theVol1 to theVol\n    set theVol to do shell script \"echo \" & theVol & \" | xxd -p | sed 's#0a##' | xxd -r -p \"\n    try\n        set vhd to do shell script \"diskutil info \" & theVol & \" | grep 'Disk Image' \"\n    end try\n    try\n\n        set uuidd to do shell script \"diskutil unmount \" & theVol\n    end try\n    set uuidd to do shell script \"sudo dd if=\" & theVol & \" iseek=48 bs=1 count=8  | xxd -p \" user name \"Your_Name\" password \"Your_Password\" with administrator privileges\n\n    set theVol to do shell script \"echo \" & uuidd\n    set n to 0\n    set n to count uuidd\n    do shell script \"echo \" & n\n\n    repeat with i from 1 to 8\n        set les2 to (item (n -

Windows was unable to mount both drives, due to the conflict, but using the windows cmd prompt elevated to Administrator privileges, I was able to view and change the UUID of the unmounted drive to make it different from the original as described here:\nhttp://support.altaro.com/customer/portal/articles/1115503-how-can-i-change-the-disk-id-of-a-drive-\nCarbonCopyCloner may then work for you.\nIf not, you can boot to OS X, and use Disk Utility to do it.\nSelect the backup drive and choose the Restore command. It will let you select your source volume and copy it to the clone volume.\nIf that doesn't work because it's an NTFS volume, you need Paragon's NTFS for Mac app, which I purchased. It allows for both reads and writes of NTFS from within OS X, and I find it indispensable. However, it comes with a 7-day free trial, and the trial version should work for you. Install it, and then Disk Utility will be able to perform the operation.\nAnother thing I've found handy with the Paragon NTFS for Mac utility is that it will allow you to add your cloned drive to the Preferences Startup Disk menu, not to mention also adding a Windows Repair disk to the Startup Preferences if you have one.\n", "Q: Yosemite: Corrupt quick look images Ever since my transition to 10.10.5 Yosemite, quick look keeps corrupting the preview images every now and then.

I am willing to take all risks, I don't care if it get's super slow or even bricks my device while trying.\nPS. I understand why the simulator doesn't have app store and why I can't run pre compiled apps on the simulator. As the simulator is x86 and the devices are on ARM processors.

On the other hand, when a new message is received and labeled in Gmail, this message is saved in a folder in Mail, having the same name of the label. Actually labels in Gmail become folders in OS X Mail. You can see those folders in the sidebar of the app. Obviously, it's not like having labels, I think that this is very annoying.\nOne thing you can do, to give your incoming messages a sort of \"label\" in Mail as well is to define a rule for your incoming emails. You may want to highlight with the same color all the mails belonging to the same account. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preferences > Rules > Add rule\n\n*Set the rule you like. For example: if To your-email-account, then Set Color of the Message.\n\n*Click OK, then apply the rule to your previous emails, if you like, and it's done.\n\n\nOf course is not like having labels, but at least you can recognise emails coming from different accounts by their background color. \nHope this can be useful ;-)\n\nA: You can label the mailboxes in iOS.

I normally have British and Greek on the menu bar dropdown (Greek for easy access to greek characters for scientific symbols now and then). Both disappeared recently to be replaced by USA.  I also have muscle memory for £ and # as alternative '3' characters.\nIt was easily fixed by opening keyboard preferences and using + to add British and Greek and - to remove USA.\n\nA: I went into Input Source, then I deleted the ABC Extended option leaving just the British option, and that solved it straight away.\n", "Q: Why does F3 not work as Find Next in Chrome? I've already set up in system preferences, checkbox Use all F1, F2,... as standard function (checked on).\nBut still after  Cmd ⌘   F   on Chrome, pressing  F3   won't do anything... I expected Find Next would go.... only way is pressing  Cmd ⌘   G  \nany chance?\n\nA: F3, like the previous poster said, is a Windows convention.  Cmd+F is how all applications within OS X do a \"Find\".  However, you can re-map your Windows favorites to OS X with no problem.\nIf you want to make F3 = \"Find Next\" in Google Chrome, you can set that up yourself.\nGo to [System Preferences] --> [Keyboard] --> [Shortcuts]\n\nSelect App Shortcuts and then click the \"plus sign\" to add a new one.  You will get a dialog box like the one below\n\nSelect your Application that you want to create the shortcut for, in this case Google Chrome.\nNow, here is the most important part:  Type the name of the menu command exactly as you see it.  Go to the menu bar at the top of the screen and select the command from one of the menu drop downs.  In this case, it's \"Find Next\"\n\nEnter that into your new Shortcut and assign the key you want, in this case F3.  It should look like this:\n\nClick \"Add\" and you should see it show up as an new Shortcut.  Head over to Chrome and you will see that \"Find Next\" is now mapped to F3\n\nA: F3 for search is very much a Windows shortcut, & in fact isn't in the shortcuts list for Google Chrome on Mac at all.\n\n\nSource : Google Chrome Help\n", "Q: iOS 9 Screen Recording in El Capitan I used to record iOS devices through QuickTime, however now it's only recording audio (not sure is this linked to OS X 10.11 or iOS 9).\nHow can I fix this (without third party sofrware)?\n\n\nA: You have to choose New Movie Recording (⌥ ALT+⌘ CMD+N) instead of New Screen Recording.\n\n\nA: Here's how I would go about solving this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are running the latest versions of iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 (if not, update)\n\n*Force quit QuickTime Player and reopen it\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Restart your iOS device\n\n*Make sure that you are using an Apple-branded cable\n\n*Boot into recovery and reinstall OS X\n\n*Backup your iPhone with iTunes, erase it, and restore the backup\n\n*Clone your Mac's HD or SSD with Disk Utility onto an external HD or SSD, wipe the internal drive, reinstall OS X, and use Migration Assistant to restore the cloned external drive\n\n*Report the bugs to Apple, wait for the next updates, and hope that they fix it\n\n", "Q: Macbook freezes (keyboard, mouse, audio not working) with external hard drive I've installed some apps on external hard drive, as I don't have enough space on my macbook's drive.

However last night out of nowhere, I got the message saying my storage is almost full.\nConfused, because there was no way I used 55GB(actual storage) of space. So I headed over to my Manage Storage page, which had me even more confused.\n\nAs you can see, the apps that take up the most space are Photos, Spotify and Music. They don't even take up 10GB.. I added the Used storage by all the other apps and it does not even come close to 45GB. When I plug in my phone to my laptop, it says the storage is used by Documents & Data.\nBefore you answer my question, I am aware that Safari and Chrome take up cookies and cache. I am also aware that other apps can have similar data. Even considering all that, there is just no way I am using 52GB.\nJust what is going on?\n\nA: I had something like this on my iPad. It turned out that when I streamed (rather than download to watch later) movies and TV shows it stored the data on the device but didn't report it.\nWhat I had to do what log out of iTunes/iCloud and log back in again, this cleared all these cached movies and released the data back to me.\n\nA: There are just too many things that require physical storage. That's why Apple chose to lump a lot of things into the \"Other\" category. it's seems like your phone is filled with cached files and data. That can include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Documents & Data\n\n*Safari browsing data\n\n*Mail data\n\n*iTunes data, including files that have been streamed (which can be BIG).\n...\n\n\nDeleting data, and then restoring is a good way, but you should back up first. or it will cause data lost.\nYou said that you have many photos storage, have you checked your \"Recently deleted\" album? Maybe it takes up your storage. Since iOS 8, the pics and videos you deleted are not actually gone. If you want to make them disappeared you need to go to the \"Recently deleted\" album and delete them again. Otherwise you need to wait for 30 days they will be deleted automatically.\nIn addition, you can try to clean up cache files frequently. someone who has similar situation with you, You can also refer to this thread.\n", "Q: How to make Terminal windows persistent How can I make it so Terminal will remember the currently open windows on Quit, and reopen those windows, with all the existing text intact?\nI have two machines:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both on El Cap\n\n*Both with identical Terminal preferences, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Profiles > Window > Restore text when reopening windows [checked]\n\n*Profiles > Shell > When the shell exits [Don't close the window]\n\n\n\n*Both with identical .bash_profiles (just for LSCOLORS)\n\nOn the first machine, Terminal reopens windows exactly as I left them before Quit.\nOn the second machine, Terminal always starts with an empty bash window.  I can still press up to get previous commands.  (And the scrollbar is different on the second machine, FWIW).\nI can't figure out what's responsible for the (desired) behavior on the first machine, so I haven't been able to port it to the second machine.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: You have \"Close windows when quitting an app\" checked on the machine that does not restore the terminal windows (your second machine).\nThis setting is in System Preferences -> General not in your Terminal preferences.\nUncheck this box to get the desired behavior.  Understand however that this behavior can extend to other applications as well - it is not restricted to Terminal.app\nAs for the scroll bars, I suspect you will find that the Show Scroll Bars radio button in System Preferences -> General is not set the same on your two machines.\n", "Q: Apple keyboard remap keypad comma to dot? Is there any way to change the key mapping of the apple keyboard?\nAs programmer I find annoying there's a comma instead a dot in numeric keypad. I would remap this key to have dot ...\n\nA: based on Matías González answer:\nStep 1, Add the remapping (paste this command on your console):\nmkdir ~/Library/KeyBindings && cd ~/Library/KeyBindings && touch DefaultKeyBinding.dict && echo '{\"#,\" = (\"insertText:\", \".\");}' > DefaultKeyBinding.dict\n\nStep 2, Restart the mac\nThe # indicates the remapping is for the keypad only. More reference for that file: https://gist.github.com/trusktr/1e5e516df4e8032cbc3d\n\nA: If anyone is reading this in 2022 and using Mac OS X 12.1 (Monterey) and wants to change dot (.) to comma (,) on a number keypad, try the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal application;\n\n*Paste this code on it:\n\nhidutil property --set '\n{\"UserKeyMapping\": [\n    {\n        \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\": 0x700000063,\n        \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\": 0x700000036\n    },\n]}'\n\n\n\n*Press enter;\n\n*Enjoy it!\n\n0x700000063 means dot char .\n0x700000036 means comma char ,\n\nReference: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2450/_index.html\n\nA: The simplest solution is to create the file  DefaultKeyBinding.dict in /Users/[user]/Library/KeyBindings if it does not already exist, and add the remapping:\n{\n   \"#,\" = (\"insertText:\", \".\");\n}\n\nThen logout or restart the mac.\nThe # indicates the remapping is for the keypad only. More reference for that file: https://gist.github.com/trusktr/1e5e516df4e8032cbc3d\n\nA: One solution is Karabiner (prior to version 9.3.0, Karabiner was called KeyRemap4MacBook). It allows you to remap specific keys or change then entire keyboard layout, as described here.\nIt is a powerful keyboard remapper that can change not only the functionality of keys and key combinations, but just about everything related to how a key repeats when you hold it down. Keyboard remappings are highly customizable (although it's not a so simple process). You can change practically anything: you can search through all the options and quickly find what you're looking for, or just browse by category.  It's very powerful and usage is pretty straightforward.\nThe drawback is that keyboard remapping functions are predefined and you can just check them off. If you want to add custom remapping functions, you have to edit an XML file. When you're using a GUI application this is not exactly the ideal experience. That said, this is the only significant drawback.\n\nA: For the reverse that Panosru is looking for I believe that the correct syntax within ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict should be:\n{\n   \"#.\" = (\"insertText:\". \",\");\n}\n\nAs the comma after \"insertText\" is a separator between the command and the wanted character.\n\nA: I changed my keyboard from \"Dutch\" to \"US international - PC\" and my numpad dot works as expected. It's no longer giving me a comma.\n", "Q: How big of a HDD can a Mid 2010 Mac Pro handle? I heard somewhere that the maximum HDD size that my Mid 2010 Mac Pro can handle is 4TB.  Is this correct?

I don't know if it is going to fit your exact requirement, but it does have an excessive number of features including a magnified editing mode and color substitution.\nOtherwise, have you tried Paint.NET via Wine? It seems that only the v3.5.x version might get somewhere, but with limitations.\n\nA: Not sure, but it might be possible to install the .net framework on OS X. That's just from a quick Google search, and I don't truly understand this stuff, but take a look. I believe you can also use Wine to run it.\nEven though this isn't directed at your use case, take a look at this post about alternatives. This post also suggests alternatives, including Pixen, PikoPixel, Piskel, Aesprite, and setting up GIMP to work well with Pixel art.

Specifically, my library file is now 22GB, which, on a 120GB SSD (I'm running a MacBook Air with OS X El Capitan) is way too big.  I've been careful to select \"leave files in place\" whenever I import media into Final Cut Pro, yet the library file is still growing and growing.  Am I doing anything wrong or do I just have to offload my Final Cut Pro library to a bigger drive?\nUPDATE: I didn't realize until now that the different versions of Final Cut Pro were so different.  I'm running the latest version of Final Cut Pro X from the Mac App Store.\n\nA: Turn Off Background Rendering\nGo to Preferences -> Playback and make sure \"Render:  Background render\" is NOT checked.\nAn important caveat is that you might want a Mac that can render in real time for this to work.  If the rendering falls behind during playback you get some odd appearances.  YMMV but it's worth a try.\nAfter you turn that off, go to Delete Generated Library Files, and Delete \"All\" Render Files.  Your file will be tiny in comparison.\nIf you have Background Rendering enabled, then the render data will be generated into the fcpbundle file.  I have a project which requires under 30 MB of space, but when I had background rendering on, it was over 7GB!  The largest I saw was almost 20GB.  Obviously then if you have Time Machine on, it's going to back up this changed file EVERY TIME Time Machine runs.  That's what drove me to figure it out - my backup disk was suddenly chewing through GB.\n\nA: You are right to leave media in the original location to help save space. Beyond this setting, take a look at your Library's settings.\nManage Storage Locations\nFinal Cut Pro is likely creating proxy and optimised copies of your original media. By default, these temporary files are stored within your Final Cut Pro libraries. You can change the location of temporary files, see Final Cut Pro X: Manage storage locations.\nWhen you finish working on a project, ask Final Cut Pro to delete all associated runtime created files:\nFinal Cut Pro.app > File (menu) > Delete Generated Library Files…\n\nThis will dramatically reduce the file size of your library.\n", "Q: How do I change the icon of Emacs installed via Homebrew?

In the simplest case an icon file will usually be for application X (I think the developer can decide to use another name)\nX.app/Contents/Resources/X.icns You can then replace that file. However if the application is well written and so complies with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines there will be several icons \n\nEvery app must include several sizes of its app icon for display in the Finder, Dock, Launchpad, and elsewhere. \n\nNote that when Homebrew gets an updated version of Emacs and you update it will overwrite the change you made.\n\nA: Another way I found to do this simple change is to use image2icon, you can install with homebrew and then use any icon you want.\n\nA: nowadays you should just try this:\nbrew install emacs-mac --with-emacs-sexy-icon\n\n", "Q: Shortcut for opening an app?

From last 2-3 weeks I started noticing that my iPhone is consuming more battery than usual, around two to three times more.  When I looked at battery consumption details I found out that Safari is consuming too much battery. And this is happening consistently from last 2-3 weeks when I don't even use safari very much. As an example take a look at image attached, for 12 minutes of screen time it consumed 73% of battery. Why?\niOS version: 9.2.1\nPhone: iPhone 6\nSafari: latest available version\n\n\nA: I had this same problem for the first after updating my iPhone 6s to iOS 11. I wasn't using Safari as I use Chrome but it would consume up to 50% of my battery and I was having to charge more frequently then before.\nThe solution was to disable iCloud syncing for Safari:\nSettings → Apple ID → iCloud and turn off Safari.\nMy phone is now behaving 'normally'.\n\nA: That's not total battery used, it's the percentage of battery used out of all battery used for the last 4 days. So you started out with 100% battery on monday and on friday you had 80% left. If safari is listed as 74%, then that means about 15% of the 20% was used by safari.\n\nA: 12 minutes in 4 days - but keep in mind other apps may pull up a Safari view, and iOS may be counting that depending on the method the apps use to do it. \nTwitter and Mail are two likely culprits there. \n", "Q: Is it possible to invoke play button using terminal? I want to control my media player (iTunes, Spotify, etc) using terminal. My goal was simply to trigger press on play/pause button using script. Is that possible?\n\nA: You can control iTunes using AppleScript:\ntell application \"iTunes\" to play\n\nTo run it directly from Terminal command line, you can use osascript:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"iTunes\" to play'\n\nTo figure out what commands are available in iTunes, use the ScriptEditor app and open the dictionary of iTunes, see How do I find out the applescript commands available for a particular app?\n\nA: I'm not certain about Spotify etc, but for iTunes if Doug's Applescripts for iTunes can't do it, it probably can't be done. It's got to be the longest running & most comprehensive site for all things iTunes.\nIf that's not enough, there are half a dozen apps too.\n\nA: osascript is depreciated in macOS 10.13 (high sierra) making the previous solutions unusable. \nmischah has created a nice commandline that can be used to control (and search!) itunes from the commandline: \nhttps://github.com/mischah/itunes-remote\nit doesnt do Shuffle or Volume - but you can search, play, stop, next from the terminal. \ni had to do brew install npm - to get it to compile, but brew is quite well supported in the terminal, and this provides a more than acceptable alternative to the lack of osascripting of itunes. \ncheers from toronto island,\njp\n", "Q: OS X copy paste into Terminal adds fdbf bfb9 b083 to beginning and end of selection For the life of me, I can't figure this out.\nWhen using a browser (doesnt matter which), if I select text, then paste in Vim or Neovim, I see characters added to the beginning and end of my selection.\nFor example, I select \"answer\" from this page, then paste it over in Terminal I get:\n??????answer??????\nSaving this pasted data to file with .bin extension and then opening in Vim with this auto command helper:\naugroup Binary\n   au!\n   au BufReadPre  *.bin let &bin=1\n   au BufReadPost *.bin if &bin | %!xxd\n   au BufReadPost *.bin set ft=xxd | endif\n   au BufWritePre *.bin if &bin | %!xxd -r\n   au BufWritePre *.bin endif\n   au BufWritePost *.bin if &bin | %!xxd\n   au BufWritePost *.bin set nomod | endif\naugroup END\n\nI get this output:\n0000000: fdbf bfb9 b083 616e 7377 6572 fdbf bfb9  ......answer....\n0000010: b083 0a       \n\n                       ...\n\nSo, you can see that I get\nfdbf bfb9 b083\n\nadded to the beginning, and I get\nfdbf bfb9 b083\n\nadded to the end.\nAny ideas on what this is about?\nThe only recent major change I can remember is upgrading OS X to Yosemite, so sure that's potentially a large update.\nI suspect Terminal is the source of the issue.

Neovim does not support it yet[2]. You get the error above if an application acts like it can support that mode, but fails to support it.\nIn neovim open a terminal window. With 'always' in the clipboard, run the following:\npbpaste | xxd\n\nThere should be no errors. Now run the following:\ncat | xxd\n\nEnter ⌘-v followed by Ctrl-D.\nYou should expect to see the errors.

Note that indexing may be delayed due to\n     low disk space or other conditions. \n\nEDIT:\nin your case (but this is specific to OP), you forgot to cd (change directory) into the volume before deleting the index files and adding a few files.

Now I would like to move most photos and videos from her Photos library into my Photos library.\nHow can I do this easily? \n\nA: I think the easiest way to do this is to export the photos from her library and then copy them to /Users/[username]/Public/Drop Box. You can access these public folder from every other account on your computer and import the photos into the new library.\n\nA: Really, you can't.  \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-10211\nShort answer, if you like to edit, rate, or adjust your photos.  You have no way to migrate photos in libraries non-destructively without paying Apple for iCloud.\n\nA: It can be done with PowerPhoto's merging capability. It's not free though.\n\nA: Still no simple built in answer, but an additional app is PhotosTakeout.\nUsing this tool, you can conveniently export the photos from the original Library. Then you would import them into the other Library. Then delete from the source Lib.\nIn truth, PowerPhotos will have to do the same operation. It cannot move them in one step, but can only copy them, leaving you to manually clean up by deleting the copied pix from the original Library. But that is one less step than with PhotosTakeout.\n\nA: There is a way to merge libraries: iCloud photo library.\n\n*\n\n*Move both libraries to the same user account (/Users/Shared is a good place to do this).\n\n*Set up Library A in iCloud Photo Library. You do this by making it the system library in Photos preferences.\n\n*Once the sync has finished, open Library B and make it the system library and turn on iCloud Photos.\n\n*You should now have both sets of photos in your iCloud library.

Bring up print menu, 3. switch to a preset or page size, as all the other options including scaling are default., 4. press print/enter.\n\nA: Let's split the problem into two parts: scaling and printing.\nScaling\nYou can scale a PDF on the command line. Consider creating a temporary, scaled, PDF to print. \nSee scaling PDF content and page dimensions from command line for suggested approaches to this. The highest voted answer suggests using cpdf with a command like:\ncpdf -scale-page \"1.1 1.1\" in.pdf -o out.pdf\n\nAn alternative tool is sips. This tool is included with OS X and is surprisingly capable.\nPrinting\nAs you have discovered, OS X's printing system is the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS). CUPS includes the command line tool lpr which can accept all the settings and options you need.\nFor printing the PDF via the command line see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Print PDF from Command Line – cups-pdf, lpr -P PDF\n\n*CUPS printing of pdf files\nTo list the available printers, use:\nlpstat -p -d\n\nTo print a PDF file to the default printer, use:\nlpr file.pdf\n\n\nA: What I ended up doing was using open and osascript along with a tool pdfcrop from MacRumor's forum user Oligarch (Wayback Machine backup to archive)\n./pdfcrop /path/to/file.pdf -u in -p 6.68 1.82 -a tr -o 0.14 0.23 > ./0.pdf && \\\n./pdfcrop /path/to/file.pdf -b m -u in -p 3.30 1.82 -a tr -o 0.14 0.23 > ./1.pdf && \\\n./pdfcrop /path/to/file.pdf -b m -u in -p 3.38 1.78 -a tr -o 3.43 0.24 > ./2.pdf && \\\nopen ./1.pdf ./2.pdf && \\\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to delete POSIX file \"'/path/to/file.pdf'\"' -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to delete POSIX file \"'./1.pdf'\"' -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to delete POSIX file \"'./2.pdf'\"'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*It takes the original file, and creates three copies. One with the pdf cropped to size (crop box, none destructive) that I keep, and two cropped to size (media box) that are temporary.\n\n*It then opens them with Preview, as two pages/files in the same window.\n\n*It then tells Finder via Applescript to delete the temporary files, in a Finder, move to the trash manner. Same as if I ⌘-Delete the files.\n\n*Once in Preview, I can ⌘-P to print both files. Only thing I need to do is change the paper size, Preview handles the scaling.\n\n\nObviously, it doesn't do everything I want, but it helps reducing the amount of manual cropping and going back and forth to make sure everything I need printed is printed.\nSince CPDF can scale and crop, It should be easier to do all via command line. I just need to test it out.\n", "Q: Share screen on Mac/iPhone without having Apple TV I am gonna to have a telephone with my customer to present our first milestone of one app we are building for customer (I am a PO). I have to call him by telephone and I want to share my iphone screen via Mac in realtime. I googled and there is AirPlay with Apply TV.

My client wants to distribute apps only to his employees for business purposes, like in-house application. He wants the feature like TestFlight which is acting like App Store where we can update the app and install the app every time the developer update the app. He doesn't want to submit his app to App Store. In order to make his employees to use easily, he also said, his employees can install the app easily and show the update easily like Testflight without expire date or limited testers. I found hockey app , but it requires testers to be Hockeyapp members.\nAny Help?\n\nA: Mobile Device Management (MDM) or Mobile Application Management (MAM) solutions can be used to distribute in-house apps to the employees. For this, they'll need to enroll the employees' devices in MDM or MAM. After this, they can upload in-house apps to the MDM console and bulk push to the enrolled devices. It is also possible to distribute apps that are in the App Store.\nCan you make it clear what you told about TestFlight, as I didn't catch it? You said \"He wants the feature like TestFlight\", but TestFlight is an independent service (MDM do not come with TestFlight). Head on to the section 'TestFlight Beta Testing' in this article and you'll learn more about it.\nThe app that distributed through TestFlight is the 'beta app' which have a life of 60 days for each build. On the other hand, 'in-house apps' have an infinite lifetime.\nIf you need to know anything from me, leave a comment. I am happy to help.\n", "Q: How I can export analytic data from iTunes Connect I have iTunes Connect account, I want to export the analytics from iTunes Connect and then generate a report in my own system. I read many article but haven't been able to find any api to connect to iTunes Connect remotely. Any help in this regards will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Navigate to Analytics for the appropriate app, then select the Metrics tab, then select a metric. There is a download icon (the box with the down arrow in the screenshot below) which you can click on for a CSV file. You can also select an option from the View By dropdown. As far as I know, there is no download all stats functionality sadly. Also, the analytics functionality is available for the iTunes Connect Admin, Finance, and Sales roles.\n\n\nA: If you want to download your app store data automatically without navigating manually to iTunes Connect, Apple offers the Reporter Tool which is an API. It takes some programming skills but is a reliable interface that can be adapted to your needs. We are currently developing a Google Sheets Add-on that will import your app statistics directly into Sheets. This includes all available reports and a schedule function on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

Our site is in an iframe which is on a different domain to the main window.\nIt seems like our cookies are being blocked by Safari when in private mode.\nInterestingly, if the cookies already exist (ie. if we login through the main window, and then go to this page) then it allows the cookies and you can see them in the web inspector. But if you try to log in through this iframe when in private mode, the login fails, and it appears to be because Safari is blocking the cookies.\nIs this a private browsing setting which can be changed perhaps? The information I've found about how private browsing affects the way Safari treats cookies has been inconsistent.\nAny information or ideas that anyone has would be much appreciated.\n\nA: I know this was asked over a month ago now, however I'll answer incase you haven't found the answer and for future users.\nIt is to do with safaris cookie policy that is set by default. As by default safari will only allow cookies from sites that you have visited.\nIt does not use, therefore, any cookies set by the webpage that is within an iframe. This is because the location of the top frame (the page that has the iframe) is a different domain to the iframe, and if the user has never been to the domain of the site contained within the iframe, safari will not use the cookies set by the iframe.\nTherefore, if a user were to go to the \"main window\" or the domain within the iframe, safari knows that you have visited this site, and will allow cookies set by this site/domain to be used.\nYou can check the policy safari is using when in safari, if you click Safari (top left) then Preferences a dialog box should appear. Along the top you should see a privacy tab. In the privacy tab, the first settings you should see are the cookies and website data. By default this will be set to Allow from websites I visit however this needs changing to Always allow for the cookies in an iframe to work without a coded solution. Alternately, you could look into a coded solution, such as this or this\n", "Q: Errors in installing OpenMPI on El Capitan I'm following this guide to install OpenMPI on my Mac. I think everything is going well, but now I'm at the step where I have to make all.

Maybe the license agreement should have been done before this step.\n\nA: I find the solution to my problem. The the license agreement was required to be completed before ./configure --prefix=/usr/local (as I suspected and @klanomath confirmed). If not so, the command make all can't be run.\n", "Q: Multiple apps from a developer account We have a developer account and a published app on the ios app store.

So i have a late 2009 21,5 iMac and whatever i do it's sooo hot!\nLike right now just typing this or watching youtube it gets up to 50 degrees celsius... It does not get any hotter than that and i'm not running any specific programs that are big. I have SMC Fan control but just asking should it be that hot? I know the aluminum case works like a heatsink but really 50 celsius hot???\n\nA: The 21.5-inch, Late 2009, iMac has either a E7600 or E8600 Intel Core 2 Duo with a TCASE (Case Temperature is the maximum temperature allowed at the processor Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS).) temperature of 74.1°C and 72.4°C respectively.  So if the CPU is reading only 50°C, then it's not running hot at all.\n", "Q: iOS - Getting iPhone 6s plus storage full alert message Since yesterday, I'm getting a storage full alert message (not iCloud) on my iPhone 6s plus, iOS 9.2.1. \nOverall, my apps installed would take at most 10GB. \nWithin Settings, the iPhone says it has 4.8 GB free. \nInside of iTunes, it says 8.4 GB free. \nAlso from iTunes, the Documents and Data section seems to take a lot of space (55% to 60% aprox.).\nHas anyone have a solution around this?\n\nA: I'm also having the same issue like you are. I was using the Public Beta version 4 of iOS 9.3 and that suddenly happened, it threw 710MB of free space on my phone into an unknown black-hole. I forced installed the iOS 9.2.1 (13D20 version) onto my iPhone 6 last night, freeing 16 GB from the phone. However I've lost them all again today with only 2.2 GB of free space left. The documents and data cannot be seen in the storage settings on my iPhone 6 at all. You're not alone on this one.\n\nA: It's getting hard to know what's happening since iTunes often shows more then 2 to 10 GB of difference on the \"free space\" number that iOS self reports.\nThe iOS system has four categories of data:\n\n\n*\n\n*third party application data that is marked as \"purgeable\"\n\n*third party application data that is marked as \"non-purgeable\"\n\n*application cached data which is there for speed and will be cleared when you run low on space / regenerated when you launch that app again\n\n*Apple's own iCloud data\n\n\nWhen I'm in a low space situation, here's what I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*look for easy things I can delete - entire applications (podcasts or apps, video & movie downloads or turning off big users like iCloud photo stream. Things I don't need when I'm facing a recurring prompt and that will re-download overnight when I'm in WiFi range.\n\n*turn off iCloud backup (I think, but can't prove there's a bug there on iOS 9 leaking storage space)\n\n*put the device in AirPlane mode\n\n*power of the iOS device\n\n*restart the device\n\n\nThen I re-examing the free space on iOS and compare with iTunes if I can. If you can get 2 GB of free space, things usually level off. Less than that, and every app you start can and will re-populate the caches and temporary space and you'll likely be back to \"no space\".\nI would set a calendar reminder to turn on iCloud backups in 24 hours - but make sure it's not depending on iCloud sync so that you can check storage space before you toggle that back on. I typically make an iTunes backup before turning it on. \nThe next step for me when the device isn't managing things properly is to erase the device and not restore the backup - so archiving that backup is a nice safety net if I find in a week I didn't have everything transferred off the phone.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/HT203282\nArchiving means first making a backup in iTunes and then control-clicking on the backup itself in preferences and choosing to Archive it. Things to consider are:\n\n\n*\n\n*health data only is saved to an encrypted backup\n\n*transferring purchases helps you not lose apps or data in apps if they are removed from the store after you installed them or after you complete the backup\n\n*some account and WiFi passwords and certificates are not saved to unencrypted backups\n\n\nThe archive feature prevents newer backups from overwriting the archived backup. The downside is the backup takes up more space than one that gets cleaned up/changed the next time you back up to iTunes.\n\nA: Maybe there are many \"Other\" category storage. There are just too many things that require physical storage in iPhone. That's why Apple chose to lump a lot of things into the \"Other\" category. it's seems like your phone is filled with cached files and data. That can include: Documents & Data & Safari browsing data\n& Mail data & iTunes data, including files that have been streamed (which can be BIG).\nSo we can try to clean up cache files frequently. someone who have similar situation with you, You can also refer to this thread. \nHave you checked your \"Recently deleted\" album? Maybe it takes up your storage. Since iOS 8, the pics and videos you deleted are not actually gone. If you want to make them disappeared you need to go to the \"Recently deleted\" album and delete them again. Otherwise you need to wait for 30 days they will be deleted automatically.\n\nA: Seems it was the app \"WhatsApp\", creating lots of cache files and stealing storage from the phone. \nI just installed the update and the storage came back to normal. \n\nA: Whatsapp is the issue.... Update and problem is gone\n", "Q: How to resume OS X apps that have been suspended by the system I often run into the situation where the OS will suspend some of my apps because of low memory.  If I am lucky, a window will appear that allows me to select which apps I want to quit and which apps I want to resume, which works reliably and is fine.  However, often that window does not appear.  This is usually the case when my machine (mid-2015 MBP 15\", 16GB RAM, OS X 10.11.2) has just woken from sleep.  In that case, the only symptom is that I have a bunch of unresponsive apps that show as (Not responding) in Activity Monitor.   \nI have tried to resume processes by sending the CONT signal (either via Activity Monitor or via the Terminal) and for a small number of apps this works, but for the majority of apps it does not.  For example, when this happened to me just now, I force quitted Preview (which was the chief memory hog) and tried to resume the other apps with CONT.  This worked fine for Clear, but not for anything else.  In some cases, such as Emacs, it had no effect - process still shows as (Not responding).  In other cases, such as Bibdesk, it leaves the app in a strange unusable state where the main window refuses to appear on screen and the menus don't work. \nSo how can I force that process management window to appear, or otherwise do whatever magic it is doing to \"resume\" apps?\n\nA: More googling revealed that the process management window I am looking for is the \"Force Quit Applications\" dialog, and that it can be easily accessed from the Apple () menu or with the keyboard shortcut Command Option Escape.  In normal use, this only has a Force Quit button, but it should also have a Resume button if the system suspends any of my processes again (although I can't directly test this at the moment). \n\nA: I encountered this same issue. THe CONT signal did not work and there was no Resume button on the Force Quit dialog. I did not want to force quit the app, because I would lose my work. Here is what worked for me:\nI sent a STOP signal through Activity Monitor and the app resumed, in this case word, and popped a dialog asking if I wanted to save my work. I selected cancel and began using the app as normal.\n\nA: kill command with -CONT option will resume an application.

I was thinking: would there be a way to browse the Internet through text messages?\nI know there used to be something like this in existence for Android, called the Cosmos web browser, but I am looking for an iPhone solution.\nWhat I want is to be able to, for example, send a url through text message to a server (or to my home computer), and get back the html of the requested page, that I could then plug into an HTML viewer. Eventually, I could copy paste a link from that page into another message, and get back the corresponding page.\nAnother idea: Since I have limited space on my device (only a few gigs), could I set up some sort of service at my home computer to which I could request a movie title through text, and it would send me the corresponding binary or hex of the entire video file through text... Then, I could copy/paste that into a viewer?\nI have a Windows computer at home.\nPlease let me know if some sort of text web browser exists for iPhone, or if this is even feasible.\n\nA: A week later, I found what I was looking for. After playing around with Google Voice and SMS APIs, I stumbled across an online service that offers exactly what I want, for free.\nIt's called txtWeb, and consists of just messaging 898-932 with your command, ex. @www YouTube.com returns:\n(X)\n(Y)Upload\n* Home\n\n* (Z)Trending\n* \n      o (X) Home\n      o (Z) Trending\n  -----\n* Best of YouTube\n\n      o (A) Music\n      o (B) Sports\n      o (C) Gaming\n      o (D) Movies\n      o (E) TV Shows\n      o (F) News\n      o (G) Live\n      o (H) Spotlight\n      o (I) 360° Video\n  -----\n* \n      o (J) Browse channels\n  -----\n* Sign in now to see your \nchannels and recommendations!\n\n  (K)Sign in\n  -----\n* \n      o (L) YouTube Red\n (N) Show ad...<br/><br/>\nReply M for more<br/>---<br/><\nbr/><br/></body></html>\n\nWhich is a bit outrageous but fulfills exactly what I needed.\nOther commands include @wikipedia [query], or @daak, which offers a rudimentary email checking interface for gmail.\nFun.\n\nA: That is not feasible. The SMS API does not allow any third party app to send SMS. Same for SMS reception. SMS app doesn't allow receiving binaries. \nYou could encode it in Base64 kind of encoding but that would be real slow and need you to copy/paste a lot of content manually.\nIMHO forget this I'm sorry.\n", "Q: Update emacs that comes with OS X Is there a way to update the emacs terminal editor that comes with OS X? I could remove the binaries and install Emacs using a dmg package, but the idea was to upgrade to a newer version with some command.\n\nA: Apple controls when / if they update emacs so most people just install a newer version of the tool and change their PATH variable so the new version is found first and runs by default.\nIf you like the sound of that, I recommend installing Homebrew:\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nThen install emacs:\nbrew install emacs\n\nAdd a link so that it'll work as emacs in the Terminal:\nln -s /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/24.5/Emacs.app /Applications\n\nThis will install the 'stable' version. As of this writing, that's 24.5:\n» brew info emacs\nemacs: stable 24.5 (bottled), devel 25.0-dev, HEAD\nGNU Emacs text editor\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\n\nThis is significantly newer (24.5.1) than the version that came with El Capitan (22.1.1):\n» emacs --version\nGNU Emacs 22.1.1\n\n\nA: It could be done but best not to do it. Certain directories including /usr/bin are updated and controlled by Apple so any changes there will be removed when the OS is updated, also in El Capitan and above this path is locked down by SiP and so you have to go through more hoops to chnage files there.\n$ ls -lO /usr/bin/emacs\n-r-xr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  restricted,compressed 35581744 Jan 13 20:12 /usr/bin/emacs\n\nHowever in practice there is no need to do this. Install a new emacs in places you have access to e.g. for command line in /usr/local/bin or ~/bin - or GUI versions in /Applications or ~/Applications. /usr/local/bin is the default path so in all cases you need to edit the path to put the directory containing emacs before /usr/bin.\n\nA: When using the brew command the correct command is brew upgrade emacs even if you have done a brew update, the install will install Emacs 25, the older version.\nJust sharing my experience. \n", "Q: 10.11: Good Samaritan message not showing on Filevault2 unlock screen You can set up a lock Message under System Preferences => Security & Privacy => General => Set Lock Message.\nThis Message is stored in NVRAM.

Been to the local Apple store several times with no success. Apple store say I need to do complete CLEAN REINSTALL of the OS - does anyone know if  I can just reinstall the Mail app by itself / or a scan to detect damaged files.\n\nA: You should be able to extract Mail.app from the OS X installer packages using Pacifist.\nRe-installing Mail however is unlikely to solve your problem.\nMail has an option to scale images. When composing a message with an image attachment a pop-up appears in the header section to set the desired image size. Make sure that is set to “Actual Size”.\nNext check if you have any Mail plugins installed that could cause the problem. Try removing plugins and adding them back one by one.\nNext create a new account on your Mac and set up Mail there. If the problem does not appear, it is linked to settings in your account.

I've never owned a Mac so I did some researching while looking at what to get. I saw a lot of articles saying to wait for the 2016 Macbook Pro to be released, since the 2015 version hasn't had many updates over the years. The only notable difference between the previous years has mostly been the CPU. \nThe 2015 version uses the 4th Generation Intel Haswell CPUs. The 2016 version will have the 6th Generation Skylake CPUs, and probably some other sort of hardware upgrades. \nSince I'm new to the Mac world, I was wondering if there would really be any benefit to waiting for the 2016 models to come out? I was also wondering about the price difference. At the moment I can get the 15 inch retina display, with the 512 GB SSD upgrade for $2169. \nI'm only going to use the laptop for basic use and programming (nothing graphically intense). In my perspective an i7 Haswell is by no means a bad CPU, and I could only see maybe up to a 10% increase in performance with the Skylake CPU, and maybe some minor increase in battery performance. \nSo I ask the Apple people, do you really thing there will be a big enough increase in hardware performance to wait for the 2016 release? I have a feeling the price may increase substantially, for a slight performance boost. \nIf I'm too off topic feel free to migrate to Hardware Recommendations\n\nA: The 2016 model's probably going to have Thunderbolt 3 which is usb-C compatible. It's quite possible that it's going to have a complete redesign and some of the ports like HDMI and SD-card slot might have to go. With Skylake there's going to be new Iros Pro integrated graphics which compete with current dGPU's of suitable thermal envelope for the MBP. As there's nothing significantly better available I think they are going to ditch the dGPU option for good and make the chassis smaller and lighter.\nAMD's Polaris and Nvidia's Pascal are coming in the second half of this year and they are going to outperform Iris Pro but I doubt Apple is going to wait for them as they are not so keen on ultimate graphics performance.\nThe next Apple event is going to be March 21 and there has been no solid rumors of anything that's going to be announced there. I believe we might see the new MBP there because there's really no reason for Apple to keep waiting when competitors are adopting the new high-end Skylake processors. A lot of retailers have the 2015 model on discount right now and their stock is running low. \nIf you dont't think you need a slight improvement in performance, the possible redesign and Thunderbolt 3, now is the time to jump on those discounts. The 2015 is by no means a bad laptop. \n", "Q: Is it possible to automatically sync my iMac and MacBook Pro I would like to keep all my files (i.e. pages/numbers/keynote) automatically synced between my iMac and MacBook Pro.

I just want to be able to open up either machine and have all identical files there automatically. Is this a pipe dream? \n\nA: If iCloud Drive (FAQ) isn't syncing fast enough for you (or you're not on El Capitan ) then you could try a commercial solution (per Gb most are cheaper) or you could use one of the \"roll-you-own\" solutions.\nThere are multiple commercial solutions that do this, in no particular order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dropbox\n\n*Microsoft's OneDrive\n\n*Box\n\n*Google Drive\nThen there's a range of self-hosted solutions which let you use your own network, servers etc to provide cloud storage & sync.\nOf course if you put your laptop to sleep if will always have sync changes from your desktop when it wakes up no matter what solution you use.\n", "Q: AirPort Extreme between two VLANS - intermittent response to ping I have a network topology I'm trying to set up with some TP-LINK switches with 802.1Q VLAN support.\nA technical detail is that I have two of these switches with an aggregate of two gigabit links set up as a trunk for 802.1Q to bind the two together.\nI currently have two VLANS: a DMZ and the LAN. My intention is to have one gateway between the modem and the DMZ and another gateway between the DMZ and the LAN. The latter is shown on this diagram:\n\nI have an AirPort Extreme for the second gateway. However, when both its LAN and WAN are connected to the same physical switch (though on different VLANS), it intermittently responds to pings (I.e. About 25% of the pings return). If I unplug either of the wires, it responds 100% (on the appropriate interface, of course).\nIf I put another gateway (some cheap Netgear thing) at the point labeled A in the diagram, suddenly it works exactly as expected.\nSo, why does the AirPort Extreme behave so strangely?\nYes, everything is set up correctly. Also, I have tried both with an AirPort Extreme and an AirPort Extreme and both with IPv6 set to Native and set to Local Link Only with no changes in behavior.\n\nA: I have the same issue. After putting wireshark on the switch it is clear regardless of the VLAN config the management IP is being arped on all ports. that means the apple extreme is seeing the same arp on both its lan and wan port. It basically puges seeing that,cannot handle it and you have your issue. putting the router in between prevents the one arp hitting the apple.\n", "Q: How to create a service that puts selected text into quotation marks? I'd like to create a service that puts any text I select in TextEdit or web page text editors into quotation marks. I understand Automator is the tool to use, but how do I create this action using AppleScript or another scripting language in OS X (Lion)?\n\nA: One way is to create a service that runs a shell command.\nFor this, open Automator, create a new Service, check \"Output replaces selected text\", then add the action \"Run Shell Script\". In the box where you enter the Shell script write:\ncat | sed 's/^/\"/' | sed 's/$/\"/' | sed 's/\"\"//'\n\nThis takes the text you entered as input, and adds a quotation mark at the beginning and end.\nNow, once you save your service, you can, for example, go to TextEdit, select the text you want to quote, then go to Services -> \"name of your service\", and your text should now be quoted!\n\nEdit: I included the removal of trailing double quotation marks\n", "Q: safari inspector how to add complex rules?

E.g the following, which turns natural scrolling off:\n$ defaults read -g com.apple.swipescrolldirection\n1\n\n$ defaults write -g com.apple.swipescrolldirection -bool false\n\n$ defaults read -g com.apple.swipescrolldirection\n0\n\nHowever, the above does not take effect immediately, one has to log off and on again for it to work.\nTo attempt to force the changes to take effect without logging out I attempted to kill my users cfprefsd process. This caused a new process to start up, but the changes did not take effect.\nNow to my problem. It seems my experimenting has caused something to break, cause I'm no longer able to change my scrolling direction. Not even from the System Preferences gui:\n \nIn fact, if I try to check 'Scroll direction: natural' it will uncheck itself. The exact same thing happens if I try to check 'Scroll direction: natural' in the 'Trackpad' window of System Preferences. And if I do $ defaults read -g com.apple.swipescrolldirection the value won't have changed.\nAnyone got any ideas?\nThanks.      \n\nA: Use defaults write -g com.apple.swipescrolldirection -bool NO\nIf it's automatically checking itself in the GUI it's because you have a invalid value set, IE: -int 0/1 using the BOOL value will restore functionality.\n\nA: I've found the only way is to restart the mac after you run one of those commands. That sets it for me.\n", "Q: Mac Freeze and Screen Goes Weird After RAM Upgrade I've a MacBook Pro. I upgraded it's RAMs to 16 GB of 1600MHz(two 8 GB modules). Even though Apple suggests a maximum of 8GB, everymac.com's tests yield that it supports 16GB. And it did.\nAfter the upgrade my Mac booted as normal and everything was usual until I got a freeze and the following situation in my screen.\n\nI restarted my Mac and it was back to normal until it happened again. I also thoroughly cleaned the inside of my Mac(including the RAM ports) so that no dust is in the way of the circuitry.\nA quick Apple hardware test returned no problems as well. At night, I left it alone to make a thorough test but when I woke up, it was long finished and booted automatically into OS X. So I couldn't see those results.\nI also reseted my NVRAM, SCM and used Disk Utility to fix the permissions and check the hard-drive state.\nTherefore I replaced it back with the old modules that came with my Mac.\nI'm thinking of bad RAM modules. When it goes to that block it crashes. I already started the return process for the new RAMs I purchased but wanted to get a second opinion. The broken pixels with the ripples are related with the RAM modules, right?\nThanks.\n\nA: TL;DR: You probably want to exchange the RAM you bought for new sticks.\nFrom your picture, it looks like that's a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012). As you mentioned, it does support 2x8 GB (16 GB total) at 1600 MHz (PC3-12800).\nIf the issue doesn't occur with the original RAM, you can be fairly sure that your memory slots are good. It's very likely that the issue lies in the modules themselves.\nYou can use a tool like Memtest86+ to test the RAM completely to help narrow down where the issue is. It could be one stick, or it could be both.\nI recommend installing a single 8 GB stick, running through the full battery of tests, and then repeating with the other stick in the same slot. By testing them one at a time, you can easily determine which module is bad.\nIf both pass, then you can try the same together. If they only fail as a pair, there could be a timing issue or something else going on with the RAM.\nTo be absolutely sure that there's not an issue with your memory slots (read: logic board), you should test your old modules as well.\nFinally, you mention that you purchased 1600 MHz RAM, but you'll want to confirm that. A common issue with Mac RAM installation is the use of higher clocked RAM under the assumption that it will correctly work on boards that want a lower clock.\nFor example, if you bought 2x8 GB at 1833 MHz, you might expect it to downclock to 1600 MHz for your computer. While normally that's true, Mac logic boards are very sensitive to the clock speed. Often, you'll get kernel panics, graphical issues, and general instability even though it may report as the clock speed you expect.\nThe solution is to purchase RAM that's the exact speed you want.\n\nA: I am having a similar problem. Just bought two memories 8GB Kingston for my MacbookPro9,2. (Macbook Pro 13\" mid 2012 i5 2.5)\nMy guess is that memories slot had some things (dust maybe) and that cause the problems.\nI tested the memories separately, and the machine worked fine.\nRight now I have the 16GB of RAM and so far (2h) so good.\nBut if anyone knows something about it, I appreciated the inside.\n", "Q: Lock Dock To 1 Screen I'm using 2 screens and I keep hitting the bottom of the second screen and the dock jumps to that screen. The problem is it doesn't jump back if you do the same on the original screen. \nIs there anyway to stop it from moving? I will never want it on anything other than the original screen, it just freaks me out. \n\nA: The only workaround I've found for this issue is to change the dock position from Bottom to Left/Right (System Preferences > Dock & Menu Bar). Once you've done that the dock will only appear on your main display (as set in System Preferences > Displays > Display Settings...).\nAs I say, it's more of a workaround than a solution: I haven't found a solution that still allows you to position the dock at the bottom of the screen.\n", "Q: El Capitan download problems I am trying to update a mac mini from OS 10 10 5 up to ElCap\nApp store tells me the app has Downloaded but nothing happens\nI have looked at a few posts on this forum so have looked in the Apps folder but there is no El Cap installer there.\nAny ideas how I can force another download, or find the installer on my machine(assuming it has actually downloaded)\nAny ideas\n\nA: Try to restart your computer and try repeat last actions.\nIt was helpful at similar discussion.\n", "Q: Mac repeatedly getting stuck at progress bar I have lately been experiencing this problem on my Mac book pro 13\" mid 2010 where it usually hangs and doesn't  resume normal working.

I would like to clean up my backups since there are a lot of files which I don't need to access anymore (e.g. videos, podcasts and installation packages). The problem I am facing is however that I don't know which snapshots contain these large files and in which directories I used to store them. Is there perhaps a way to list the largest files in the Time Machine backup, similar to Grand Perspective or Disk Inventory X?\n\nA: Yes - you can find large files in many ways.\nIn the finder search field type size:>9000 and add a size field if you wish in the list view to sort descending. Add zeroes to the number to get less results back for your file sizes.\nThis doesn't work well for network backups in my experience due to lag or incomplete spotlight databases. If that doesn't work, get a tool made to analyze Time Machine backups like BackupLoupe. It is crafted specifically to efficiently scan time machine backup drives and network volumes. It creates a comprehensive backup database of all the files and revisions that would make your size query a snap.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the app\n\n*Let it index one or more intervals\n\n*Use the app's find window to sort on size after setting the search criteria as follows: Type is directory and match type of none of the following is true\n\n\n\n\nIt also helps to reveal the files in Finder so you could decide to remove that file across backups or just to delete that interval entirely.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove unnecessary backups from TimeMachine to get space\n\n*How can I manually delete old backups to free space for Time Machine?\nSince Time Machine stores each backup in folders, you could unleash any other tool (DaisyDisk, Grand Perspective, WhatSize or other) on the backup, but they don't know how to interpret hard links and may take days or months to make a picture that doesn't represent the actual storage allocations. \nBackupLoupe is smarter than the existing tools and doesn't double count hard linked files. It also runs in the background if you wish. Lastly, it reads a database file summarizing the backups so the results are near instantaneous and you don't even need the backup drive mounted to do the reporting.\n\nA: I see two questions in your post, the title \"Is there a way to list the largest files and folders in Time Machine backups?\" and the one in the body, \"Is there perhaps a way to list the largest files in the Time Machine backup, similar to Grand Perspective or Disk Inventory X?\"\nThere is no Time Machine specific software that I'm aware of that providers the perspective/view of the disk of the Time Machine Backup which Grand Perspective or Disk Inventory X provides and therefore I have to say the answer to the latter question is no.\nAs to the question in the title and aside from various third party apps that do provide various functions you can also just enter Time Machine and do a search through the Finder window using the Search dialog to formulate various queries, around e.g. size, and use the Size column to rack from large to small, etc.\n", "Q: How do I get a lone missing app to appear in Spotlight searches? When I enter a string that matches part of the name of an application on Mac, the OS X Spotlight search feature will suggest apps for me to launch. This works for every app except one: Mathematica:\n\nWhile the string is recognized (presumably from my history) the application is not suggested, and the only way to launch it is directly from the Finder or some other awkward workaround.\nWhy would — indeed how could —  a single lone application behave differently in this regard? How can an application hide itself in this way from Spotlight? \nAnd most importantly: what can I do to restore this standard piece of functionality?\n\nNote that this problem is unique to Mathematica. For example for JetBrains apps, I get:\n\nMoreover, it extends to the Finder itself. For example if I search there I get\n\neven though Mathematica is clearly there\n\nI can reproduce this (for Mathematica only) by simply updating (download, open the DMG, drag the new version to the Applications folder, replace). This is indeed unique to Mathematica (in my experience). I update at least one app a day in this or similar ways, and none of them vanish as a result from Spotlight; only Mathematica.\n\nA: I was facing the same issue with Todoist and Microsoft Outlook. The answer above didn't solve the problem for me on MacOS Sierra 10.12.6, as you can only exclude whole folders now in the Spotlight Privacy tab. I tried that, but it didn't help. However a similar solution worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Spotlight > Search Results\n\n*Untick 'Applications'\n\n*Close the settings\n\n*System Preferences > Spotlight > Search Results\n\n*Tick 'Applications'\n\n\nA: While this does not directly answer as to why that particular app does not appear in Spotlight, nonetheless as a workaround, try the following:\nExplicitly exclude the App, via drag and drop from Finder, into System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy, and then close/reopen Spotlight preferences and remove the App by selecting it, then click the minus button [-] at the bottom left of the list window.\nThe App should now appear in Spotlight, however it may disappear again if the root cause is triggered again.\n\nA: For me the answer was, in the same fashion as the accepted answer, to exclude the entire harddrive and then re-eanble it. \nAs described here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7356551\nNote: this is also the method recommended by Apple for rebuilding the Spotlight index, see support article here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201716\n", "Q: Find text in Notes app on iPad Pro Is it possible to search for text in the Notes app on an iPad Pro?\nThe closest I have gotten is the search field to the left of the Home screen, but that does not find the fifth occurrence of that text.

It might be a feature that Apple will add in the future, but for now, Spotlight search on iOS will help you can only perform the basic \"if note contains this word, display note\" searches. There's also no \"Find\" function within the Notes app.\n\nA: I think you may be missing the \"Show More\" link above each search group.\nFor example if I search for the word \"Joomla\" on my iPad Pro I get this result:\n\nClicking on the \"Show More\" to the top right of an Application's result set reveals the rest of the matches, like this:\n\n", "Q: Error when using \"pmset sleepnow\" Whenever I use pmset sleepnow in Terminal (even with sudo) I get this error:\nUnable to sleep system: error 0xe00002e2.

Galaxy's feature I liked was click on a photo, then more info, and if the photo was geotagged, it would open a map showing location. \nI can only show location of groups of photos on my iPhone, is there any way to select a single photo and show the location on a map? I see the generic location (i.e., Downtown Long Beach) but I can not see a specific location.\nAnyone know a way to bring up a map of a single selected photo?\n\nA: In iOS 12 fsb’s answer doesn’t seem to work any more. A different way is via Apple’s Shortcut app. In the gallery you can find a shortcut named “Where was this taken?”. If you add this and let the actions show up in the share sheet. Then you will be taken to the location by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the photo\n\n*Press the “share” icon\n\n*Select “Shortcuts”\n\n*Select “Where was this taken?”\n\n*Done, you should now see the map app and the location of your photo\n\n\nA: You can see the exact location by following these steps (iOS 9.3.1).  These steps assume the photo contains geolocation info, this info might have been removed by the author.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Settings, ensure you can see locations for photos in Privacy --> Location Services --> Camera.\n\n*In Photos, find the image, or images, you want the location.  There will be a header across the top with the general location.\n\n*Tap on the general location header (i.e. Downtown Long Beach), not the image.  This will take you to the Maps app with the location the image was taken.  If there's multiple images, you can see the exact location for each image.\n\n\nA: For years I've downloaded iPhone photos to a Windows PC and opened them in Irfanview (an amazing free photo handling tool.) With a photo open you select Image>Information>EXIF info*>Show in Google Maps (or Google Earth, or Open Street, or Geo-Hack Wiki) and the map with ~ location shows up.

I cant find if ACMT (Apple Certified Mac Technician) cover also iOS devices, I work in big company full of iPhones and we send to repair at least 10 iPhones every month so it will be better to repair them at the company. What certification I need to be able to repair phone without loose warranty? \n\nA: You need both certificates so you can fix iPhones as well. Also if your company is registered as Apple Authorized Service Provider Program you can. If you need help with the certificates one very good app. is IT Technicians Professionals on Apple Store, you have all questions up to date.\n\nA: It's unlikely you would do anything but whole device swaps for iOS repairs due to the touch screen calibration issues. That being said - 10 a month should tip things so that the time you save arranging 10 swaps beats your current expense arranging repairs now even if you didn't benefit from any of the other great aspects of SSA.\nWhy not get started with the self-service page and see what the program offers you? In my experience, the access to knowledge base and the service web applications far outweighs the repair benefits. Especially helpful is the dedicated diagnostic server. If you have the required 1000 devices this opportunity is almost a slam dunk win for you. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/programs/ssa/\nI wouldn't go ACMT unless you a) wanted the challenge and growth opportunity for your employees b) didn't have any decent local options for AppleCare.

However, seeing launchctl involved, I ran launchctl list | grep team and lo and behold I found a couple of entries related to TeamViewer.  So then I tried the following commands:\nsudo launchctl stop com.teamviewer.service\nsudo launchctl stop com.teamviewer.teamviewer\nsudo launchctl stop com.teamviewer.Helper\nsudo launchctl stop com.teamviewer.service\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.teamviewer.teamviewer.plist\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.teamviewer.teamviewer_desktop.plist\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.teamviewer.*\nsudo launchctl remove /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.teamviewer.*\nsudo launchctl remove /Library/LaunchAgents/com.teamviewer.*\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/com.teamviewer.*\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.teamviewer.*\n\nThere are no more files I can find that are related to TeamViewer.

But I still see the above messages every 10 seconds in system.log, even after running all those commands!\nHow do I make it stop?!\n\nA: I had the same problem. If you know a bit of Terminal , I suggest to do this on the command line:\nfind ~/Library/ -name 'com.teamviewer*'\n\nand\nfind /Library/ -name 'com.teamviewer*'\n\nThis will probably show a few files, probably in ~/Library/Preferences and /Library/LaunchAgents, and maybe some other places.\nThen you remove those using\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/com.teamviewer*\n\nand similarly all other directories/files that came up with the find command. \nYou get the idea.\n\nA: I originally tried to uninstall it and that made it worse, with TeamViewer logging 6-8 messages per second. So I then re-installed TeamViewer so I could uninstall it again, but this still left me with a couple of their services logging several messages per second. \nIn the end what worked for me was to use AppZapper.\n\nA: In my case it was the /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.teamviewer.* files trying to autolaunch the daemons at login. Removing these files manually resolved the issue. Same for com.crashplan.* files.\n\nA: This kind of behavior is usually the result of a leftover .plist file, startup daemon or something similar.

Open the Settings app and tab “Wi-Fi” settings > Look at targeted the wi-fi router / network name that want to reveal the password> tap on the (i) info button.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You then should see Router ip address:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open safari > type the Router ip address > Enter. You then is directed to the Router login panel page.\n\n\n\nThe router model is now revealed. You can attempt to login with default user/password (they normally are admin/admin). However, you can go on google to search the exact default user/password quickly with specific Router Model.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: How can I open a specific port on OS X 10.11.13 I am currently working with msfvenom on OS X. But I wanted to know, the terminal commands to open a specific port say for example 4444. Can someone please help me out with this?\n\nA: You can use the terminal command nc -l 4444 to create a server that listens on port 4444.  However, I think your question really is about opening a port on your router.  If someone else out on the internet somewhere is trying to connect to you on port 4444, the router you have acts as a boundary between you and them, and most often all incoming ports by default are closed.  So even if you run a server on your Mac and it's listening on port 4444, traffic on that port needs to be allowed through at the router level.\nPlease give us more info so we can help you.\n\nA: You can use python to run a simple server that opens whatever port you wish.\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 4444\n\nIf you have no firewall, the port is now open. Press Control + C to quit the process and close the port again or test the port from your client as needed.\nIf you have the default firewall, you will be prompted to actually open the port:\n\nLastly, if another process has the port open, you'll get an error of the stack trace that ends with the socket error indicating the port is already in use:\nsocket.error: [Errno 48] Address already in use\n\nThat's it - ports open on OS X quite easily unless you've made a custom firewall setting.\n", "Q: Apple Agenda totally empty and \"updating\" endlessly Yesterday my agenda suddenly froze (with the spinner showing for at least half an hour. So I did a force quit, and opened it again, and now it just shows this:\n\nThe line \"Agenda's bijwerken...\" translates as \"Updating agendas\".\nIt has shown this for hours now, so I don't think anything is going on anymore. Most importantly though, the whole agenda seems empty in the background (and I don't have iCloud backups from the agenda).\nDoes anybody know what I can do to A) get the events from my agenda back, in whichever form possible, and B) get the Agenda working again. \nI'm pretty good on the command line, so messing around in system files won't be a problem for me. I just don't have a clue where to start. If it's important; I'm on OSX 10.11.2.\nAll tips are welcome!\n\nA: I don't know the reason why this is happening, but I had this once. I think it's connected somehow with error of synchronization, it just gets into loop, and never recovers back.\nFirst of all, try to Force Quit for this app, and then to restart. In some cases it helps.\nSecond scenario, if the previous one haven't helped to troubleshoot, is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up system Preferences and navigate to accounts  > System Preferences > Accounts\n\n*Deactivate the iCloud. (try deselecting calendars, as well)\n\n*Restart iCal.\n\n\nIf it haven't, then you need to clean the cache. Instructions described here helped to restore:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iCal/Calendar.\n\n*Make backup copies of these files before deleting them. (!important in case something goes wrong)\n\n*Delete the calendar cache found here:\n~/Library/Calendars/Calendar Cache\n~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iCal (if these files exist)\nYou may try the second scenario, provided by the link above, but in this case, you will lose the not saved events, which were not synced with your account. You additionally would need to do these actions:\n\n\n*Delete the Events directory found here:\n~/Library/Calendars/*.calendar/Events\n\n*Delete the application's preference files here:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.helper.plist (if this file exists)\nAnd then to reconfigure the preferences and accounts.\n", "Q: Mac OS X unusual bash activity? So when I checked my computer this morning I had Terminal open saying:\nLast login: Sat Mar 5 00:02:43 on ttys000\nI checked uptime and it's been up 27 days, 2 users as usual. \nNow I know for a fact that at that precise time I had left my laptop in someone's room for a couple of hours and when I looked through history, I found these commands were most recent (pretty sure it was not me as i recall the previous set):\ncd ~/Library\ncd Messages/\nl\nls\ncd Archive\ncd ~\nexit\n\nWhen I repeated the commands I got as far as producing \nAttachments    chat.db chat.db-shm chat.db-wal\nBut past that I can't trace or understand what the next command did.\nTried to change the history log to show date/time stamps on the history logs but they all just came out as today's date, I guess because I only just applied the format to it now. \nI'm not a programmer, know v v little about any of this. Got as far as that ^ through Google. Could someone please explain what those commands most likely did, and whether I'm being paranoid in suspecting  that said person has tried to export my messages? The last previous command set (which I was there for) had ended in an archive of my most recent Pages work being sent over to somebody via iMessage - could that have been it? Just a bit weird because there was an \"exit\" just before this set, so it seems like somethings separate ... + I still can't explain the 00:02 login this morning..... Is there a way to prove the worst,  if it is so?\nThank you! \n\nA: The commands you listed in your question take you into the currently logged in user's Messaging App's message archive, lists the contents of that directory and then goes back to the currently logged in user's home directory.  If you were logged in, then it's your messaging archive.\nThe exit command exits, or closes, the Terminal session, nothing more.\nTo see who has logged into your computer (or when the last time you logged in from where), type the command last in your Terminal:\n$ last\nTo get a listing of the commands you have executed type:\n$ history\nIf you want to save that to a file for later reading, type this:\n$ history > ~/Desktop/history.txt \nand a file will show up on your Desktop with all those commands.  You can use the same technique for last but be sure to rename the file.\nNow, if you want to see what happens when you are not in front of your Mac, just clear out the history before you leave with the command history -c.  This way, you will see exactly what has been done when you weren't around.\nNow, you obviously have a 2AM login into your computer.  Why \na) do you not have a password \nor\nb) if you do have one, why is it shared with others?\n\nA: You can infer two facts that might be helpful:\nFirst, the login was from ttys000. This means that the login was not via the network, but local.\nSecond, since there is a typo in the commands (\"l\" instead of \"ls\") it certainly was a human typing these commands, and not a script. \nSo the question should be: who has physical access to your computer?\n", "Q: Item: \"Documents\", Kind \"Unknown\" in Login Items In my Login Items on Mac OS 10.11.3 I see an item called \"Documents\". The Kind is specified as \"unknown\" and there is a yellow warning sign at the end of the line. \nNo further information is shown when I hover or click the warning sign or the item. I checked the loginwindow.plist, but couldn't see anything relating to the item in question.\nI don't want to merely clear it out. \nDoes anyone know what this item is supposed to do and how I could further inquire what is wrong with it?\n\nA: Somehow or another it sounds like your Documents folder was added to your startup items. I think this used to be a way to have the Finder open a specific folder on login, but it hasn't worked that way for some time.\nIt is not serving any purpose now, and there's no reason to keep it.\n", "Q: Restore incomplete iCloud backup One month ago i lost my iPhone 5. Got a new one, 6S, and i'm trying to recover my old media. According to iCloud, there is a 1.5 GB Incomplete backup from the phone which is now gone. Is there anything I can do to salvage any of the data from this Incomplete 1.5 GB backup?Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Your iCloud backups should be stored in:\n/Users/[user name]/Library/Application\\ Support/MobileSync/Backup\nYou can use a backup extraction tool like this one (note that the free version is limited) to see what you can get from the backup, then transfer it to your phone via iTunes.\n", "Q: Is there an easy way to switch desktops on the remote computer using \"back to my mac\" I have just setup \"back to my mac\" and the connection works fine. My only \"complaint\" so far is that I haven't found a convenient way to switch from one desktop to another on the remote computer (or to any other full-screen app). Clicking on the icon in the dock works. But I was wondering if I missed some other way. \n\nA: The key command is control and left arrow or right arrow.\nYou can customize things further in Mission Control preferences as well.\nDepending on which VNC/RDC client you are using - the command keys might act locally if you are browsing from OS X - so you might need to eliminate multiple screens to pass those through. \nAlternatively, you can use/set a hot key for mission control and choose which screen you want from the top of the window. Changing the local shortcut will allow it to pass through to the remote OS X if that's blocking you.\n\nA: One can drag the Mission Control icon from the Applications folder to the Dock on the remote machine. By clicking on that icon one then has access to all the screens. That works well for me.\n", "Q: Best way to import analog video tape to Mac? I want to transfer my family's analog video tape collection to digital form on my Mac (mid-2014 MacBook Pro).  Unlike the asker in Best way to import analog video (VHS) to Mac, my goal is not to identify an inexpensive solution but rather to preserve video and audio quality.  I would prefer to do it myself because besides being naturally hands-on I can't risk these being lost/damaged/not-returned if sent out.\nDetails\nDetails of my particular situation follow, but please feel free to provide answers, background, and further considerations useful to future readers with similar but possibly varying needs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Our working Sony Hi8 XR CCD-TRV65 Video Camera Recorder\n(VCR)\n\nwhich has s-video and composite (not component) outputs through which\nI can still play...\n\n*Our 20 Hi8 MP 120 tapes\n\nwhich are 10 to 15 years old.\nHow can I best preserve the content of these tapes?\n\n\n*\n\n*What device and/or software should I use to transfer and convert the\nvideos into digital format?\n\n*What target video file format should I choose to preserve quality and\nmaximize flexibility?  Electronic-only files are fine with me -- I\ndon't particularly need or want to burn to DVD or Blu-ray.\n\n\nA: I recently did this type of project with a similar Sony Camcorder that didn't have a USB interface.  \nHere are the parameters (constraints) of the equipment we're working with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Audio is stereo/mono - left and right channels\n\n*Video output (as stated) is either S-Video or component - both of which can handle up to 480i (in the US).  IMO, color was better on the component, but YMMV.\n\n\nWhat's important to note here is this is the highest quality that will be achievable.  You won't be able to convert this to HD quality simply because the source isn't HD quality.\n\nWhat device and/or software should I use to transfer and convert the\n  videos into digital format?\n\nI used (and highly recommend) the Elgato Video USB Capture.\n\nThis was a plug-and-play device.  The included software was extremely easy to use.  When I used it, I was on Yosemite (10.10), however, I don't see any reason it wouldn't work with El Capitan or Sierra.\n\nWhat target video file format should I choose to preserve quality and\n  maximize flexibility?\n\nYour best bet would be to use H.264 MPEG-4, which the Elgato supports. From it's Wikipedia entry: \n\nAs of 2014 it is one of the most commonly used formats for the\n  recording, compression, and distribution of video content\n\nH.264 MPEG-4 is a format that's commonly used for Blu-Ray (DVDs) and for Internet services such as YouTube.  This will give you the highest amount of flexibility at the best resolution possible.\nAs far as audio, the Elgato Video Capture samples at 48 kHZ at 128bits which is considered \"professional grade\"\n\nThe standard audio sampling rate used by professional digital video\n  equipment such as tape recorders, video servers, vision mixers and so\n  on.\n\nThis is a rather inexpensive setup that worked extremely well (from personal experience).  It took me just over a week (about 100 tapes, not all were \"full\") to digitize everything.  But once that was done I was able to make backups to both HDDs and DVDs.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2013 keyboard and trackpad completely freeze The problem\nEvery once in while the keyboard and trackpad completely stop working and I have no way to affect the software. The mouse pointer is left frozen exactly where it was when the problem occurred and nothing on the keyboard works. The only solution I currently have is to push and hold the power key triggering a forced shut-down - implying keyboard funcitonality, but I'm wondering if this bypass is actually separate from the keyboard processing for the reason I am using it.\nI really don't know what this is as it's impossible to diagnose with no interaction tools!\nMy system\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro Retina, 13 inch, Late 2013\n\n*Processor 2.4 intel core i5\n\n*8gb 1600mhz ddr3\n\n*OSX Yosemite 10.10.2\n\n\nUsage\n\n\n*\n\n*typical developer machine: ITerm; Sublime; browsers; FileZilla; Slack; MAMP; Sketch\n\n*frequently have 30 or 40 Chrome tabs open\n\n*ten or so applications in total running at any given time\n\n*rarely restart formally, just sleep, I kind of assumed Macs are good at handling this\n\n\nThere are no obvious signs of overload like sluggish responsiveness.\nMy hunch\nIs that it's something to do with overheating, there seems a flaw in the design that means it doesn't handle sitting flat very well (work bought us stands for this purpose) though I haven't noticed a correlation between the fan noise, heat and this event yet.\n\nA: Try plugging in an external USB device, such as a phone or keyboard. I have found recently that this fixed my intermittent keyboard/trackpad issues perfectly.\nAs for why this is, I read on another site that the internal keyboard and trackpad on Macbooks connect over USB internally, so if the internal USB hub gets reset, it would force the keyboard and trackpad to reconnect. And after thinking about it, I am pretty certain that any time I have had keyboard/trackpad freezes like yours, I was also plugging in my Android phone, either to charge it or run diagnostics. I am pretty sure that plugging in my phone has been causing these issues. \n\nA: This happened once with my MacBook Pro and what I did is to reset the System Management Controller (SMC). Go ahead and shut down your MacBook (force shutdown if needed). Then plug the charger into your MacBook. After that press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of your keyboard and the power button at the same time until the indicator light on your charger temporary change to green colour. Now power on your computer normally.

When node updates a package, it doesn't remove the old version. You can also install old versions of a package using brew versions, but you will probably need to install the boneyard tap in order to be able to do this. See here and here.\nBased on this answer:\nUse ls $(brew --cellar) to determine what you have installed, and brew ls -v to see installed packages and versions. You can then call the installed binaries directly (or make your own aliases to them).\n", "Q: How do I change/delete alias in OS X permanently? I tried to modify/delete alias, but it seems that it is only for the current session by doing this\nunalias name\n\nor rename it\nunalias name='...'\n\nCan anyone tell me the way to change/delete it permanently? Thanks!\n\nA: I just solved it.\nIn order to make permanent change to alias, I need to edit a config file.\nnano ~/.bash_profile\n\nThan I enter the GNU nano editor window, then I make the change to the line that I want, maybe delete a line or change a line, for example:\nalias name='/Applications/FunProfile/GoodProgram'\n\nThen press control+o to save it, next press control+x+enter to exit it.\n", "Q: Enable/Disable TextExpander using Script I am trying to disable/enable textexpander using a single shortcut key. Text expander's preferences require using option, command and control together with a predefined shortcut key. Is there a way to bypass this using apple script and simply enable/or disable textexpander using a single shortcut key? Thanks.\n\nA: If it helps, you don't need to press all those keys, just one of them. So ctrl-F19 or Shift-F19 would work. It's not the same as just using the one key, but it's slightly better that you don't have to press four keys, just two. And if you use the Control key there's a good chance you won't bump into many other keyboard shortcuts. \n\nA: Yes, TextExpander has Scriptable Preference Settings.\nSo, to disable, using the shell:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"TextExpander\" to set expansion enabled to 0'\n\nTo enable:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"TextExpander\" to set expansion enabled to 1'\n\nThere are many preferences you can access or change via AppleScript: expansion enabled is a boolean flag controlling whether expansion (and capitalization correction) is enabled.\nKeyboard Maestro, Hammerspoon and skhd are some of the many options you have to create a toggle command (and bind it to a keyboard shortcut).\n", "Q: Firefox won't respond to force-quit On http://repl.it, I accidentally created an infinite loop in Python 3. I tried to close the tab, but Firefox already stopped responding. It wouldn't respond even after a while, so I force quitted FF. Then, I tried to reopen it, and it bounced for a while. It wouldn't reopen, so I force quitted and reopened again. Now, it is just sitting on my Dock with the little black \"open\" dot below it. Clicking on the icon does nothing.  \nHow can I fix this? (I hate Safari) I don't mind using Bash/Terminal, if it makes a difference. Also, it would be nice if it didn't reboot all my other apps as well, but if worst comes to worst, this is okay. Thanks!\n\nA: A few things you can try (ordered by \"assertiveness\"):\n\n\n*\n\n*Start with Command-Option-Escape to bring up the Force Quit dialog and see if it's there. If it is, force quit it (sounds like you've already tried this).\n\n*Open Terminal, and run ps -eaf | grep Firefox. If Firefox appears in the list (note that there will always be an entry for grep Firefox, this is not what you want, the actual Firefox will be listed as something like /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox), note the PID (the second column, a number), and run kill -9 <PID>.\nIf neither of these work, try restarting the Dock (maybe Firefox actually isn't running but the Dock is confused):\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the same ps -eaf | grep Dock.\n\n*There should be a process called /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock, note the PID and run kill <PID>.\n\n*The Dock should disappear momentarily and then restart.\n\n\nIf all this fails, easiest thing to do is probably just reboot your machine. If the usual shutdown dialog fails, press and hold the power button until the computer powers down.\n\nA: Ok so I had this, if you hit command option and escape, you can cut all power to it!!!

I quickly reopened the app. But instead of it resuming where I left off, the app had to load all over again. (This was Clash of Clans and I was in a raid!)\nIs there a way to keep an app open in the background?\nSuch a feature would also allow me to quickly check something and then return to the app that I was on.\n\nA: Apps are paused when backgrounded and resume when opened. If an app does not correctly resume to the state it was left in, this is something only the developer can fix.\nIt's not possible to run an app in the background as if it was in the foreground. Apps can only run a limited set of tasks in the background for a short period of time per Apple guidelines, or use structured backgrounding such as Background App Refresh.\nAlso see iOS 7 seems to be killing apps too often.\n\nA: If you're on iOS 9.0 - 9.1, you can jailbreak with PanGu. You can then install a tweak called Dissident in Cydia that enables backgrounding with different behaviors per-application.\n\nA: From  Background Refresh - How do I allow the app to run in the background?\n\nFor iOS Devices\nTo enable this, there are 2 options to check :\n1 - Low Power Mode (Settings App - > Battery - > Low Power Mode) needs\nto be off\n2 - Background App Refresh (Settings App -> Hushed - > Background App\nRefresh needs to be ON\nIf Background refresh is greyed out in the ON position, go To Settings\nApp - > General - > Background App Refresh - > Turn on the option for\nthe system, and then you can turn on / off by app.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to sync messages from Mac to iPhone?

I immediately installed OS X El Capitan (before it was Yosemite) and found that when I closed the lid, the Mac would not go to sleep anymore. Even testing in other user's accounts and after restarting, resetting NVRAM and SMC and even booting from a different hard disk (with OS X Lion installed), it won't go to sleep and also the little LED on the right will not light up, neither while booting nor when I close the lid.

Pressing space on a selected file in Finder evokes a preview window. Can I enlarge the size of this window by default to get a larger preview e.g. of images?\n\nA: This is answered over here, but basically you'll need to edit the \"QLPreviewHeight\" and \"QLPreviewWidth\" values in the Info.plist file inside the QuickLook plugin that handles images (you'll need select the plugin and choose \"Show Package Contents\" to get at the plist).\nYou can see your list of plugins with the command: qlmanage -m plugins\nIf qlmanage shows that \"public.images\" are handled by the built-in plugin (/System/Library/QuickLook/Image.qlgenerator), you shouldn't need to adjust dimensions since the window opens to the image's size by default. However if you do need to make changes, just copy the plugin into your directory (~/Library/QuickLook) and then edit it with Apple's XCode (downloadable from the App Store).\n\nA: You should be able to click/drag the corners of the Quick Look window.

It's handy for small JSON files, and I find it the easiest and most feature-full. It will highlight broken json, but it's not a 100% compatible validator like https://jsonlint.com/ because, for example, it treats raw tabs as valid within strings although this is not allowed by the JSON spec.\n\n\n*JSONMate seems to be a usable open-source project with an online editor which probably won't be able to handle large files, but you can fork it on github, adapt to your needs and run it locally.\n\n\n*Intellij Idea and derivatives have decent JSON support, but large files take time to load.\n\n\n*SublimeText is also usable for JSON if you install the plugins for beautifying and extra features.\nFor windows XMLMarker does a good job as an XML and JSON visualizer, but the last version which added JSON support is a limited trial.\nDisclaimer: I am not affiliated with any of these tools, authors or projects.\n\nA: Checkout Jason, although it appears to be no longer maintained since Osx 10.7, I just opened a JSON in it with Osx 10.11 and it works ok. \nPlease Note: since it is no longer maintained it is likely going to be unreliable. \nAlternatively, I have opted for an online browser-based JSON editor:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://jsoneditoronline.org/\nIt is surprisingly fast, allowing you to browse the tree, search values, edit values, insert values, reorder values, even duplicate values. You can even drag and drop stuff around to really get creative :) Unfortunately, you can't see the filename of the json you are editing, but you can open up new browser tabs for multiple json file editing at once.\n\nA: Just stumbled upon https://jsonviewer.app.\nNative, responsive, has tree view, works offline.\nNo tabs.\nWorks with large files with one big caveat – you can't open a file directly from the filesystem.

Often times I would like to move the page down but not as much as the \"Page Down\" keyboard key moves it. I would like to move it half the distance as it usual moves. I feel like I have experimented with every combination of \"Page Down\" with shift, option, control, command, and fn. Also, I used all those controls with the down arrow keys with no success.\nMaybe I missed something? Is this even possible?\n\nA: As answered in the question linked to by klanomath's comment, ControllerMate can be used to set up keybindings that simulate scrolling an arbitrary amount.\nHowever, this approach has limitations:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ControllerMate approach does not take into account the height of the window being scrolled; it advances a fixed distance on its virtual scroll wheel. So this workaround only works well if all the windows you wish to scroll are always the same height.\n\n*The default behavior of Page Up & Page Down, as well as Home and End, cannot be overridden in Chrome, at least. It only works if you add a modifier key. Being able to override existing single-key behavior is very desirable, since the whole point of this is to optimize something that is done very frequently.\n\n\n(Oops! I placed a bounty on this question worth 100 reputation points, not realizing that the points would be \"escrowed\" and that since I'm not a frequent user of apple.stackexchange.com, I would then not have enough reputation points to comment.

Hoping someone else can come up with an approach that overcomes the limitations mentioned above.)\n\nA: You cannot change this in macOS\nPage Up and Page Down are dynamic in that it automatically adjusts to the height of the window.\nIt will always scroll one page - if that page is 100 lines, it will scroll 100 lines, 10 lines, it will scroll 10 lines.\n\nA: I created AppleScript code in Script Editor:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key code 125\n    key code 125\n    key code 125\n    key code 125\nend tell\n\nThen from Accessibility > Dictation > Dictation Commands, I create a word and in the \"Perform\" drop down box select Run Workload, and select the AppleScript file using the code above that was created in Script Editor.\n", "Q: Windows 7 installation permanently operate as the only OS? If I download and install Windows 7 onto my MacBook Pro, will it permanently operate as Windows, or will I be able to switch between it and OS X? I am downloading Windows 7 strictly to operate Microsoft Flight Simulator X.\n\nA: Firstly, be sure to have a license for Windows 7, Windows operating systems are not \"free to be used\" as many Apple OSs.\nRegarding your question, you can install Windows 7 in a new partition of your disk driver in order to have the possibility to choose each time you boot the machine with OS to use. There are a lot of guides online and also in this community that can help you to proceed with the installation of a dual boot.\nYou can also install Windows 7 on the top of the OS X you are currently using. This will remove the Apple system and you'll be able to use only the Windows one. As a personal opinion, I don't think this is a good option (and I also think you don't want to use this option) because the MacBook Pro hardware is design to work with Apple operative system, therefore, you may have some bugs/problems when you'll use Windows. Anyway, for sure the performance of the machine will become worse.\nAnother possibility, is to use a virtual machine that work under OS X and simulate the Windows machine where you can install the software you are interesting to use.\nAgain as before, I don't think this is a good option knowing that the software you want to install required high performance.\n", "Q: El Capitan Mission Control: How to select an app with the keyboard?

But if I eject the drive (to dismount it), then Terminal can no longer see the Time Machine volume when I use the hdiutil command.\nUPDATE: I've tried the techniques on Garth Gillespie's blog and no issues were reported.

Most of the web pages that I found during searching were related to problems with sparsebundles that used FileVault.  \n\nA: Same issue here, I had to mount/unmount the sparsebundle volume before running hdiutil to compact it.\n\nA: Whilst not directly answering the question a related issue led me here, and maybe others might find this useful, but when I attempted to compact and image I got the following error:\nhdiutil: compact failed - Function not implemented\n\nIt turns out that hdiutil compact function is soft-disabled when the machine is running on battery power resulting in the above error. To override this behaviour add the following argument after the image name -batteryallowed when calling compact.\n\nA: I know I'm a bit late to this one, but if you're stuck with this issue you may want to start by checking that the volume with your disk image on it isn't full; you need a reasonable amount of free space or a lot of disk image functions will start to fail.\nOnce you encounter this error, you may also need to do a repair of the volume on the disk image itself; it may not actually be damaged, but you sometimes have to do this in order to clear the \"unmounted uncleanly\" status. I'm not sure why this is sometimes required and sometimes not, as it also might just clear on its own.\nBut if you do need to do it, then in Terminal you want to run:\nhdiutil attach -nomount /path/to/disk/image.sparsebundle\n\nOnce this has completed (you may need to enter a password) you'll get a listing for the contents like so:\n/dev/disk6              GUID_partition_scheme           \n/dev/disk6s1            EFI                             \n/dev/disk6s2            Apple_HFS\n\nYou can then run a repair on the correct partition (usually the last one), like so:\ndiskutil repairVolume disk6s2\n\nOnce this is complete you should be able to compact the image as normal.\n", "Q: Can I make a directory on OS X appear as a volume so I can backup using Super Duper?

For example the typographical apostrophe (’) now requires the full unicode (2019) rather than the original keyboard combination.\nThe question is: is there anything which allows me to easily enter unicode without losing the use of the option key for the rest?\n\nA: The question indicates the OP is not interested in using the Unicode Hex keyboard, but in case that solution does meet your needs, here is how to do it:\nOn macOS, you first need to add the alternate input \"Unicode Hex Input.\" In the System Preferences >> Keyboard >> Input Sources.\nOnce that is selected (by clicking that input source on the header bar, all you need to do is type the hex code while holding option.\nFor example:\nå =  ⌥ Option00e5\n\nA: I made a copy of Unicode Hex Input and added something to it that made the Press and Hold feature work with it.  So to put a diacritic on a letter, I hold the key down until a popup appears with the choices of accent marks.  But I can still use the hex value for glyphs not supported by that.\nUnfortunately, I can't remember exactly how and I can't find the SE posts that told me how to do it.  But if you want a copy, download https://HappyHobo.net/UHI+.tbz  It unpacks to UHI+.bundle which you can place into ~/Library/Keyboard\\ Layouts.  To add it to your input menu, you can find it in the English (not in \"Others\").\n\nA: Because the unicode keyboard uses ⌥a and ⌥e and ⌥c as part of the hex inputs, it can’t use them for the quick access to the accent keys, so there really is not way around this, however, switching keyboards is very simple. the first step is to simply add the Unicode HEX keyboard to your existing keyboard.\nYou can leave your keyboard in your normal language setting and hit ⌥⌘-space and type ⌥-2318, tr whatever combo you need, then swap back. This means you can still use ⌥e+e to type é, whilst still having rapid access to the full unicode set.\nIt sounds more complicated than it is, once you do it a few times it will become second nature.\nOn newer systems and newer keyboards, the keyboard switch may be tied to the  key.\nAnother option is to use Typinator (or perhaps some other  similar tool) to set a text expansion for something like ;<HEX> or ><HEX> to expand to the character. Since Typinator supports scripting, you should be able to take the <HEX> you enter, process it, and spit out the unicode character.\n\nA: I have written a solution which has worked well for some time.\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and create a new workflow. I called mine InputUnicode.\n\n*Check these settings:\n\n*\n\n*Workflow receives no input\n\n*any application\n\n*☑︎ Output replaces selected text\n\n\n\n*Add the Run JavaScript action.\n\nThe JavaScript is:\nfunction run(input, parameters) {\n    var app = Application.currentApplication()\n    app.includeStandardAdditions = true\n    \n    var input = app.displayDialog('Unicode HEX:', {\n        defaultAnswer: '',\n        withIcon: 'note',\n        buttons: ['Cancel', 'OK'],\n        defaultButton: 'OK'\n    }).textReturned\n\n    var text='';\n    input.split(' ').forEach(i=>{\n        text+=String.fromCodePoint(parseInt(i,16)||63);\n    });\n\n    return text;\n}\n\nI then assigned a universal shortcut ⌥⌘U:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences\n\n*Keyboard | Shortcuts\n\n*Services | InputUnicode (Same as above)\n\nThe workflow pops up an input box which allows you to enter one or more space-separated hex codes. These codes are converted into unicode characters, or question marks if not possible, and the result is inserted into the text.\nI wrote it in JavaScript because I understand it better than AppleScript, though the API documentation is pretty hard to find.\nAnnoyingly, the only application this doesn’t work with properly is Firefox, which doesn’t seem to handle the shortcut. However, you can still get to it through the Firefox | Services menu.\nUpdate\nI have now added this to Github: https://github.com/manngo/input-unicode.\nYou end up with a simple popup like this:\n\n", "Q: iMac: Running Hot with iSight camera turned on?

This sort of thing happens when I’m doing a lot of video work, but not on this occasion.\nI don’t think it’s overheating, but I would be interested in learning why it’s hotter. \nI did have the camera turned on to monitor things while I was away, using iCam Source. I am also using iGlasses to improve the image.\nSince turning iCam Source off, and hence the camera, the machine seems to be cooling down.\nThe question is: is it normal for the camera to heat up the Mac? Or should I look elsewhere for a cause?\nThanks\n\nA: It's normal that your laptop got heated that much. It's not because of the camera, actually. Even if you'll switch to external web-cam, you'll still have this effect.\nThe CPU is being heated because it has to process really heavy thread of video data, to encode and to process it on the flight. \nI have this effect on my laptop as well, especially on long skype meetings or when using other video processing.\n", "Q: Why do I have to verify payment when downloading a free app? I've downloaded free apps in the past without requiring verification. But now it makes me verify. Why? Can I turn this off?\n\nA: There are multiple reasons that this may happen.

If you go to iTunes and AppStore in settings, there will be an option to turn off verification for free apps. If credit cards are the cause, change the payment option to none and turn off family sharing.\n", "Q: Should I change my battery? I Have a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2009).

This approach will work and work well.\nI use an older MacBook showing \"Service Battery\" at home. It is always plugged into mains power. The computer works well and does everything my family need of it.\nAsk Apple for a Quote\nBefore buying a new laptop, ask Apple how much a new battery would cost. The cost will be significantly lower than a brand new computer.\nReplace the Battery Yourself\nAlternatively, iFix provide instructions for replacing the battery yourself but Apple do not recommend this. Apple do not recommend this because incorrectly fitted batteries can be dangerous and they can be a fire hazard.\n\nA: Yes, laptop will be still working.

Say, if accessing one.example.com should always bring up the tunnel, how can this be expressed with OnDemandRules? Or if two.example.com should always tear down the tunnel?\nThe Configuration Profile Key Reference states that the latter case could somewhat be handled by using a DomainAction with value NeverConnect that would \"never trigger a VPN connection attempt\". Which would be, although better than nothing, not exactly what I'm looking for – except that even this does not work as expected (if I've understood the documentation correctly):\n<key>OnDemandRules</key>\n<array>\n\n  <dict>\n    <key>Action</key>\n    <string>EvaluateConnection</string>\n    <key>ActionParameters</key>\n    <array>\n      <dict>\n        <key>DomainAction</key>\n        <string>NeverConnect</string>\n        <key>Domains</key>\n        <array>\n          <string>two.example.com</string>\n        </array>\n      </dict>\n    </array>\n  </dict>\n\n  <dict>\n    <key>URLStringProbe</key>\n    <string>http://a.url.that.returns.a.two.hundred.ok/</string>\n    <key>Action</key>\n    <string>Connect</string>\n  </dict>\n\n</array>\n\nMy understanding is that as the OnDemandRules array of dictionaries is evaluated at every connection attempt, and if the device is accessing two.example.com, the first dictionary would match and the tunnel would not be brought up. If the device is accessing another domain, for example one.example.com, the first dictionary would not match, the second dictionary would match, and the tunnel would be brought up. This does not work, however, and the tunnel is never brought up. If the order is switched and the Connect dictionary is on top then the tunnel is always brought up (including when accessing two.example.com).\nIs my understanding of the whole thing way off, or is Apple documentation or/and implementation somehow broken? Has anyone come up with OnDemandRules that can be used to selectively bring up or tear down a VPN connection based on the sites the device is accessing?\n\nEdit: The tunnel can be brought up \"by-domain\" by using the following rules (this assumes that there is no local resolver present):\n<key>OnDemandRules</key>\n<array>\n\n  <dict>\n    <key>Action</key>\n    <string>EvaluateConnection</string>\n    <key>ActionParameters</key>\n    <array>\n      <dict>\n        <key>RequiredDNSServers</key>\n        <array>\n          <string>127.0.0.1</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>DomainAction</key>\n        <string>ConnectIfNeeded</string>\n        <key>Domains</key>\n        <array>\n          <string>one.example.com</string>\n        </array>\n      </dict>\n    </array>\n    <key>URLStringProbe</key>\n    <string>http://a.url.that.returns.a.two.hundred.ok/</string>\n  </dict>\n\n  <dict>\n    <key>Action</key>\n    <string>Disconnect</string>\n  </dict>\n</array>\n\nThis however suffers from the fact that resolving the domain name first fails, causing the initial page load to fail in Safari. After a page reload the page is shown, and the tunnel is brought up. This happens even if instead of 127.0.0.1 a real, working behind-the-tunnel DNS server address is provided. Is there a way to not fail the initial lookup?\nAlso, the latter dictionary (Disconnect) is never reached, and the tunnel stays up for some time. How can I do the \"opposite\" of the above and tear down the tunnel for some domain names? The DomainAction of NeverConnect does not do this.\n\nA: \nThis however suffers from the fact that resolving the domain name first fails, causing the initial page load to fail in Safari.

I upgraded the RAM with 2x8 GB Kingston RAM with 1600 MHz, its a MacBook Pro late 2012 with i7.\n\nA: If you suspect hardware issues, you should run Apple Hardware Test. Make sure to run it multiple times because sometimes issues happen when the computer is hot.\nGenerally you should only start worrying if your Mac restarts often with panics.\n", "Q: Intel Mac Pro 1.1 stops responding after ~5 minutes If anyone could shed a little light on this, I'd be extremely grateful.\nI have a 2006 mac pro 1.1 (intel cpu) that consistently stops responding after 4-5 minutes.\nThe mouse still moves but nothing else responds, this applies for both the hard disk and the installer disk. The diagnostic LEDs aren't indicating anything out of the ordinary and while it works, the audio and network functions correctly.\nSo far I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting off original drive\n\n*Reinstalling on original drive (snow leopard disk, clean install)\n\n*Installing on new ssd drive (purchased for this machine)\n\n*Running boot with D and Option/Alt + D held for diagnostic mode (ignores command for diagnostics but accepts f12 to eject and C to boot from disc)\n\n*Checking each pair of ram cards on their own.\n\n*Testing each ram riser/riser slot combination with ram that I know works (tested in another server)\n\n\nContacting Apple with this data, I was told that the Mac and Snow Leopard OS are too old for Apple stores to deal with and only an apple certified repair centre would take them.\nIf anyone has any idea what might be wrong and how I can better narrow down the cause of this, then I'm all ears and will update with whatever subsequent tests are suggested.\n*For background: this machine will primaily be used for pulling cross platform libgdx code and compiling it for iOS.\nI had a hackintosh VM set up for it originally but wanted to have my compiled apps be 100% T&C compliant.\nAlso, this has been cross posted in Super User here: superuser.com/questions/1049421/\nI've been struggling with this machine each weekend for about 7 months now.*\nUpdate:\nAfter running Apple Hardware Test thanks to JMY1000's link and assistance, I'm now furnished with the error code: 4SNS/1/40000001:VMBS which a quick search narrows down to a sensor issue with:\n\n\n*\n\n*The RAM/Risers (which I can reasonably discount from the above tests)\n\n*The Graphics Card (Tested with another card, same error code)\n\n*Logic Board (Looks like this is the problem unfortunately.)\n\n\nUpdate 2:\nTested a different graphics card (same model) and the error code is the same. Looks like this is a logic board issue unfortunately.\n\nA: Run Apple Hardware Test either from a bootable volume or from the install CD that came with your Mac (You're using a generic Snow Leopard disk, which doesn't have AHT on it, since AHT is machine-specific). This should narrow down whatever issue you're having. You should be able to work from there.\n", "Q: Deleting a phone from iCloud In the manage storage section on my phone, if I delete the backup of another phone from my iCloud, will I lose the pictures currently on my phone that were taken from this other phone?\n\nA: The photos will remain on your current phone. You're only deleting the backup of a different phone and not affecting the phone you're using at all.\n", "Q: How to keep music in iCloud but not downloaded? I bought an album via iTunes on my Mac. On my iPhone, the album is not stored locally (I need a wireless connection in order to play it). However the album got downloaded onto my iPad automatically.\nHow can I remove the album from iPad? And of course not delete it from my library?\n\nA: On your iPad, go to Settings → General → Storage & iCloud Usage → Manage Storage → Music.\n\nFrom there, you can either Edit or directly swipe left on any artist to delete all their songs. If you just want to delete individual albums or songs, you can drill down by tapping an artist or album, respectively, then swipe left to delete each item one by one.\nIf you want to go thermonuclear, you can simply swipe left on All Songs. Do note that this operation takes some time to complete, up to several minutes. So just let iOS do its work, and soon enough you should have your storage back.\nOnce you’re done, in order to keep songs from being downloaded in the future, go back to Settings → iTunes & App Store, then toggle Music Off under AUTOMATIC DOWNLOADS.\n\n\nA: Keep the internet connection off and remove it. The album will be removed from your iPad and kept in the cloud.\n", "Q: Fullscreen App(s) In Splitscreen How can I use a fullscreen app (specifically a Keynote presentation) while displaying another app (specifically a movie) simultaneously?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't.\nApple's splitscreen simply doesn't currently support that. Unless the app specifically supports it's fullscreen mode in splitscreen, only the windowed mode will work (if it's supported there.)\nWith that said, you can export a Keynote presentation to another format like QuickTime which supports splitscreen playback. You can then run this in a window with a splitscreen, and the relevant other app (such as the movie) on the other side.\n", "Q: Scan USPS barcode from a Mac Is there any App that permits scanning barcodes?  An app that also supports UPS and Fedex would be useful.\nThe following search did not bring up any obvious results.  http://alternativeto.net/software/scan--qr-code-reader-/?platform=mac\n\nA: You can scan barcodes on the Mac with Delicious Library (available for free from https://delicious-monster.com/). You can use it to scan in the barcodes of your CD / DVD collection, but I don't know if it will read the barcode formats used by USPS/FedEx/UPS.\n\nA: You don't need an App to scan USPS barcodes.  There are plenty of apps out there that can do what you are looking for by integrating with a camera or your webcam, but I have found a purpose built scanner the best and most reliable solution.\n\nI use several from the Symbol line, and I have found this model quite excellent at scanning everything from shipping labels (FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, etc).  \nIt will also scan UPC (product) barcodes and ISBN (books and media) bar codes with no problem.\nYou don't need special software.  You can litterlly open Safari to the USPS website, scan the barcode and the numbers will be \"typed into\" the field you are on.  It works in any application.  I have used it in Word and Excel (Office 2011) on many occasions.\n\nA: The program EvoBarcode from evological scans barcodes using the webcam on a Mac. As far as I can see it supports the barcode type used by USPS (Code 128).\nhttp://www.evological.com/evobarcode.html\nThe program costs 30$, but they offer a free 15 day trial.\n", "Q: iphone 5c bluetooth pairing with Mac: \"the device does not have the necessary services\" As seen in the screenshot the iphone 5c is discovered via bluetooth; but the pairing is not successful due to missing services.\n\nThe Iphone says \n  My Devices\n       mellyrn     Not Connected\n\nwhere mellyrn is the hostname of the mac.   So what services are referred to here?\nI am on El Capitan.\n\nA: from what I've gathered, the \"services\" can be related to filesharing or simply because either one of the devices refuses to understand the other...\nbased on the following\n\niOs devices will not pair to computers except for Personal Hotspot. For AirDrop, you need to have bluetooth and Wifi on, and simply turn on Airdrop on each device. Pairing is not necessary.\n\nsource: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6795203?start=0&tstart=0\nit seems to use airdrop, the personal hotspot needs to be disabled\nand also \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Instead of connect to the devices using the \"Browse device\" where I have the same error than you, I went to \"Set Up Bluetooth Device\" and it works  \n  \n*went to preference- sharing- turned bluetooth sharing on \n  \n*bottom of options where you'll see \"Send File To Bluetooth Device\". The device may show as \"Disconnected\" but click on it anyway  \n  \n\nfrom https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4207524?start=15&tstart=0\nsee also  macworld co uk /how-to/mac-software/how-use-airdrop-on-macs-wirelessly-share-files-update-3500407/\nwhich basically says airdrop can be buggy - turn on wifi and bluetooth, open airdrop on mac and \"be patient\"\nin my case I got the same error message, but pairing/connecting wasn't working as I was using an iPhone 4s (and it needs 5 or later).\n\nA: I had a same issue and was getting a same error. \nProblem was my AirDrop setting in iPhone was \"Discoverable by Contacts only\" I changed to \"Everyone\" and it worked :)  \n", "Q: Boot problem on dual-boot MacBook Pro Can anyone help me restore the original boot 'order' on my Mac, using command-line? \nI wanted to install Ubuntu on my Macbook Pro Retina (early 2013), so I could run some specific software I needed for my work. I followed the instructions from this site: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-macbook-pro/\nI managed to install Ubuntu on a small partition on my HD, and then I performed 'efiboot fix', as suggested, so I could boot Ubuntu after restarting my Mac. I ran the following commands in Ubuntu: \nsudo apt-get install efibootmgr\nsudo efibootmgr\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0,80\n\nThen I restarted my Mac, but neither Ubuntu nor OS X could boot normally. Basically, I got a blank screen. I restarted again, holding the alt key, and then I was able to choose to boot OS X. \nCan I revert the boot order somehow, using Terminal commands in OS X? Really don't feel like experimenting again with Ubuntu. And can I remove this disk partition with Ubuntu now? I tried to do it through Disk Utility, but it's not possible. Any help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Since you can boot into OS X by holding down the Option key and selecting your OS X partition, you just need to set the Startup Partition in System Preferences.\nHow do I set OS X to boot by default?\nThis will be persistent across reboots.\n", "Q: What's the relationship between homebrew and xcode command line tools？ Are they the same thing? \nI was reading the \"homebrew-php\" github page, and it mentions about xcode and its command line tools. \nMy understanding about homebrew is it is a package manager like npm, why does it have anything to do with xcode, which I think doesn't have much to do with PHP.\n\nA: Homebrew doesn't include a compiler and other tools that would duplicate Apple's development tools. Instead of that - it just asks for you to get the basic tools from Apple.\nXcode uses the same tools under the hood as homebrew - so you could satisfy this specific requirement either by installing the command line tools directly or via an Xcode install.\nSo, they aren't the same thing and you need both for the brew package manager to run.\n", "Q: Need some basic enlightenment about using PHP Actually I have been programming in PHP for a while, but my experiences about PHP is through VPS or some local environment like XAMPP. \nI was trying to install xDebug/homebrew when I come across this \n\nIt says \"if you are on PHP 5.3\", only after reading this did I realize I already had PHP \"installed\" on my Mac（I think it comes with Mac OS) and this is where I got confused. I need something clarified:\n1）I have XAMPP on my Mac, does its PHP interfere with what comes with Mac?\n2) If I install Apache on my Mac, does it have its own PHP too? And after installing it, I will be able to use my Mac as a server right? What does this have to do with the server that is already running through XAMPP?\n3)Back to what I was doing (installing xDebug), I think I need to install xdebug on xampp's PHP, but following this instructio, it seems to me that I will only install it to Mac's PHP. If this is true, how do I install xDebug to XAMPP?\n\nA: *\n\n*To figure out whether you have several PHP installed, you may try to run from shell:\n$ which php -a\nIf you got one - then you are fine.\nIf you discovered, that the first line goes not the one which you installed, ensure that you are using the brew version, by placing /usr/local/bin before /usr/sbin in your PATH:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n\n*and questions #3: it seems you are confused. XAMPP already includes Apache, so you don't need to install anything separately. XAMPP is an Apache distribution containing MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. You may add xdebug to XAMPP package, by reading one of tutorials for OSX.\n", "Q: Mac randomly stopping Internet I'm really kind of clueless as to what is going on here, but it is really becoming frustrating. I haven't ever came across this issue on any other Macs, and it seems to be unique to me for some reason. So what happens is my computer will be connected to the internet and wifi just fine, and then sometimes my mac seems to have just randomly dropped connection to the internet. The wifi bars are all full, and the other computers in the house seem to be working fine during that period. However, for me I have to restart my computer to actually get the internet on the computer to begin working again, and it is ok once or twice but this occurs once or twice every day which is beginning to get frustrating.\nPlease Note: I am kind of confused about what could possibly  be going on, so I would be more than happy to provide information such as system logs, etc. But just ask.. I don't want to just dump potentially irrelevant information into the question.\n\nA: Good call on not dumping the kitchen sink. The first step is to run Network  Diagnostics - once when things work so you can see what it does and again when things are broken.\nIt will guide you through changes to make, so keep a short log of when you run it and what it has green/yellow/red and what changes are needed to fix each breakage.\nOver time, you'll probably find a pattern to one thing breaking and can ask a more narrow follow up question.\nTo run the tool:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Use the Go manu - Go to folder\n\n*paste in /System/Library/CoreServices/\n\n*Drag Network Diagnostics to your dock so it's easy to access\n\n\nYou can also use the \"assist me\" button in network settings - it's bottom right next to apply:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21585\n", "Q: Submit iOS app to app store on behalf of the team Me and my friend have developed an iOS app and we want to release it on App Store. Apple offers an Individual or Enterprise developer account which costs 199$. The problem is that we are not a legit company of any kind and we don't want to have any documents or registration. We jut want it to appear in App Store under our team name. An individual account is also not an option as we want us both to be mentioned as developers or none of us (just a team name). Is there a way to do it?\n\nA: No, there's no way to do that. You'll have to either create a company (which is quite easy most places) - or use one of your names with Apple. You can mention both your names in the description of your app if you want to.\nMost users probably couldn't care less who created the apps they're using. So in practice it is normally not a big deal to be listed as the developer or not.\n\nA: Apple used to allow an \"Artist Name\" that would allow any unique name to be the developer that appeared on the App Store. Now \"if you are an individual or sole proprietor/single person business, your personal legal name will be listed as the seller on the App Store.\" (from Apple Developer Support). Apple will also not allow any \"DBAs, Fictitious Businesses, Trade names, or branches\" to be registered under an organization/enterprise account. If you want your name as the developer, register as a company (which is not too hard to do) and use that name and the information of your company when opening a developer account. Then, you can open free developer accounts that can work inside that organization on iTunes Connect. If you and your friend are both under 18 and you do not want to create a company, the account must be registered under a parent or guardian's name. Then free developer accounts for you and your friend can be added. If you and/or your friend are over 18 you would have to use your name. Apple Developer Accounts only cost 99 USD/year now.\n", "Q: backing up my backups...what to backup? sorry about the facetious title...\nI am writing a script to backup my time machine backups in the event that my external HDD fails, and my HDD partition with the backups looks like this...\n\nMy question is, is it enough to just dump the 'latest' folder to my backup drive? Does that contain 'everything' that is o my latest system or only some revision of what changed in earlier backups?\n\nA: If you only want the latest backup, then yes - it is enough to just dump the latest folder to your extra backup drive.\nEach of those folders (the dates) contains the full backup as it looks on that day.\nNote that Time Machines saves space on the drive by using hard links to \"deduplicate\" the backup. This means that if you want to copy multiple dates to your extra backup drive, you'll probably want to handle hard links - otherwise the size of the backup will normally double for two days, triple for three days, etc.\nRemember: If you're only copying the latest date folder to your extra backup, you will not be able to restore files that were recently deleted, but stored in the folders representing earlier dates.\n", "Q: Where is my mbox located at?

It is detecting and I can also copy from my pen-drive to my Hard disk. But I cannot copy data from Hard disk to pen-drive. I tried with different pen-drives, but got the same result. \nWhat could be the reason for that? I have searched on web a lot but cannot know the reason.\nThanks in Advance ! \n\nA: The drive is probably NTFS, and OS X can't write to that. Either reformat it as FAT32/ExFAT using Disk Utility, or use an app like http://www.tuxera.com/products/tuxera-ntfs-for-mac/. \nThe current top-rated answer is incorrect about OS X not being able to write to FAT32 partitions. \n\nA: Follow these steps to format the USB drive to be able to copy files to it from a Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility app. The quickest way is search on Spotlight and click the result under TOP HITS. Alternatively, you can access it via Finder → Applications → Utilities → Disk Utility.\n\n*In the sidebar under External section, highlight your flash drive. Note: right below your device name, it also shows information about the drive e.g. size, file system, etc. In my case, I can see it's a 32 GB volume in MS-DOS(FAT) file system.\n\n*Now click the Erase button in the toolbar. In the new pop-up window, choose the format to be exFAT. You may also change the device name if you want. Then hit the Erase button to continue. Kind reminder: make sure you have backed up the data before you do this.\n\n*Wait until the erasing process to complete. It should be very quick (only a few seconds to format my 8 GB SanDisk drive).\n\n*This step is optional. I'm showing this to verify that the USB drive has been reformatted to the file system I wanted. I saved several files to the disk, and open Disk Utility again. And yes, it's now with the exFAT file system.\nSource:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.anysoftwaretools.com/format-usb-for-os-compatibility/\n\nA: OS X is not intended to do this out of the box, it doesn't work with FAT32 and NTFS, which are wide spread file systems on USB Stick Drives, especially on Windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*The solution which works like a charm for myself is to use Virtual Machine on Mac, with Windows 10 installed. I'm using Parallels Desktop, because of speed and tight integration with Mac. But there are also other options, alike VMWare or VirtualBox.\n\n*If you don't like the idea of having Windows virtualized, you may try to use standalone software, which is intended for mounting NTFS drives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Paragon NTFS for Mac\n\n*The chain of applications Fuse4x + Ntfs-3g, you may find instructions here.\n\n*NTFSFree for Mac OS X\nAs @NetherLinks outlined in the comments, FAT32 may also work on Windows, if you'll do the simple trick.

I need to restore files only. I dont remember was backupping setted up on previous machine. If setting it is necessary - how to do it? \n\nA: iOS has the option of backing up to iCloud.\nOS X can use iCloud Drive to maintain remote synchronised copies of some data. For everything else, you need to have been using Time Machine locally, or a paid online backup solution such as Backblaze for disaster recovery.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure these are active & up to date.\nWith no backup, then you need to be looking at data recovery solutions. Whether that is software such as Disk Drill or Data Rescue or a dedicated [& expensive] Data Recovery Service depends on the actual cause of the HD 'crash' & the value of the lost data.\n", "Q: i dropped my phone and now there are lines on the screen and i can't access the screen I had my phone in my pocket and it dropped on the tiles in my house. Now there are lines and I can't access the screen or get into my phone.\n\nA: You need to bring it to the repair shop, as the screen and sensor is damaged.\nProbably all other components are left intact, so you'll not loose your data, it's normally the screen is the most weak and fragile part.

Sometimes these disappear after a few minutes, but they are still very unsightly, and a bit worrying (is there something wrong with my screen?)\nI'm wondering if there are other cleaning techniques which avoid this issue, or whether this is completely normal behaviour.\nThank you!\n\nA: Two microfibre cloths, available from any supermarket.\nDon't get the 'smooth' ones specially for glass, they can be a bit hard on a plastic screen, get the 'fluffy' ones that make your fingers itch, like picking up tiny velcro.\nOne cloth completely wetted in lukewarm water [nothing else], then squeezed as dry as you possibly can [trick - fold in 4, then roll & wring. You really want it as dry as possible].\nThe other cloth totally dry.\nIf the screen is warm, you may need the first cloth very slightly wetter - but never anywhere near wet enough to dribble if squeezed - you really don't want any water that could run down the screen. The cloths work better when almost dry anyway.\nIf the screen is cold & also dark, i.e. computer off, you'll also find it much easier to see when it's clean.\nWipe the damp one gently over the screen, multiple times, turning the cloth, pay attention to the edges & corners.

Right now, when I need to check a word in the dictionary, I open Notes, type in something, select the word and hit \"Define...\"\nI'd like to directly type in a word and check something, similar to how I can just type stuff into Spotlight & look up definitions in OS X.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: This is currently not possible. Apple also forbids third party developers to create a simple wrapper around the dictionary, which means that there will probably not be any applications that do just that. There are, however, several other third party dictionaries which are quite good.\n\nA UIReferenceLibraryViewController object provides a dictionary service to look up the definition of a word or term from within an app. It should not be used to display wordlists, create a standalone dictionary app, or republish the content in any form.\n\nAccording to this answer Can iOS' builtin dictionary be accessed/browsed as an independent app? you can download the application DictionaryPlusPlus, which does just that, here https://github.com/josh-/DictionaryPlusPlus, it is open source and you will have to compile and sign it yourself.\n\nA: This is an old thread, but I think it's worth noting that Spotlight on iOS 11 has a built-in dictionary widget - you can type in any word and scroll down to see the dictionary. And Spotlight itself is accesible from any Home screen page.\n\nA: I use DictBox to see dictionary entries that I look up.  It is a multidictionary app, and also lets you see what the iOs dictionary says about the word.  I find the Apple dictionary to have the best definitions actually and the most excellent etymology included.

I previously had a Windows 7 32-bit installed on my Mac using Boot Camp Assistant. \nI recently upgraded it to Windows 10 (followed Microsoft update message), but later after I saw some drivers are missing I searched and found out that Boot Camp doesn't support 32-bit Windows 10. \nSo I tried to remove the whole thing from Boot Camp Assistant and reinstall a 64-bit windows 7. The Boot Camp Assistant said it cannot do it and I tried to delete the content myself from Disk Utility. After that I created a bootable thumb drive using Boot Camp Assistant, but it didn't restart the system automatically. So, I manually restarted and tried to reinstall Windows 7. It failed, but that is not my issue now. The problem is that I currently lost the Boot Camp partition and don't know what to do. I tried diskutil list and here's the picture:\n\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 yields:\n\nand sudo fdisk /dev/disk0: \n\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is EFI partition? is it part of Apple product or is it created when I tried to install windows? Should I get rid of it or not?\n\n*Why do I see two equal size 'Apple_Boot\" partitions? Is it possible that one belongs to the Boot Camp Windows that was on my system before?\n\n*I tried to install Windows on the 4th partition (as you can see), but got the message that said it's a GPT partition style. What is that and what should I do know?\nI cannot see this 100 GB partition in Disk Utility, so I can't do anything about it from there.\nMy system is MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012) on OS X El Capitan version 10.11.3 (15D21).\n\nUpdate 1:\nI want to (hopefully) have a Windows 7 64-bit on Boot Camp and get rid of all unnecessary partitions.\n\nUpdate 2:\nHere's what I see when try option key during startup. Also, when I restart my Mac now it goes to a grey screen with nothing in it and stays there. I suppose that is the EFI Boot doing because if I select it myself from the following screen the same thing happens.\n\n\nUpdate 3:\nI booted to the internal recovery partition and here are the results:\n\n\n*\n\n*The OS X Utilities is in version 1.0 (306).\n\n*The mount | grep disk0 on a Terminal window in the recovery partition yields:\n\nand the result of mount | grep disk0 on a Terminal window in the OS X (Macintosh HD) partition is:\n\n\nUpdate 4:\n\n\n*\n\n*I used update 4 of David Anderson's answer to eliminate the \"EFI Boot\" icon and unwanted booting to it which worked perfectly.\n\n*I followed update 5 and 1 to get rid of the two unwanted partitions (i.e. partitions 4 and 5 in my very first picture). It worked fine too.\n\n\nNow, diskutil list yields:\n\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 yields:\n\nand sudo fdisk /dev/disk0:\n\n\nUpdate 5:\nI tried to install Windows 7 64-bit again. This time when I got to the following option screen (after holding down the option key) I selected the Windows option;\n\nafter following the instructions I got to this page again to do the partitioning:\n\nhere I can see the missing unallocated space, but still doesn't let me install Windows on it and gives me the same message:\n\nI need to somehow make this unallocated space available for my Windows installation, but it seems to be still in gpt partition style.\n\nUpdate 6:\nWhen I tried to use Disk Utility to format the unallocated space to add a \"MS-DOS (FAT)\" formatted partition it turns out that it still doesn't show the unallocated space. It says that my Hard Drive is 750GB and the Mac partition is 650GB, but doesn't show the 100GB unallocated space:\n\n\nUpdate 7:\nI performed sudo  diskutil  resizevolume  /dev/disk0s2  R :\n\nI then tried to use Disk Utility's First Aid to repair and here's the result:\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 8:\nOk, after the resizing failed (Update 7), here's what I found and did:\nFirst I tried diskutil verifyvolume / on a Terminal:\n\nThen I tried diskutil repairvolume / which didn't work:\n\nSo, I switched to Recovery Partition and tried the same commands with slight change:\ndiskutil verifyvolume /dev/disk0s2\n\nand\ndiskutil repairvolume /dev/disk0s2\n\nand here's the results:\n\nIt seemed to have resolved the issues. I ran diskutil verifyvolume /dev/disk0s2 again just to be sure:\n\nAfter that I rebooted to Macintosh HD and tried diskutil resizvolume /dev/disk0s2 R again:\n\nAs it shows it did the job this time and now I have the whole 750GB back again.\nNow I need some instructions on how to do a BIOS/MBR install of Windows 7 without the aid of the Boot Camp Assistant (I'm still unsure why I need to do it without the aid of Boot Camp Assisstant though) and how to make sure that my firmware is up to date and that the USB Windows installer has the correct files.\n\nUpdate 9:\n\n\n*\n\n*I checked the firmware from here and it is up to date.\n\n*I created the USB Windows installer using Boot Camp Assisstant. I believe the Boot Camp Assisstant added all the Windows Support Software that I need.\n\n*Here are the command outputs:\nsudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0\n\ndiskutil list\n\n\nUpdate 10:\n\nI would not assume the \"Boot Camp Support Software\", you can download using the Boot Camp Assistant application, is the same as the Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621\" required for Windows 7. Although, for my (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) iMac, I happen to know they are the same.\n\nYou're right. They're NOT the same which is odd!\n\nIf you properly constructed your USB installer, you should be able to use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 7. Both my iMacs require installing using a DVD, so you are on you own here.\n\nI tried this a couple of times. The USB installer was construction went smoothly and the Boot Camp Assistant even partitioned my hard drive for installing windows, but every time when it got close to finish the installation, the system rebooted and couldn't complete the installation for some reason and moved to the page that it asks you to select between safe mode, etc, and no matter what you select, it gets the same error, restarts and comes back to the same page and ask again ...\nI used to look at How to install Windows using Boot Camp page to perform the installation which doesn't give you much info and now I can probably say sometimes misleads you. However, after you (see David Anderson's answer) mentioned the support softwares might not be the same, I checked and followed Install Windows 7 and earlier on your Mac using Boot Camp. In this instruction it specifically says to download and replace the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" which implies that the one that is downloaded by Boot Camp Assistant might not be the same as the one that is needed and in my case it wasn't (i.e. I needed the one you provided the link to in your update 9).\nFollowing the replacement of the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" on the USB installer, it took me only one attempt to successfully install Windows 7 64-bit on my Mac with absolutely no problem.\n\nA: Update 9\nGood news, your \"Recovery HD\" volume has the correct identifier of disk0s3. So there is nothing to fix.\nI would not assume the \"Boot Camp Support Software\", you can download using the Boot Camp Assistant application, is the same as the Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621\" required for Windows 7. Although, for my (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) iMac, I happen to know they are the same.\nIf you properly constructed your USB installer, you should be able to use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 7. Both my iMacs require installing using a DVD, so you are on you own here.\nIf you choose not to use the Boot Camp Assistant, the insert the USB installer and restart the computer. Hold down the alt/option key and select the icon labeled Windows. From the installer, you can reformat the BOOTCAMP partition NTFS. If the computer boots back to OS X, select the Windows partition from the Startup Disk panel in System Preferences. Click on \"Restart...\" to continue the installation of Windows. Once you have completed the Windows installation, but sure to install the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" stored the the USB drive. I believe the setup.exe application can be found in the BootCamp folder on the USB drive.\nUpdate 8\nYou repaired the file system on your \"Macintosh HD\" volume. This repair does not fix any files that may have been damaged while the HFS file system was corrupted. In cases like this, it may become necessary to backup your personal files (which may also be damaged), erase the entire disk and reload OS X.\nFor future reference, it is generally not a good idea to try to verify or repair a file system on the same volume that you have booted from. The computer basically is trying to verify or repair a file system that who knows how many programs are also read from and write to. The preferred method to verify or repair is to boot from a different volume. From your post, I see your probably already learned this. \nThe Apple site regarding firmware is About EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers.\nDo do not think you explained how you created the USB Windows installer. You were able to boot from a USB port so you must have done something right. I was questioning if you also included the Boot Camp Support Software on the same USB drive. This software for Windows 7 can be found at Install Windows 7 and earlier on your Mac using Boot Camp. These files need to placed on the drive per step 11 in the section titled \"Perform a new install of Windows 7\".\nI do not know why you should not try using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 7. The application does preform many of the a tedious steps involved in installing for you.\nIf you choose not to use the Boot Camp Assistant, then the next step would be to create a FAT formatted partition to hold Windows 7. This can be done using the Disk Assistant application as already explained in Update 7.\nUnfortunately, it would appear the command I wanted you to enter did not complete. The last image you posted shows the \"Recovery HD\" volume has the identifier of disk0s4. The correct value should have been disk0s3. Could you post the output from the command below, so I can verify this is not just false output from the command you entered.\nsudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0\n\nUpdate 6 and 7\nFrom the result of your Update 5, I can see you have successfully removed Windows from your Mac. The output you posted from the gpt command shows there is about 100 GB of free space on your internal drive. I can not find a way to make the El Capitan (OS X 10.11) Disk Utility application recover this space. This was not a problem with the previous versions of OS X. Fortunately, the command line version still seems to work. Enter the following command in a Terminal application window. Before entering the command, I would make sure the Disk Utility application is not currently running.\nsudo  diskutil  resizevolume  /dev/disk0s2  R\n\nIf successful, the missing 100 GB should be added back to your \"Macintosh HD\" volume. If not, let me know and I will post an alternative solution. \nI assume you now what to do a BIOS/MBR install of Windows 7 without the aid of the Boot Camp Assistant. I assume you made sure your firmware is up to date and that the USB Windows installer contains the correct files. \nThe reason you received an error message, during your latest attempt to install Windows, is because your MBR table is configured as a Protective Master Boot Record (PMBR) table. A PMBR table is defined as having a single partition of type EE that spans the entire disk except for the MBR itself. The command fdisk shows your disk contains 1465149168 sectors (blocks). The MBR resides in first sector starting at index 0. The EE partition resides in the remaining 1465149167 sectors. The purpose of a PMBR table is to prevent legacy software from accidentally modifying your MBR partition table. The occurrence of a PMBR also indicates to modern software that you have a GPT.\n\nThe cylinder (cyl), head (hd) and sector (sec) columns in the MBR table are no longer used to represent the geometry of the disk (drive). Most of the time, the values stored are just made up and therefore ignored. The EFI specification does give default values for the type EE partition, but I believe Apple and Microsoft ignore these values.\n\nTo install Windows in BIOS/MBR mode, you need a FAT or NTFS formatted partition stored in the fourth partition in the MBR table. Since OS X can not format a partition as NTFS, you will have to settle for a FAT format. The easiest way to create such a partition is with the Disk Utility. Below is an example using a 100 GB disk image. You will need to apply the same steps using your internal drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the drive.\n\n*Click on the button labeled Partition. A window similar to what is\nshown below should appear. \n\n\n*Make the appropriate adjustments to create a \"MS-DOS (FAT)\"\npartition. This is where you are going to install Windows. Below is\na proposed new 20 GB partition.\n\nMake sure you still have your original \"Macintosh HD\" partition, as\nshown below, then click the \"Apply\" button.\n\n\n*Your results should be similar to the image shown below.\n\nThe creation of this new partition should populate your MBR table. When installing Windows, you will be able to reformat this \"BOOTCAMP\" partition as NTFS.\nNote: To add partitions to the MBR requires reducing the size of the protective type EE partition to end at the same sector (block) as the EFI partition in the GPT. Any additional MBR partitions will also be mirrored in the GPT. One consequence, of reducing the size of the EE partition, is some lost of a PMBR. Legacy software now has the opportunity to incorrectly partition your drive. The Windows operating system falls into the category of this legacy software. Therefore, it is important you do not change the drive partitioning using any software provided by Microsoft. However, it is OK to format partitions.\nOne final note. Resizing a volume that is currently set as the computer's startup disk may invalidate that setting. Since this is your startup volume, you can eliminate this possibility by following the steps below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Open the Startup Disk panel.\n\n*If necessary, click on the lock to make changes.\n\n*Click on the icon labeled \"Macintosh HD\" to highlight it.\n\n*Quit System Preferences.\n\n\nBelow is an image of my highlight El Capitan startup disk highlighted.\n\nBy the way, as some point during a Windows installation, your computer may boot back to OS X. If if does, return to this Startup Disk panel and highlight the Windows disk, then select \"Restart...\". Your Windows installation will continue.\nUpdate 5:\nHere is the link to \"Create a bootable installer for OS X\". \nTo Download the OS X installer from the Mac App Store, do the following. Open the \"App Store\" application and enter \"el capitan\" in the search box. The resulting window should appear similar to the image shown below.\n \nClick on the \"DOWNLOAD\" button below the title \"OS X El Capitan\". Follow the instructions to start the download.\n\nNote: You can enlarge an image by clicking on it. Or, you can open the image in a new window.\n\nYou will need a 8 GB or larger USB flash drive. Before entering the command\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\nyou should initialize your flash drive. The steps are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the flash drive into a USB port.\n\n*Open the \"Disk Utility\" application.\n\n*Highlight the icon representing the flash drive media.\n\n*Select the icon labeled \"Erase\".\n\n*Configure for a single visible partition be setting \"Name:\",\n\"Format:\" and \"Scheme:\" as shown below.\n\n\n*Click on the \"Erase\" button.\n\n*When finished, quit the \"Disk Utility\" application.\n\n\nUpdate 4:\nYou probably can eliminate the icon labeled \"EFI Boot\", shown in your Update 2, by following the instructions, in the section titled \"Chasing Ghosts\", given at this link.\nUpdate 3:\nAccording to Apple web site Computers that can be upgraded to use OS X Internet Recovery, MacBook Pros have be able to use OS X Internet Recovery since 2010. Granted, a firmware upgrade may be needed, but I do not think this applies to your MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012) model.\nUpdate 2:\nOn my Mac, I can not use the gpt command to edit the GPT on a disk, while booted from a partition on the same disk. I assume you will have the same problem, if you boot to a recovery partition on your Macs internal disk. One solution would be to boot from a USB flash drive and then enter the diskutil and gpt commands. \nOne way to create this USB flash drive would be to download and execute the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant v1.0. Unfortunately, this software only works with Lion through Yosemite. El Capitan can still boot to Recovery Mode from a USB flash drive, but the software download, needed to create this flash drive, exceeds 6 GB. Basically, you download and transfer to a USB flash drive all the software needed to boot to Recovery Mode and install the current version of El Capitan. Of course, all you need is to boot to Recovery Mode. You do not need to reinstall El Capitan. \nAlso, from System Preferences, select Start Up Disk. Highlight your OS X boot partition (Macintosh HD) and restart the computer. This should fix your boot problem.\nBefore executing the steps in Update 1, do the following. Boot to your internal recovery partition. From the menu bar, select \"OS X Utilities\" and then \"About OS X Utilities\". Copy down the version number and post it for me to read.  \nNext, open a Terminal application window. Enter the following command and post the results.\nmount  |  grep  disk0\n\nThis will tell me which recovery partition you are booting from. Would not want you to delete the wrong one.\nUpdate 1:\nI assume the second recovery partition is not needed. If you want to check, you can try booting from both first. If successful, then it is probably safe to remove the second one. To boot from a recovery partition, restart the computer and hold down the alt/option key. Select an icon to choose the partition to boot from.\nTo remove the unneeded partitions, you need to boot from internet recovery. The instructions are given at the site OS X: About OS X Recovery. Once you are in internet recovery, open a Terminal application window and enter the following commands.\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk0\ngpt  remove  -i  4  /dev/disk0\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk0\ngpt remove  -i  5  /dev/disk0\n\nThis should return the computer to a state where the Boot Camp Assistant can be used to install Windows. If you fail, we can discuss other means to install Windows.\nAnswers to Questions\nAnswer to question 1:\nThe hidden EFI partition was created when OS X was installed. The Mac does not use this partition to boot OS X. It is used by OS X when you upgrade the firmware or format a different partition. Do not remove this partition. The partition is used if you install Linux or install Windows using the EFI/GPT boot method. This method is suppose to work if installing Windows 10. It is not suppose to work if installing Windows 7. Windows 7 is suppose to be installed using the legacy BIOS/MBR method.\nAnswer to question 2:\nThe Apple_Boot partitions are hidden recovery partitions. There should only be one on your computer per OS X installation. The recovery partition should always be next partition after the OS X partition. Neither belong to Boot Camp. My guess would be you removed an older OS X partition and did not remove the hidden recovery partition. You boot to a recovery partition by holding down the alt/option key at startup. Icons will appear allowing you to select a recovery partition to boot to. Recovery partitions have may uses such as reinstalling or repairing your current OS X installation. Since you have a newer Mac, you can also boot to recovery mode directly over the internet.\nAnswer to question 3.\nWhen installing Windows 7, you have to choose either partition 2, 3, or 4. If you have a recovery partition and are using the Boot Camp Assistant, you are limited to only the 4th partition. While it is possible to manually install to a partition greater than 4, the amount of grief involved makes it not worth bothering to try. \nThere are two partition tables stored on the drive. One is the legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table and the second is the GUID Partition Table (GPT) where GUID stands for Globally Unique Identifier. OS X uses the GPT and Windows 7 uses the MBR partition table. You have posted the partitions on your drive as seen by only looking at the GPT. \nIf you have a FAT or NTFS formatted partition, then the legacy MBR partition table needs to be updated to reflect this. I suspect this did not happen or the values are wrong. The message \"it's a GPT partition style\" was generated because the Windows 7 installer sees your drive as having a GPT format. \nUsually, the Disk Utility and/or the Boot Camp Assistance will make the proper changes to the MBR partition table when a FAT formatted partition is created. Note, the GPT can hold 120 entries while the MBR partition table can only hold 4 entries. Once the proper entries are made to the MBR partition table, Windows and its installer will see the drive as only having a MBR partition scheme.\nFrom my experience, the Boot Camp Assistant will not work properly while the 5th partition exists on your drive.\nBeyond answering your questions, you need to enter the following commands at a Terminal application window. Edit your question to post the results. If prompted, enter your login password. None of these commands will change your computer. The commands will print out most of the contents of the both partition tables.\nsudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0\nsudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0\n\n", "Q: Connecting to password protected AFP server from terminal?

If you are using a specializied commercial, industry, or military vehicle that works on a 24volt system (you will know if it does or not) then the first adapter is the one that you need to use.\nHowever...\nI would not use either of these.  3rd party power adapters are notorious for being of poor quality and could be dangerous to not just your Mac, but to you as well.  If this is for your car, I recommend getting  a DC power inverter and a GENUINE Apple Power Adapter\nYou are connecting an Apple laptop worth thousands to a $30 adapter....to me, it's just not worth the risk.  The second benefit is that you will have standard AC power outlets, meaning you can use them for just about anything you would plug into your home.\n", "Q: Why can't Spotlight find an application I know is there? I have this application called Cura Type A, but Spotlight cannot find it, even when I show all results in Finder... Anyone know why?\n\n\nA: It is quite possible that your Spotlight index is damaged or incomplete. The app does launch and function correctly, right? If so try rebuilding the Spotlight index.\nLaunch System Preferences, Click on Spotlight and then click the Privacy tab. Drag your HD icon into this window. Click OK when asked to confirm.\nOther housekeeping utilities (like Onyx) will also rebuild the Spotlight index.\n\nA: From https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201716\nIf searching your Mac doesn’t return expected results, rebuilding the Spotlight index might help.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu () > System Preferences, then click Spotlight.\nClick the Privacy tab.\n\n*Drag the folder or disk that you want to index again to the list of locations that Spotlight is prevented from searching. Or click the Add (+) button and select the folder or disk to add.\n\n\n*\n\n*To add an item to the Privacy tab, you must have ownership permissions for that item. To learn about permissions, choose Help from the Finder menu bar, then search for “permissions.”\n\n\n*From the same list of locations, select the folder or disk that you just added. Then click the Remove (–) button to remove it from the list.\n\n*Quit System Preferences. Spotlight will reindex the contents of the folder or disk.\n\nA: Before rebuilding or anything make sure Spotlight is searching the correct directory or filetype.  Open System Preferences and click on Spotlight. The window that opens lets you define certain aspects of spotlight search.\n", "Q: Partially installed app stuck and cannot be unistalled After updating my iPad 3 to the latest version of iOS (9.2.1 I think, this was in February 2016) one of my apps needed to be updated. It partially installed then got stuck with the status graphic about 50%. After a day or two I tried to delete it and despite me acknowledging the warning \"this will also delete the app's data\" nothing happened.\nSo I'm stuck with an app that's not installed and can't be removed. And I still get notifications from the app, but listed as some generic notification type.\nHow can I remedy this?\n\nA: The way to solve it at Apple Discussions:\nTry deleting the waiting icons - tap and hold down on an icon until it wiggles - the tap the X on the icon to delete it. Then try to download again. Try swiping across the progress bar as well.\nReboot the iPad by holding down on the sleep and home buttons at the same time for about 10-15 seconds until the Apple Logo appears - ignore the red slider - let go of the buttons.\nMake sure that you do not have a stalled download in iTunes - a song or podcast.  if you have a download in there that did not finish, complete that one first. Only one thing can download at a time on the iPad so that could be what is causing the problem.\nIf that doesn't work - sign out of your account, restart the iPad and then sign in again.\nSettings>iTunes & App Store>Apple ID. Tap your ID and sign out. Restart the iPad by holding down on the sleep button until the red slider appears and then slide to shut off. To power up hold the sleep button until the Apple logo appears and let go of the button.\nGo back to Settings>iTunes & App Store>Sign in and then try to update again. Tap one waiting icon only if necessary to start the download stream.\n", "Q: Getting all versions of a file from a Time Machine backup I have 2 terabytes worth of TM backups on my external hard drive and I need all versions of a specific folder (more specifically, all the files from that folder).\nIs it possible to extract all backups of a folder from my backup without going through all the days with backups and extracting them manually?\n\nA: If you are a bit familiar with the terminal, it is quite easy.\nOpen the terminal and cd to the location of your backups on your backup hard drive.\nThen, you copy all versions of the folder you are interested in into a new folder with rsync.\nI'm making up an example where you want to copy all versions of the folder /Users/peter/Documents/thesis/ into a new folder ~/all_my_versions that is located in your home folder.\nYou will have to adapt the paths to your system, e.g. by replacing Macintosh\\ HD with the name of your harddrive.\n# create new folder\nmkdir ~/all_my_versions/\n# change directory to your backups\ncd /Volumes/Backup_HD/Backups.backupdb/My_MacBook_Pro/\n# run for loop to copy all folders into newly created directory\nfor F in *\n do\n  rsync -avz $F/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/peter/Documents/thesis ~/all_my_versions/$F\n done\n\nIn the end, the folder ~/all_my_versions will contain several subfolders, whose names are the backup dates and times:\n2015-10-19-113849/\n2015-10-28-111812/\n2015-11-04-104802/\n\n\nA: There's a tool to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup Loupe\nIt lets you browse specific files and extract when they changed.

For no apparent reason, my OS X 10.9.5 Finder has gone haywire. Whenever I create a new Finder window, the main panel, where the files/folders are usually shown, just shows whatever is beneath it, as if there's nothing there. If you drag any other window over the Finder window, that panel will take on the pixels from the other window -- basically the panel is not drawing itself at all.\nSee screen shot below. It's all greyed out because that's the overlay from the screen shot functionality -- if you look closely you can see how the background is showing through. \nI have no idea how or why this happened. I can't think of anything that triggered it. Any idea how to fix this?\nClue 1: rooting the machine doesn't fix it. But resetting the NVRAM does -- at least immediately. After a few minutes of use after the NVRAM reset, the problem reappears.\nClue 2: Icons and Cover Flow view modes work normally. List and Columns view modes do not -- i.e. they show the behavior noted above.\n\n\nA: The problem is solved by changing the preferences of Google Drive:\nClick the Google Drive menu and choose Preferences.\nUncheck the option to “Show file sync status icons and right click menu” in the Preferences/Advanced window.\nMore info following links from ConvexMartian above.\n", "Q: iMac Aluminum Housing Not sure if these kinds of questions are allowed here, but I would like to know how Apple machines the little Apple logo cutout on the bottom of the front iMac panel /housing. It looks like it could be alien technology.\nI'm a machinist and wonder how the black material inside the logo cutout is housed in the aluminum and whether that machining is EDM or laser cut. \n\nA: EDM doesn't nearly give the same yield and precision compared to laser.\nEDM skimming probably get the job done nice and accurately, but it will cost just too much time.\nObviously the internals of the iMac / Macbook unibody frame are being done by traditional mill-cut CNC.  It does take a while before a frame exits the machine, but Apple just has an awful lot of them in the factory. No rocket science here.\nThe Apple logos (front and back of the iMac, screen lid of the Macbooks) are probably done by laser cutting.  To get higher yield, they might use high pressure waterjets (possibly assisted with garnet and/or alox) for the middle, and laser for the outer edges.\nNot your question but nonetheless interesting, the breathing light on MBP's, the LED non-hole next to the Macbook's iSight camera/external touchpad/keyboard are done by high precision laser technology (0.001\" and below) with machinery sourced from an external company which owns the technology behind it.\n\nA: It is most likely a metalized and chromed plastic decal.  More than likely it's pattern is stamped then applied to to the aluminum housing.  I have seen these peel off at the hands of children.\n", "Q: free alternative to DVDFab for OS X? so I'm wondering if there's a free alternative to DVDFab. I mainly want to make unencrypted backups (to ISO file) of my DVDs. and in some instances, I want to shrink the DVDs from DVD9 to DVD5 size.\nThanks :)\nps. I've looked around the net and no --recent-- discussion on this topic.\n\nA: Handbrake is a great free utility for ripping DVDs. It does require the free libdvdcss but the first time you try and rip an encrypted DVD Handbrake will prompt you to download and install it. It's pretty easy.\nThat will get you a movie file of your choice but not an .iso. There are apps that will do that. iMovie, iDVD, Toast, etc. will all take a movie file and burn it to a DVD or .iso\n", "Q: Alias to folder on external hard drive disappears from sidebar when the hard drive is ejected I've made an alias to a folder on my external hard drive and added it to Finder's sidebar.

Around 5gb is what my other space is taking up on my iPhone 6. I see this in iTunes when I hook my phone up to the computer. So I can't install more apps and I want to. How can I mend this, how can I delete this other space. I am sure I am not actively using 5gb of space. Most of the photos I uplpoad to facebook, and I doubt my saved games take up so much space. Which program can I use or something like that?\n\nA: First of all, you should know exactly what is the \"Other\". Because there are just too many things that require physical storage in iPhone. That's why Apple chose to lump a lot of things into the \"Other\" category. If there is many \"other\" storage on your iPhone 6, it's seems like your phone is filled with cached files and data. That can include: \n\n\n*\n\n*Documents & Data \n\n*Safari browsing data \n\n*Mail data \n\n*iTunes data, including files that have been streamed (which can be BIG).\n\n\nDeleting data, and then restoring is a good way, but you should back up first. or it will cause data lost. So it will take a little risk. Have you updated the application on your iPhone or upgraded iOS system to the newest version available? Some similar problems have been resolved using this way. If above ways still not work, you can choose some professional tools. You can try iMyfone Umate. It claims that this tool can optimize storage space and reduce the storage space occupied by apps to free up iPhone space. Maybe it's useful.\n\nA: Try using battery pro app, see if that will help clearing up your space. Should do the work at least somewhat.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro fuzzy screen and freezes on startup at the Apple logo with half progress bar Details: MacBook Pro 2011, El Capitan.\nIssue: As mentioned above in the subject.

Any help appreciated as it surely cannot be this inflexible.\n\nA: Your Apple ID is not your email address… it it your AppleID. \nThat never changes.\nIt doesn't even have to be an email address, strictly speaking.\nIf you change the primary email address associated with it, that doesn't change the AppleID you sign in with - so if it used to be fred@xyz.com with a password of 123 & you changed the primary email address to fred@abc.net…  \n...you still sign in as fred@xyz.com, password 123\nyet if Apple ever need to write to you, they'll write to fred@abc.net\n", "Q: How to share an iTunes library between Mac & Windows? i have two SSDs and one HDD in my computer. One SSD runs OS X and one SSD runs Windows. On the HDD i have my iTunes Library and Music Files. I want to use the same library on both OSs.\nI used this guide to get write permissions on the NTFS HDD over Mac OS: NTFS support on El Capitan\nI now have the problem that Mac OS searches music in the path:\nfile://localhost/D:/Music/\n\nWhile it is (within Mac OS) in the path: \nfile:///Volumes/DATA/Music/\n\nWhich options do i have to solve this problem? \nI already read about OS X Fuse but im confused if this is the tool that can help me.\n\nA: Getting both Mac & Windows able to read & write to the same location is just the beginning… [& frankly, the simplest method is probably to just format the shared drive as exFAT, which both Mac & Windows can read & write to natively.]\n\"Sharing the library\" is something of a misnomer when it comes to manually keeping one iTunes Media folder synchronised between two different machines & two different iTunes instances.\nYou can do it, but each copy of iTunes will want to be \"in charge\" & they will not auto-synchronise at all. You would have to do that manually, every so often. It is not a quick task, but it can be done.  \nThe first thing to do is establish which will be your Master & which your Slave.\nIt is going to be very counter-productive if you keep adding tunes & playlists to both iTunes, as you will then never be able to synchronise them. One has to be \"in charge\" the other merely a copy.  \nI'm going to assume we're using the Mac as Master, Windows as Slave.\nNote: You are not going to be moving the default iTunes folder on either OS, only the Media folder location. You cannot make iTunes synchronise the main folder across what is essentially two machines.\nNext, you need to establish what the full path to each is, from each OS.\nAs you've already discovered, the paths are absolute, not relative - so the next thing to do is take your Master iTunes Library.xml file & modify all the paths so that it will work on your Slave iTunes.\nAssuming your stated paths are correct for each instance, then you need to take your Master xml file, duplicate it & search/replace the paths to match your Slave paths. Something like TextWrangler [freeware] is going to be good for this.\nOpen your Mac iTunes folder & copy the iTunes Library.xml file to the desktop. This is going to be our working copy of the Mac Master which we will modify & move to Windows. Leave the original where it is.\nOpen this duplicate Master iTunes Library.xml & scroll down until you find the first path instance, check it's correct - so, for instance your Mac path would be file:///Volumes/DATA/Music/ so in Search menu > Find…  put file:///Volumes/DATA/Music/ in find & file://localhost/D:/Music/ in replace.\nReplace all.\nIn your Slave iTunes folder, move the existing iTunes Library.xml & iTunes Library.itl files to the desktop, for safety.  \nCopy across your newly-modified .xml file to your Windows iTunes folder.\nDon't launch iTunes yet.\nImportant Note\niTunes behaviour appears to have changed at approximately version 12.3\nYou can no longer break the .itl file & use that as your base to rebuild. iTunes now just claims it is damaged & will not use it.\n\npost 12.3 method\nCopy your newly-edited iTunes Library.xml to your Windows music/iTunes folder & your existing, unmodified iTunes Library.itl file directly from your Mac iTunes folder to your Windows folder, replacing the existing one, if it's still there.\nLaunch iTunes.\nOpen the prefs  Ctrl ⌃   ,  go to the Advanced tab & first switch off 'keep organised' & 'copy to iTunes media folder'.\nThen change the path to the correct one for your remote media folder location.\nClick OK - if you are asked anything about 'should I organise/fix/etc' say no.\niTunes will do a quick 'Updating Library' & then you appear to be ready to go [I'm doing this live as I'm typing this answer…]\nThis method no longer appears to preserve the album artwork & instead iTunes will need to go fetch it all again, rather annoyingly.\nAs of iTunes 12.6 Album Artwork & play counts are once more preserved.\nIt runs like molasses whilst this is happening… but seems to be good once finished.\n\npre 12.3 method \nThis is the important bit that none of the 'moving my iTunes Library' guides tell you. They mostly tell you to Import this new XML from the Import menu - I've done it, it can take 12 hours & you lose some data.\nInstead, we will make a new broken ITL file.\nAs I don't know how to do this on Windows, lets make one on the Mac & copy it over.\nOpen Terminal & enter this touch ~/Desktop/iTunes\\ Library.itl That will create an empty ITL file on the desktop, broken enough for this.\nMove this file to your Windows iTunes folder.\nLaunch iTunes. It will now notice something is 'wrong' & start rebuilding the ITL file, using your newly-modified XML file. The message is 'Importing ‘iTunes Music Library.xml’ This will take some time, but more like 15 minutes than 8 hours.\nYou may find some album artwork missing - it never seems to be a truly perfect solution, but your play counts, playlists etc should all survive intact.\n\nYou need to repeat this entire process every so often, to maintain sync between the two instances. You will always lose the play counts, etc from the Windows instance this way, but that's as close as you are going to get to fully synchronising iTunes.\n", "Q: How to install certificates with Mono on Rootless El Capitan As follow up question for this post:\nHow do I install global certificates on a Rootless El Capitan for mono?\nMono uses the path /usr/share/.mono/certs, which isn't allowed anymore (see refered post).\nDoes someone knows where I could store those certificates other then ~/.config/.mono/certs?\nIt is not a problem for us to install the certificates in the config folder, but it is a minor annoyance, because all new users on those devices will have to run the installer, instead of only the first user.\n\nA: Although this post is quite old, maybe an answer is still helpful.\nMono's new cert-sync might help:\nhttp://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/releases/3.12.0/#cert-sync\n\nMono users on Linux no longer need to run mozroots to get SSL working.

I was out trying to find a good system monitor application and decided to give a shot to Monity, which has gotten several good reviews from respectable journals. \nWhat bothers me is that the application that comes from the App Store is only a portion of the software. The software asks for download of a so-called Helper App for free, in order to get additional panel (which would be what I am after essentially). \nThere is little to no documentation why this helper app is required and the fact the fact that a portion of the software doesn't go through Apple's control doesn't give me any good vibes. \nI know that Apple has certain hinders that prevent developers to reach system resources, but in most cases I have seen at least some explanation to what the helper contains by the developer. In this case there is no information on the dev homepage and I didn't get a reply to my email to the developer. \nSo the question is: What specific controls do apps go before they are on App Store? In other words, why would a dev choose not to deploy his/her program (or parts of it) on the App Store? \n\nA: All applications sold through Mac App Store have to be sandboxed. Being in a sandbox restricts what the application can do quite a lot. For example they can not access files in folders to which you did not grant them access explicitly via the system Open File dialog. The complete sandbox documentation can be found on the Apple Developer pages, but the important thing to note is that it is very restrictive. \nHaving a system tool that can live in it is near impossible. Also note that Apple itself does \"cheat\" when it comes to the sandbox rule. For example the XCode is accessible via Mac App Store but it is not sandboxed (because it wouldn't work if it were). \nIn general though, sandboxing is a good thing. The only way to be really sure if an app is behaving well or not is to see if there were complaints or signs that the developer can not be trusted. Note, however, that before the Mac App Store existed all applications were distributed via other channels and most of the time things went fine.\n", "Q: Separate mouse and trackpad settings with Karabiner This post (which is upvoted 26 times as of this writing) suggests using Karabiner to set separate scroll settings for a USB mouse and the laptop trackpad.\nKarabiner seems to be a nice application, and I understand the suggested solution (don't remap trackpad settings, then reverse scroll settings on all pointing devices except previously excluded ones) but it doesn't work in my case because the USB mouse IS an Apple pointing device (it's an apple USB mouse). \nThere is an option \"Don't remap an internal keyboard\" but nothing about \"internal trackpad\".

But typing in \"Smoothies\" into Spotlight shows the desired message.\nHow can I get Mail.app to search correctly?\nI'm running Mac OS X 10.11.3.\n\nA: This helped me - it allows unrestricted spotlight search - and, after executing that command, mail search and smart mailboxes worked again\nOpen terminal from the utilities folder and execute:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.appsandbox \\\n    UnrestrictSpotlightContainerScope -bool true\n\n\nA: for years I had this problem (on and off) and tried everything I could find.\nFinally I found this: for some reason indexing was turned off and I had to 'switch it on' with sudo mdutil -a -i on\nAfter that mail search immediately worked.\nHope this will make a few people less frustrated with mail (like I was)\n\nA: Rebuilding Mail.app's mailboxes fixed this for me. This ComputerWorld article is a great reference for rebuilding and reindexing your mailboxes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebuild: Select a mailbox (or several by shift-clicking) and then use \"Mailbox > Rebuild\"\n\n*Reindex: Quit Mail, navigate to ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData (on Mac OS 10.12 - Sierra, ~/Library/Mail/V4/MailData) and delete any files where the name begins with Envelope Index. Mail will rebuild the indexes on the next start (which may take a long time depending on the size of your mailboxes)\n\n\nA: I just migrated my email from 10.13 tot 10.14 to find out i had this problem as well.\nThe only solution that worked for me was nr 4\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.appsandbox \\\n    UnrestrictSpotlightContainerScope -bool true\n\nproblem is since some only need this one item and others need more steps, perhaps there are multiple problems to be solved with the same end symptom. \nLetting security relax Container Scope is quite vague and not documented, but it worked for me. \n", "Q: How to download files which are not dmg files to Mac applications? Downloading files on Mac via .dmg is super easy, but anything else e.g. tar.gz files or zip files is completely baffling to me. Where do I unzip the files to make sure the applications will work and be added to my $PATH and $CLASSPATH? What is the correct process and best practice to follow for all of these formats?\nA great example is me downloading this:\nhttp://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/\nWhere I don't know what to do next. Obviously I don't want to unzip into my Downloads folder? Do I unzip into my applications folder?\n\nA: There is no general answer to this, it depends entirely on what is in the download.\nIn the particular case of the Stanford NLP download that you mention the zip contains resources for a Java developer to use when building a natural language processing program. It does not appear to contain anything that you can run without doing some Java coding.\n\nA: First and foremost, Bing and Google are your friends.  Make it a point to spend time with each in your quest for knowledge.\nSuffice to say, there is TONS of info related to what you asked, here's some info to get your started:\nWhat's a .dmg?\nA .dmg file is an Apple Disk Image.  Basically, it is a file that looks and acts like a hard disk or a CD/DVD.  The same way you can take a DVD of Adobe Photoshop and insert it into your Mac and it opens, a .dmg will do the same thing.  Another way to look at it is being a \"virtual\" disk.\nWhat's a \"zip\" file?\nA zip file is a file that has been compressed (made smaller) to save space and make it easier for transport (like email).  It can be one file, or many files in a zip archive, but the key here is that it is compressed.\nWhat's a \"tar\" file?\nA tar file or more commonly known as a Tarball is a collection of files into a single archive.  An easier way to think about this is if you had a collection of music all sorted by album.  If you get a big safe crate to store every one of your albums in, then the crate would be your Tarball.\nConveniently, you can combine the compression and tarring of files so that you end up with a compressed archive.  These will be archives that look like .tgz  In this case it was \"tarred\" and \"zipped.\"\nAs for \"what do you do next\" that comes down to what do you want to accomplish?\nFor now, so you can get a better understanding of Unix and how it relates to OS X, there are books like Learning Unix for OS X and YouTube Videos\nI hope this is answer was able to get you started off in the right direction.\n", "Q: Using Package Installers behind company firewall Is there a more efficient way to use package installers behind a firewall than adjusting the proxy settings for each installer? \nAs of now, I'm using Ruby Gems, Bower, and NPM and it's a pain to reset everything individually when my password changes or there's an update to our settings. \nI'm looking for a more centralized solution. \n\nA: The common answer is to setup a local proxy like squidman or cntlm, so your login/pass credentials are only stored in one place - and all of your CLI tools point at a local proxy:port.\nYou can also go to your network people (who think all your broken developer tools are a personal problem, not theirs) and point out that you're forced to hardcode your login and password (GASP!) not only all over your machine, your virtual machines, and even AWS instances...\nAnd then it VERY MUCH becomes their problem.

I can export as a \"pdf bundle\", but preview 8.0 doesn't want to open such a file. I expect there are many other pdf readers, both in osX land and other OS's, that won't understand the bundle.\nHave I missed something?\n\nA: Skim doesn't save notes and highlights within the PDF file itself. That's why they don't show up in other viewers (much like 'bookmarks' in Preview).\nIt's possible to export a copy with notes and highlights embedded: File > Export… then choose file format \"PDF\" and mark the option \"With embedded notes\". They will show up in Preview and Acrobat. However, Skim can't edit the notes of the exported copy anymore.

I have an old iPhone application which was created using Xcode 4.3.2. I want to get it running on Xcode. However, I am using OS X 10.9.5. So I get the error \"This installation of Xcode 4.3.2 requires Mac OS X Lion\". So I searched online and found an article about running Xcode 4.3.2 on VirtualBox. Now when I try to install Xcode 4.3.2 on Lion on VirtualBox, I get the error message \"You have Mac OS X 10.7. The application requires Mac OS X 10.7.3 or later. How can I upgrade to 10.7.3 to get Xcode working?\n\nA: If you start from a base install - 10.n.0 then you can always directly update to a given 'point release' by using the Combo Updater for that release.\nThese appear to always remain available from Apple.\nThe Combo updater for 10.7.3 is at https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1484\n\nA: Simply use a so-called Combo Updater:\nDownload at least OS X Lion Update 10.7.3 (Client Combo).

Rebooting a normal boot causes a shutdown before the graphical UI fires up.  Safe boot does the same thing. During a verbose boot, I saw that the boot drive wasn't able to be mounted and the system gives up, going into a clean shutdown.\nSo, I booted into Recovery and ran Disk Utility. The Fusion drive was grayed out but running First Aid on it found no problems with the CoreStorage or actual HFS volume. It refused to mount by hand in a Terminal window (even with the readOnly option).\nNext I booted into single-user mode where I was able to capture these unusual messages:\n\nThe key here seems to be the 3rd line Too few free segments, mark MLV as readonly. I assume this is from the CoreStorage structure but Googling find very few references to phrases like this. It crossed my mind that it could be referring to the SSD as well, but I'm honestly not too familiar with their storage details. After that, you can see the journal replay fails due to \"privilege violation\" (presumably the read-only status). On normal or safe boots, this pushes the system into a clean shutdown since it can't mount the root volume read-write with the permissions issue and a dirty journal (see more below).\nInterestingly, in single-user boot the drive is mounted read-only at / just fine. I've skimmed through the directories and nothing looks odd. Running fsck_cs and fsck_hfs by hand report no errors at all. But the drive fails to mount read-write at any point. From single-user, I was also able to look at the system.log, but no real clues there either. The last bits in the log look like typical sleep cycle messages.\nIn any case, the HFS volume is only ~60-70% full, as confirmed in single-user mode. Curiously, DU shows the volume as full when booted into Recovery, but I'm not sure I trust that since it clearly isn't booting the volume there (e.g., there's no breakdown on the drive space into file types... it's all \"Other\").\nBooting from an external drive didn't give results much different from Recovery—the drive can't be mounted, even read-only. Here's the output from fsck_cs:\n   Executing fsck_cs (version 517.20.1)\n** Checking volume\n** disk0s2: Scan for Volume Headers\n** disk1s2: Scan for Volume Headers\n** disk1s5: Scan for Volume Headers\n** disk0s2: Scan for Disk Labels\n** disk1s2: Scan for Disk Labels\n** disk1s5: Scan for Disk Labels\n** Logical Volume Group 56BA393B-9EF3-4BE6-8CA0-240920F97724 spans 3 devices\n** disk0s2+disk1s2+disk1s5: Scan for Metadata Volume\n** Logical Volume Group has a 210 MB Metadata Volume with double redundancy\n** Start scanning metadata for a valid checkpoint\n** Load and verify Segment Headers\n** Load and verify Checkpoint Payload\n** Load and verify Transaction Segment\n** Incorporate 0 newer non-checkpoint transactions\n** Load and verify Virtual Address Table\n** Load and verify Segment Usage Table\n** Load and verify Metadata Superblock\n** Load and verify Logical Volumes B-Trees\n** Logical Volume Group contains 1 Logical Volume\n** Load and verify DF9F3BA2-1863-4EEF-AA29-EEA46DE5151E\n** Load and verify 13503CA3-FAC4-4CB1-ACF4-6930800B12E8\n** Load and verify Freespace Summary\n** Load and verify Block Accounting\n** Load and verify Live Virtual Addresses\n** Newest transaction commit checkpoint is valid\n** Load and verify Segment Cleaning\n** The volume 56BA393B-9EF3-4BE6-8CA0-240920F97724 appears to be OK\n\nAnd here's what the Console reports as the system tries to mount the drive when fsck_cs finishes—these are nearly identical to the boot error messages:\ncom.apple.kextd[24]: LVG changed\nkernel[0]: CoreStorage: fsck_cs has finished for group \"56BA393B-9EF3-4BE6-8CA0-240920F97724\" with status 0x00\ncom.apple.kextd[24]: LVG changed\nkernel[0]: thr <ptr> Upgrading read-only MLV to at least read-only LV because LVG is sparse\nkernel[0]: thr <ptr> Too few free segments, mark MLV as readonly\ncom.apple.kextd[24]: LVG changed\nkernel[0]: hfs: early journal init: volume on disk2 is read-only and journal is dirty.

It's been running well for the last year or so. Nothing special was tweaked the day before this happened, either. If it matters, a BootCamp partition on the HDD still boots just fine. And I see no i/o errors in logs that are often preludes to disk failure.\nAt this point I am out of ideas other than destroying and re-creating the CS/Fusion volume with a TM backup, but I'm looking for other threads to follow before I waste a day doing that process.\n\nA: I had this same problem, (out of free segments in mlv) and I used DiskWarrior 5 to repair my drive's permissions and rebuild the directory, and it fixed it for me.\n", "Q: How to show Hard Disk icon on Desktop via Terminal?

On the side of the iPhone packaging, Apple defines 1GB as 1,000,000,000 bytes (rather than 1,073,741,824 bytes), so you end up missing 9,438,953,472 bytes (~9GB) calculating it this way for 128GB of space (128,000,000,000 bytes is ~119GB).\nMy iPhone says that it has 113GB of capacity, but it should be 119GB, so where did the other 6GB disappear to?\n\nA: I believe iOS displays capacities in base-10 values as well, so iOS would show the raw space as 128GB. The 15GB difference (128-113) is due to both iOS and formatting, not a discrepancy between base-2 and base-10.\n\nA: The other 6 GB are OS itself. The given capacity is a value for the physical storage that the phone has, not the amount that can be used by the owner. iOS is about 6 GB in size on its own.\nAlso, the formatted capacity is less than the size of the chips that are manufactured into the device. It's in a very small footnote at the bottom of the tech specs for each iOS device. Typically note #1\n\nAs you can see on the following link, each OS differs between versions, device type and device size so the gap in specs to usable space isn't a fixed constant.\n\n\n*\n\n*How large is iOS?\n\nA: To simply put, it is used by the Operating System. All that code would have to go somewhere, right? Also, if you notice, with every new major update they try to cut down that space. Even if you write a simple program, it would take up some memory from your computer. It is the same concept for cell phones as well. \n\nA: The OS needs that space, operating systems take up lots of space\n", "Q: How do I stop this person (IP address) from trying to connect to my Mac via screensharing?

Is there any way I can block this guy without actually turning off screen sharing?\nEdit: I should probably note that I'm aware my system is not ideal from a security perspective. I just want a way to block this one IP.\n\nA: The bigger question here is why is your Mac not behind a firewall that is doing some sort of port filtering/forwarding as well as stateful packet inspection?\nIf you were behind a firewall you could block/filter out IP addresses, but this is only temporary because all the attacker has to do is change their IP.\nInstead of VNC, which in my opinion is very weak in terms of both security and functionality and instead go for a product like TeamViewer (free for personal use) and you don't have to open any ports on your firewall to use it.\nBy the way, your attacker is coming from China....\n \n", "Q: Strange MBP Wi-Fi problems I have an early-2015 MBP running 10.11.2 and have been having wifi problems on certain networks ever since buying it.\nAt home, my internet connection will drop every 10-15 minutes - according to the Network menu, I'm still connected to my router, but I get a timeout anytime I try to visit a page.

Not sure if this is related to the other issue but it's still irritating. \n\nA: WiFi problems have been a constant problem with OS X over the past few releases.  El Capitan is supposed to have fixed them, but problems still persist. \nFortuntaley, there is a fix and it invloves trashing your wireless setttings and starting again from scratch.  OS X Daily has a good write up on how to accomplish this.\n", "Q: Does Textmate have anything like Emacs's point and mark for making selections? In Emacs, I can easily select a phrase in the middle of a sentence using incremental search. For example, I've written the sentence \"I have never been to Paris, but I have taken a virtual tour of the Eiffel Tower, and I'm very excited to see it in person\". Then I decide that I'd rather move \"I have taken a virtual tour of the Eiffel Tower\" to the beginning of the sentence.\nTo do this in Emacs, I would use incremental search to find \"I\", move to the start of the word, set the mark, then search again for \"Tower\" and move to its end. Now everything in between is a selected region and can be operated on.\nCan I achieve the same result in Textmate? \nI am familiar with its incremental search, but I cannot find a connection to selecting text. There is the \"Extend selection to include next\" command in the Text Bundle (bound to ^W), but that doesn't work for two different search targets and makes multiple selections rather than selecting everything in between.\nExtending the selection using ⇧⌥ and arrow keys is the closest I've come up with, but it means tapping an arrow key for every word. Selecting to the end or beginning of a line is not what I want; I'm looking to capture something in the middle of the line.\nI'm not tied to using incremental search: it's just how I do this in Emacs. (Is there some way to use ⌥^B in non-source-code text?) I'm open to any solution that allows me to quickly move from one arbitrary place in the text to another, selecting everything in between, without switching to the mouse.\n\nA: Cocoa/OS X's built-in Key Bindings system make this possible. The text view in TextMate implements the highly-relevant NSResponder action methods setMark: and selectToMark:.\nThe TextMate manual explains that ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate is the right place for a custom KeyBindings.dict file to set the bindings for those actions. Adding these lines to the dictionary:\n\"^ \"       = \"setMark:\";\n\"^~ \"      = \"selectToMark:\";\n\nbinds ⌃-Space to set the mark (the same binding for this action as Emacs) wherever the cursor is currently located, and ⌃-⌥-Space to select from the cursor to the previously-set mark. This is one extra keypress compared to Emacs, but it'll get the job done.\n", "Q: How to resize windows on OS X Is there a way I can resize the current app window with a combinations of keys?

It is not an official app of the App Store, but it is open source and it does perfectly what you are looking for.\nJust download the app, open it and it's done. There are a lot of pre-defined shortcuts for dealing with the window size the way you like, like in this pic:\n\nAs you see, if you click on the \"glasses\" icon, you can see all the shortcuts to minimise, maximise or just change the size of the window.\nOf course, these keys are fully customisable.

Also, look at things like iCloud photo library, podcast apps, My Photo Stream and others that wait until you connect to WiFi to avoid burning cellular data.\nCan you take it to a proper WiFi temporarily to see if after 30 minutes whatever backup and sync are needed complete and then you will have lower usage going forward?\n\nA: I used  Mifi to connect my iPad and had similar difficulties.

Years ago I changed my cdrom in my Macbook for a second hard drive, and have been using a SSD as a first drive ever since.\nThis HD is shown in Finder, and, clicking on it with two fingers, there's an option to encrypt it.\nSince this has never been an endorsed upgrade from Apple (changing the cdrom for a HD) I've never used this encrypt option, but now I'm traveling too much because of work and I'm planning to do it if somehow I lose the macbook or it gets stolen.\nDoes anyone here now of any caveats of this approach? I think this is the same option if you plug an external HD in USB.\n\nA: I think I'm correct to say it's safe! As Mac OS sees it as a drive you can just use the encryption.\nOther people have tested it in Apple Support Comunnities and it seems to work so far.\n", "Q: Execute a file via keyboard in Finder I have a Finder window open to a directory that contains files.

That will open an editor with the formula contents. If there is a reference to a \"bottle\", then installing it with default settings will use that. \nHowever, if you add an option, then homebrew will compile the software for you. \n", "Q: MDM iPad - Mass update without downloading update X times This is a difficult one. I'm going to update around 30 iPads (iOS 8 to 9.2.1) on location with a bad internet connection. Because of the speed and wifi signal I want to download the iOS update only once and install it on all iPads. The problem is, when I connect the devices to my macbook it wants to configure as new or want to use my own last backup. \nDoes anyone know how to update all iPads without downloading the same iOS update X times?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: An OS X/macOS server with the caching service enabled will prevent all the iPads from fetching the same update from Apple's. \n\nA: It looks like you can't download the update once and install it via Apple Configurator / iTunes. Best way is to setup MDM tool + DEP (Device enrollment Program) in supervised modus and install update over the air.\n", "Q: Backing up iPhone I haven't been able to back up my iPhone due to connection issues.

I formated an usb-Stick (64GB) on my iMac (Mac Journaled Filesystem). Not encrypted, no password.

Other Sticks works fine but this stupid single stick not.\nThis is the last chance for this stick. I'll give it to a poor life by a windows guy if there is no chance to fix it :-(.\n\nA: I know the reason ! It works with an USB-Hub with additional power. Plugged into the Macs directly, no stick is working.\nOn Windows-based machines (even in the Bootcamp on my iMac) the stick is working.

See the NSHipster article about how to get and set up this useful developer tool:\n\nUsing this approach will allow you to run Mail continuously without risking your IMAP access being limited.\nManually Enable and Disable the Account\nYou could add the mail account, then manually enable and disable the account as desired.\nMail.app > Mail (menu) > Preferences > Accounts > Enable Account (checkbox)\nYou can measure the network traffic using Activity Monitor.app's Network view; see Sent Bytes and Rcvd Bytes.\nApplications > Utilities > Activity Monitor.app\nThis would allow you to watch the initial synchronisation traffic climb to a reasonable level before disabling the account.\n\n\nA: A semi automation solution i just thought of would be to create an automator script to open mail.app at 20:00 and close it at 222:00 every night, that way it would only download for 2 hours, thus not triggering the block on the gmail account (values would have to be tweaked but my gut is 2 hours worth of emails wouldnt cause the account to block - subject to your internet speed)\nOnly caveat i can see is that you'd have to leave the machine open (if its a laptop) for the automator script to run  \n", "Q: Half of my iMovie videos disappeared, can I retrieve them?

It's important to describe which hardware/software you used as it will determine the location of the files.  iMovie, I believe, you could have only used for editing.\nAs an aside, I can recommend using the Procreate iPad app for recording artwork, the feature is built in, you don't have to do anything to record as it happens automatically, and the resulting screencasts are very high quality and with good timing.\n", "Q: osascript dialog box is blocking.

The probability to recover a FAT volume on a disk with a MBR seems to be much lower though. Apparently parts (namely some metadata and volume headers) may be overwritten by FAT32 file system stuff.\nThe same disk containing an encrypted external HFS+ volume should look like this:\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  133545904      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  133955544     262144      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  134217688          7         \n  134217695         32         Sec GPT table\n  134217727          1         Sec GPT header\n\nThe first partition is the EFI partition with a fixed size and start block, the third one is an Apple_Boot partition with a fixed size and start block relative to the last block of the disk and the remaining disk space allocated to the encrypted Core Storage Logical Group. All partitions are aligned to the physical block size of the disk (4096 Bytes).\n\n*To restore the old partition table you have to unmount the disk, delete the actual partition table and do some math to create a new one:\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk1\nsudo gpt destroy /dev/disk1\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk1\nsudo gpt create -f /dev/disk1\ngpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk1\n\n\n*Now get the last block number of your disk (in my example that's 134217727) and substract 262183: LastBlockNumber-262183 is the start block of the 3rd partition (Apple_Boot). Add this partition with:\ngpt add -b LastBlockNumber-262183 -i 3 -s 262144 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1\n\n\n*Check the size of the unallocated disk space between partition 1 and partition 3 with:\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1\n\n\n*The size of unallocated disk space (UnAlloc) between index 1 and index 3 is probably the size of the old encrypted volume. The size has to be divisible by 8 - please check this! Add this as a partition with:\ngpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s UnAlloc -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1 #with UnAlloc= size of unallocated disk space found above\n\n\n*After entering the last command you should be asked for password of the encrypted disk. if not then try:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nto get a list of CoreStorage items. Try to mount the encrypted volume with:\ndiskutil cs unlockVolume LVUUID\n\nwith LVUUID: the UUID of the encrypted Logical Volume (usually the last one listed). If your main volume is also encrypted choose the proper LVUUID!\nIf the volume mounts successfully save the most important files and folders to an external volume because mounting the encrypted volume doesn' t necessarily mean that the volume isn't corrupted.\nUnmount the volume and run diskutil verifyDisk /dev/disk1 and diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk1. The last command may completely corrupt the disk!\n\nThis might still fail. The encrypted volume may still be recoverable though. But then I need more information, because special (invisible) non-file system items have to been read directly from disk with a HexEditor and then restored/replaced.\n\nA: I followed Klanomath's reply above to successfully recover my Macintosh HD. I had tried to resize it from ubuntu (Bootcamp) and completely stopped seeing my Macintosh HD partition. I had tried several posts and tools to write and rewrite partition tables without success and was about to give up.\nI followed the steps #5 to #8 from the post.\nI did # 5 and assumed that my EFI would've started at 40 and had the same size 409600. The following screenshot from stellar recovery showed advanced volume starting at 40 so it gave me some hope that my EFI at least started at the same sector.\n\nResult from my machine:\n diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk4\nUnmount of all volumes on disk4 was successful\n sudo gpt destroy /dev/disk4\n diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk4\nUnmount of all volumes on disk4 was successful\n sudo gpt create -f /dev/disk4\n gpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk4\ndisk4s1 added\n\nFor #6, here was the output from my machine:\n$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk4\nPassword:\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6\n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  976695387\n  977105027         32         Sec GPT table\n  977105059          1         Sec GPT header\n\nI had the last block of my hard disk (977105059), now what should be my third (last) partition whose size I should subtract from the end? (I remembered that I used to have a Recovery disk, a ubuntu disk in addition to the Macintosh HD. Also, testdisk had showed me dozens of lost recovery partition, which I guessed based on their sizes, but I couldn't pick between them).\nSo I referred to the above screenshot again (stellar recovery). At this point I have seen and know that a mac Recovery HD is about 600ish MB so I have a few candidates from above screenshot. According to this post, the starting sector needs to be able to completely dividable by 8, which only worked for 'Lost Volume 6' from the screenshot.\nSo that gave me the starting sector (975835488) but what about the size? Well, from a few screenshots from a couple days ago of testdisk scan results (which showed me dozens of lost recovery disk partitions) I had noticed that though all of their starting sectors were different, their sizes were the same i.e. 1269536 (see screenshot below). This gave me confidence that this was the right size (in sectors) for a mac Recovery HD.\n\nSo I ran the following command (using Starting sector:975835488, Size in sectors:1269536)\ngpt add -b 975835488 -i 3 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk4\ndisk4s3 added\n\nFor #7, to show the most recent status of 'gpt -r show':\n$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk4\nPassword:\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6\n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  975425848\n  975835488    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  977105024          3\n  977105027         32         Sec GPT table\n  977105059          1         Sec GPT header\n\nAt this point I was like, \"Oh okay, so my partition table looks slightly similar to the guy's in the post, but that's obviously not gonna do anything\".\nIt was about 2 AM at that point and I just want to go through all the steps to discard yet another post because 'I tried that too'. So I'm kinda rushing through it still trying to get the numbers right.\nSo now for #8, from my last screenshot, 975425848 is the size, and 409640 is the starting sector for my partition that's supposed to be in the middle (aka. Macintosh HD). So I go ahead, still without much hope, and execute the following command:\ngpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s UnAlloc -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk4\nusage: gpt add [-b lba] [-i index] [-s lba] [-t uuid] device ...\n\noops, I actually have to write the size in place of 'UnAlloc'. I missed this from the guy's comments:\nwith UnAlloc= size of unallocated disk space found above\nsecond try:\ngpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s 975425848 -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk4\ndisk4s2 added\n\nThis time the command took a couple of seconds to produce an output which got my heart racing. As soon as it produced the result (disk4s2 added) it asked me for a password for my \"Macintosh HD\" and I am jumping in my seat as I input the password that I can remember and voila, the disk shows up and so does all my data!!\nAfter 4 full days of effort and freakout that I had lost all my work and my photo library, I couldn't believe it worked. Thank you, klanomath. Thank you, God.\np.s. I did all this on another mac with the original mac connected to it via thunderbolt in target disk mode. The Stellar Recovery software was executed on the mac too while test disk results were from a ubuntu live cd on the original mac (though I'm sure I could've ran testdisk on the second mac too albeit slower)\n\nA: To break hard drive encryption either the disk should be formatted or the encryption algorithm be broken using Terminal.

Moving from Linux (OpenBox WM) to MBP, I'm struggling to recover the level of productivity I was used to... One specific thing that's killing it is OSX's insistence on separating between \"applications\" and \"windows\", assigning different key combos to toggling among either, each with its own rotation behavior (sigh). This gets even worse because OSX insists on bringing all the windows of application X to the front whenever I switch to it. I often run into situations where I have two or more Chrome windows and two or more Terminal windows, each group spanning the entire desktop space, but I cannot have one of each at the front at the same time.\nOther constraints: I do not want to move windows to separate workspaces (or whatever that's called) just so I can work with them. I prefer not to use the mouse, but willing to do so if that'll solve my problem (it won't in the above case).\nOne thing that might solve my problem is being able to start new windows of the applications I care about (Chrome, Terminal) as separate instances.

Chrome must be launched from the command line with the --user-data-dir=/tmp/dir flag set in \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\" (specify your own directory… if you only need two instances, probably best to make a permanent second home, but if you need an arbitrary number, best to create a shell function that creates a random temp directory then deletes it on quit). \nUsing this method results in multiple Chrome instances on my machine and prevents Chrome from consolidating them under the same master process. \nBy the way, you may want to incorporate additional flags in your shell function for launching Chrome… an extensive (automatically updated) list is available here.\n\nA: You'll (eventually) have to end up executing the application from Terminal.\nYou can either use the open -n command from Terminal (as mentioned by @Tetsujin) or you can within the application package click on the executable (usually in Application/Contents/MacOS/)\n", "Q: fsck -fy hangs on Checking catalog file + issues booting (MacBook) Last night my MacBook Pro crashed.

I was recently was trying to use a library that needed a 32-bit version of java. I tried to get my version of java to use the 32-bit version by using the flag -d32. However, I received the error:\n\nError: This Java instance does not support a 32-bit JVM. Please install the desired version.\n\nI have been trying to find how to download the 32-bit version of java for OS X, but with little success. Any help would be welcome. Is it possible even without an official download to use OpenJDE in 32 bit form?\n\nA: To my (limited) knowledge, OS X no longer receives 32-bit only versions of Java from Oracle, as the last version of OS X to support 32 bit machines was 10.6. With that said, the last Apple distribution of Java appears to support 32-bit mode–if you enable it. With that said, apparently it's still not always so happy about running. However, according to this post, by editing some binaries, you can force it to.\nThe key is to replace /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java with a 32-bit mode only binary.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use \"xxd -g1 java | grep -E 'c. fa'\" to find out the binary header.\n\n\n\nxxd -g1 java | grep -E 'c. fa'\n0001000: ce fa ed fe 07 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 02 00 00 00\n000c4b0: 01 28 6f d8 ce 3b 3a b0 c9 cd fa 87 b1 35 df 08\n000d000: cf fa ed fe 07 00 00 01 03 00 00 80 02 00 00 00\n000f060: 00 0f 84 c7 fa ff ff 48 8d 3d 96 39 00 00 be 01\n\n07 00 00 00 is the 32-bit one. 1\nSo the 32-bit binary starts from 0x1000 and ends at 0xd000 with a length of 0xc000.\n\n\n*Extract the 32-bit mode binary using your favorite tools....(eg. dd) for me I like xxd as its syntax is easier to remember. Verify it by using \"file java\".\n\n*Backup the original java binary.\n\n*Replace the \"/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java\" binary with the extracted 32-bit mode only binary in step 2.\n\n*Test! If Java console is not shown, and there is no Java preference to turn it on, you can use the deployment.properties file at ~/Library/Caches/Java and add \"deployment.console.startup.mode=SHOW\".\nWith that said, I don't the internals of Java well, and it's entirely possible that this changes based on which JVM you're using.\n", "Q: Type Lambda λ on a Mac? Is there a way to type lambda λ on a mac without switching the entire keyboard binding to Greek, as described here: How do you type Theta on a Mac?\n\nA: Copy the λ character from the original post. Paste it wherever you want it ;)\n\nA: *\n\n*Press Command ⌘+Control ⌃+Space.\n\n*Type lamda into the search bar. Pay attention to type lamda instead of lambda.\n\n*Your lamda should be there:\n\n\nYou might ask why it is spelt lamda not lambda. \nAccording to the link provided by MJeffryes:\n\nThe use of the spelling lamda derives from ISO 10646. This does not\n  mean that it is more correct than lambda, merely that the spelling\n  without the 'b' is the one used in the formal character names.\n\nHere are two more links provided by Itai Ferber:\n\n\n*\n\n*Proof that lamda is in the standard\n\n*Proof that lamda is in the standard since at least 1993\n\nHere is a website about Mac keyboard shortcuts: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236.\n\nA: I use the Emojis and Symbols menu to plug in characters I can't type via the keyboard. Awkward, but it works. (PS - If you happen to be working in Microsoft Word, it's dead easy - in preferences, enable \"Math Autocorrect\" outside of math fields, then type \\lambda to insert it.)\n\nA: If you have access to Vim/gVim (the editor, which seems to go by the MacVim name on Mac), go into INSERT mode, press Ctrl + k followed by * followed by l. A λ character will be produced.\nCopy that into the clipboard and you're good to go.\nYou can do this for other Greek letters too, just replace l with a, b, c, d etc. You can also get upper case versions of those letters by just entering them as... upper case!\nThat applies to other Vim distributions as well.\n\nA: If you are an owner of Alfred Powerpack (only £17), you can download this workflow to search and type in any symbols quickly. That's what I use whenever I need to quickly type in any unicode symbol on my mac.\nWorks like this :\n\n\nA: What is your reason for not wanting to switch the entire keyboard binding to Greek?  If your reason was just that switching by the menu is a bit cumbersome, then you could set up a keyboard shortcut instead, for very quick layout switching.\nWith this, it takes just three keystrokes to type a λ (or any other Greek letter).  I frequently need to type isolated Greek letters within a mostly latin-alphabet setting (I’m a mathematician), and I find this setup very convenient\nIn detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a Greek keyboard layout to your input sources, under System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*add a keyboard shortcut for switching to the most recently-used layout different from the current one, under System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Input Sources.  I use Command ⌘+Option ⌥+Space, which doesn’t (iirc) conflict with any system default shortcuts:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you can get a λ by typing ⌘+⌥+Space (switch the input layout to Greek); l (actually produce the λ); ⌘+⌥+Space (switch back to whatever layout you were typing in before).  And, as a bonus, the rest of the Greek alphabet is at your fingertips as well!\n\n\nA: Three one keystroke solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ukelele and make option-L produce lambda.\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Text and check Correct spelling automatically. Then add a rule to replace the standard \noutput of option-L (which is ¬) with λ.\n\n*Use Karabiner to do the same.  (A bit more difficult.)\n\nA: If you will be writing it often, I would recommend going to System Preferences → Keyboard → Text and adding a new replace rule: Replace lambda with λ.\n\nA: Add the Chrome extension \"TeX for Gmail\" (available from the Chrome Web Store). Compose an email in Gmail, type \\lambda , select (highlight) that, click on the Tex button just to the right of the Send button at the bottom and choose \"Guess Naive Tex\". You can then copy and paste the λ character wherever you want. Having a Mac clipboard extension that has a history of what you have copied makes it more useful.\nOf course it works for other Greek letters, e.g. \\theta\nObscure but nice for those who already use Latex and or wanted to type it in Gmail on Chrome. Maybe it will be a gateway to Latex for others :)\nOnce you have this extension you can type nicely typeset math in documents providing you know or learn Latex.\nAnother obscure way, for emacs or Aquamacs users, type \"C-x 8 RET 3bb\". For those of you know Unicode really well :)\nIn any case different strokes for different folks.\n", "Q: Is there anything (like iOS) that emulate force touch for older MacBook?

The solution there is a stopgap solution because the asking person neither had a thumb drive nor an external disk or a second Mac. You have to have a system drive with a full OS X to install additional apps like wxHexEditor to inspect the raw data on the drive. So the only practicable way there was an OS X install on the corrupted drive with the risk to overwrite the old \"lost\" partitions.\n\nIf you have a second boot device like an external disk or a thumb drive install a newer full OS X (not just a bootable installer thumb drive!). Additionally install wxHexEditor. Enable the root user, log in as root.\nNow open wxHexEditor and determine the boundaries of the \"lost\" Recovery HD. Overwriting the original GUID partition table and replacing it by an MBR with Windows' Disk Management usually doesn't touch the content of your disk. The old data structures are still on the disk and can be found by searching for special strings and files' content.\nThe asking person gave the following information: the Windows partition had a size of 100 GB. This facilitates the search because the first ~390 GB (of the 500 GB disk) can be skipped since the Windows partition is created at the end of a disk.\nThe Recovery HD partition has the following content:\n  0-1. block:        0x00s\n    2. block:        the string \"HFSJ\" in the first 16 Bytes\n    8. block:        0xFFs (probably an allocation file)\n11-13. block:        0xFFs (probably a second allocation file)\n\nIf you have found these blocks you can easily determine the start block of the Recovery HD as described in the linked answer. Since all other partitions (EFI and the main OS X volume - assuming that only one main volume exists) are determined by the first block of the Recovery HD the math can be done.\n\nThe final solution was:\ngpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s 779781456 -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\ngpt add -b 780191096 -i 3 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\n\nAfter verifying the volumes with:\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk0s2\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk0s3\n\nand removing temporary partitions the main volume was finally expanded to span the whole disk with:\ndiskutil cs resizeStack lvUUID 0g\n\n\nA: My partition is recovered thanks to @klanomath. It was quit difficult to get the right boundaries following the standard procedure and without knowing the characteristics of a disk with old windows and osx partitions. @klanomath did a great job looking for the Recovery-HD and from there determining the lost partition. Learned a lot. Thanks again!

Is there a quick one-liner to combine multiple pdfs into one?\nI know it can be done using Preview.app\n\nA: Apple's python script in the Automator action is very slow, as it uses CoreGraphics's CGPDFDocument APIs, rather than the newer PDFKit framework. It also imports the entire CoreGraphics library, rather than just the required APIs.\nAn alternative, faster python script, can be found here: \nThis script also adds a Table of Contents to the PDF, listing each component file (and merging existing ToCs), which Apple's does not.\nIt can be used on the command line (with PDF filenames as arguments), or in an Automator shell script action, to make a Quick Action/Service for the Finder.\n\nA: FWIW, I've written a quick little program that lets you do this without having to rely on external dependencies like the system python and such.

It only modifies the \nprimary and secondary GPT header and table and the MBR. Or with other words: it only modifies the first 34 blocks and the last 33 blocks of a device. This means: if you add a partition starting at block 40 and ending at block 409640 (these are the boundaries of a typical OS X EFI partition) it doesn't write anything to the blocks 40-409640 but only to the GPT headers/tables. \nAdding a partition doesn't result in a file system and far less in a readable file system. To create a file system you have to format the partition with an appropriate tool like newfs_hfs! After formatting a partition the file system is essentially empty except the necessary parts which \"represent\" the file system like catalog file, allocation file etc.\nIf you remove a partition with a file system or remove the whole partition table containing several formatted partitions with gpt remove|destroy ... the file system(s) won't be touched. So after restoring a partition or a partition table with the same values they had previously the file system(s) with all content will \"reappear\".\nOne (rare) case exists where a partition might be enlarged: if some unallocated disk space is directly \"behind\" a partition. If you first remove a partition with gpt and then re-add the partition with the same start block but a larger size the previous file system is completely in the boundaries of the new partition. But at least the allocation file (~volume bitmap) is corrupted and the alternative volume header is at the wrong location. Usually such an \"intentionally corrupted\" file system can be repaired with diskutil repairVolume .... You are highly discouraged though to use this method to enlarge a partition.\n\nModifying disk partitions with gpt like in your question or as described below will delete any current partition (and its content) with a high probability. To resize (expand or shrink) a current partition while keeping the content use diskutil!\nStarting using an empty disk with a default GPT partition table you get the following partition scheme:\nsh-3.2# gpt show /dev/disk1\n        start         size  index  contents\n            0            1         PMBR\n            1            1         Pri GPT header\n            2           32         Pri GPT table\n           34  17179869117         \n  17179869151           32         Sec GPT table\n  17179869183            1         Sec GPT header\n\nThough newer disks report a logical block size of 512 Bytes they usually have a physical block size of 4096 Bytes.\n\n\n*\n\n*1st rule: start blocks and partition sizes should be dividable by 8 to align partitions to physical blocks\n\n*2nd rule: you can't assign more blocks than available (the max. available number of blocks is: 17179869117 (and aligning to physical blocks: 2147483639 x 8 = 17179869112 blocks)\n\n*3rd rule: try to specify a GUID type\nOne viable option is:\ngpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 17179869112 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk1\n\nOr you might add an EFI partition and leave some space at the end of the disk (as Apple does):\ngpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B /dev/disk1\ngpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s 17179197368 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk1\n\nAfter adding the partitions you have to format the main partition:\nnewfs_hfs -J -v \"Name\" /dev/disk1s1\n\nor if you chose the second partition table (with EFI partition)\nnewfs_hfs -J -v \"Name\" /dev/disk1s2\n\n", "Q: Can I delete Xcode?

You cannot fully disable it other than disabling Spotlight completely. \n\nIf you add a Time Machine backup disk to the privacy list, you will continue to see messages that Spotlight is indexing your backup disk. This indexing is necessary for Time Machine to function properly and can’t be disabled. Spotlight does exclude from searches any items you store on your backup disk that are not part of a Time Machine backup.\n\nAs for disabling Spotlight/ejecting your drive safely, there are various solutions here, where the necessary command appears to be \nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\n", "Q: iOS Causing Network-Wide Disruption So, interesting problem, whenever I plug my iPhone 6 Plus into charge, I get massive disruption across my whole network, wired and wireless.

I haven't noticed anything different yet. Is it reversible?\nBy the way, I haven't yet set up time machine, and I now regret it.\n\nA: XQuartz is a windowing system on its own, just installing it doesn't change anything. If you need to run application requiring X11/XQuartz, you need to start the Xquartz app (aka X11 server) before you start the application. The X11 server will then run \"on top\" of OS X, so the behaviour of other applications doesn't change.\nSee also What is XQuartz? for more details. \n", "Q: Limechat Sticky Sessions Is there a way to have Limechat \"stickily\" joined into a network+room(s)?\nMy laptop sleeps, and it takes the connection with it.

Great way to stay on IRC.\n", "Q: iPhone 6s calendar alert issue Why does my calendar no longer hold two different time alert? What I put in my second alert will change my first alert to match what I put for my second alert.\n\nA: It appears that the second alert must occur before the first alert does, otherwise iOS will set the second alert to match the first alert. So, make sure your first alert (\"Alert\") is set to the time closest to the event, and the second alert is set to whatever time you want that is before the first alert.\n\nA: On my iPhone 6s, before I upgraded to iOS 9, the Calendar alerts worked in the reverse of the way they seem to now; \"Alert\" had to be earlier than \"Second Alert\" when both are set to something other than \"None\".  I reported this to Apple but now on iOS 9.3 there is still no change. So I created a bogus appointment for a test; if I set \"Alert\" to say 5 minutes before, and \"Second Alert\" to 15 minutes, what would occur? Firstly, it accepted these entries instead of trying to reset one alert to the same value as the other. Secondly, I got the first alert 15 minutes before the appointment time, and the final alert 5 minutes before. My conclusion: For whatever reason, Apple has changed (reversed) the way the alerts function.  I find it more counterintuitive and confusing; I don't like it but at least I can work with it.\n\nA: \"Alert #1\" must be father away from the calendar date than \"Alert #2\"\nExample: If the event is on 3/20/2016, then \"Alert #1\" can be a week before while \"Alert #2\" is only 1 day before. Notice how \"Alert #1\" is farther away from our even than \"Alert #2\".\n\nA: Mine had the same problem - second alert would not even show up. I had to go into iCloud and enter an email address other than outlook or hotmail.  Once I added in my gmail account the second alert option became available.  Apparently having the calendar linked to only an outlook/hotmail account does not allow for the second alert on the Calendar appointments.\n", "Q: How to execute veracrypt on the command line?

The MBR is stored on the first 512 bytes of this drive. This space is shared by boot code and the MBR partition table. \n\nThis step can not be preformed under OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) with System Integrity Protection (SIP) turn on. (This is the default setting.) If you are using OS X 10.11, you must disable SIP, complete this step, then restore SIP. See the link: How do I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA “rootless” on OS X 10.11, El Capitan?.\n\nIn a Terminal application window, enter the following commands. The first fdisk command flags the Windows partition as the active partition. The second fdisk command changes the Windows partition id to 7.\nINPUT=$(printf  \"f  4\\nq\\ny\")\nsudo  fdisk  -e  /dev/disk0  <<<\"$INPUT\"  &>/dev/null\nINPUT=$(printf  \"s  4\\n7\\nq\\ny\")\nsudo  fdisk  -e  /dev/disk0  <<<\"$INPUT\"  &>/dev/null\n\nYou may need to restart your computer after completing this step.\nOriginal Answer\nThe command fdisk displays the contents of the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. This table can only contain 4 entries and is stored at address 0 of your disk. The command gpt displays the contents of the GUID partition table (GPT). This table can contain 120 entries and starts at address 1 of your disk. (A backup GPT is also stored at the end of the disk.) Legacy systems use a MBR scheme while more modern computers use a GPT scheme. Normally, OS X uses a GPT scheme. When the GPT is employed, the MBR table still exists, but is now called a Protective Master Boot Record (PMBR) table. This PMBR table contains a single entry with ID of EE. This fools any legacy applications, that only use a MBR scheme, into seeing the disk as occupied by a single partition.\nOlder Mac computers install Windows using the MBR scheme. It is my understanding this is also a requirement for Windows 7 installations. To accommodate both schemes simultaneously, Apple shrinks the EE partition in the MBR table to end at the same location as the first partition in the GPT. Usually, the next three partitions in the GPT match the last three partitions in the MBR table. \nAnyway, as far as I can tell, if you enter the command given below in a Terminal application windows, your partitions should be fixed.\nsudo diskutil eraseVolume \"Free Space\" name /dev/disk0s4\n\nWhile the above command should fix the partitioning, the 4th partition in the MBR partition table will not be marked as \"active\". So if you still can not boot to Windows, let me know and I will include steps to mark this partition as \"active\".\n", "Q: Strange File Appeared In My Home Folder I just discovered a strange file in my home folder. \nIt is titled: -\nThe entire contents are the word: ok\non the first line & a blank second line.\nThere is no extension.\nIt was created this past Monday at 4:55pm & last modified/opened at 4:56.\nHow can I find out what created this? Should I be concerned? How can I find what other files, invisible or otherwise, might have been created around that same time on Monday? \n\nA: It's almost certainly harmless. If you select a file on the desktop (even unintentionally) and press enter and then type ok - that would explain the naming.\nI would open the terminal app (/Applications/Utilities) and type file and then drag the questionable file into the window and press enter.\nThat will look at the file contents and give you a hint about what it might contain. Spotlight information could help find other files around the same time, but I'd start with the file tool and get more information or just delete the file named OK - especially if you have a backup where you could get back what you lost if you find out later it was an image or document you needed.\n", "Q: Time Machine disk is filling up to quickly Every time Time Machine does a backup of my Yosemite working disk (140 GB), it adds about 20 GB to the size of the contents of my backup disk, and it fills up very quickly.

Data Recovery! So, the other day I opened up my MBP 2011 (on El Cap) and found it's battery to be drained. Plugged it in and booted it up and got a flashing folder with a question mark thrown in my face. It stood there for a while, mocking me. I thought the worst. But then it suddenly started to come to life, and it actually booted, by it self. Hooray! Figured I should backup and get a new disk, but ultimately I didn't. And today it just came to a halt and I had to shut it down with the power button. Now it of course does not boot at all.\nEntering single user is not possible as it won't recognize there an operating system there at all. I can however use internet recovery to get to diskutil, but it fails the recovery with an \"invalid node structure\" and \"disk full\" messags.\nSame happens if I go to the terminal and run fsck_hfs -l or fsck_hfs -yprd. Giving me the dreaded message Volume was found corrupt and needs to be repaired. So the disk is probably toast. It's nearly 5 years old and never(!) formated. The lack of formatting was why I figured it was running so slow to begin with (I'm holding out for the Skylake MBP's –Apple this is all your fault!).\n\n\n*\n\n*Now, what's my best course of action in this situation? \n\n*Get DiskWarrior and try that? \n\n*Try accessing the disk via target mode from another computer? \n\n*Use ddrescue (how do I do that?)\n\n\nUltimately I settled on the fourth alternative.\n\nUPDATE\nSo it seems the file system is messed up. Initially I thought the hard drive cable was borked. But it's not the case. I haven't dropped my computer or anything like that. I haven't heard any ticking sounds either. But I have experience tremendous slowdowns. I didn't think much of it, except that I probably had those thanks to not having formatting the drive in 5 years.\nI went to the computer store and got myself:\n\n\n*\n\n*1x 4TB 3.5\" hard drive + chassi (For cloning the crashed drive)\n\n*1x 1TB 2.5\" hard drive + chassi (For hosting the clone)\n\n*Screwdrivers\n\n*A 250GB SSD to use as main drive in the MacBook.\n\n\nSo when I got home from work today I pulled the drive from my MacBook and put it in the 2.5\" chassi. Put the 4TB drive in the 3.5\" chassi and followed this helpful tip.\nI ran ddrescue via\nsudo /usr/local/bin/ddrescue -v -n -c 4096 /dev/disk5s2 Rescue.dmg Rescue.log\n\n..and it started chugging away, cloning the disk to my 4TB disk.\nWhen I came back 2 hours later it had spit out the message \"Finished\" and I noted that it had rescued 90GB. \nGNU ddrescue 1.20\nAbout to copy an unknown number of Bytes from /dev/disk2s2 to Rescue.dmg.\n    Starting positions: infile = 0 B,  outfile = 0 B\n    Copy block size: 4096 sectors       Initial skip size: 128 sectors\nSector size: 512 Bytes\n\nPress Ctrl-C to interrupt\nInitial status (read from mapfile)\nrescued:    90752 MB,  errsize:    5120 B,  errors:      10\n\nCurrent status\nrescued:    90752 MB,   errsize:      5120 B,    current rate:       0 B/s\n   ipos:   749297 MB,    errors:        10,      average rate:       0 B/s\n   opos:   749297 MB,  run time:          1s,  remaining time:         n/a\ntime since last successful read:          1s\nFinished  \n\nGiven the drive is 750GB I was not that happy. I also noted that the drive was no longer appearing in diskutil like it did initially. I rebooted. Still no disk. So I pulled the usb cable and put it back, and there it was again. Phew.\nI ran ddrescue again and got the message \"too many files\" thrown in my face. Which I found odd, and then the computer dismounted the 4TB disk and the crashed drive and OSX froze. I tried again and OSX froze up again.\nAt this point I had gotten the 250GB SSD setup in the MacBook and gotten OSX on there. So I plugged the crashed drive and the 4TB drive in there instead and tried to run ddrescue. But it would only tell me \"Finished\" after a millisecond.\nAfter some Googling I found that I should drop the \"-n\" and maybe try \"-r\" instead. So this is what I'm doing now. I sent it running with \"-r2\" And have been able to rescue a couple of more GB's:\nGNU ddrescue 1.20\nAbout to copy an unknown number of Bytes from /dev/disk2s2 to Rescue.dmg.\n    Starting positions: infile = 0 B,  outfile = 0 B\n    Copy block size: 4096 sectors       Initial skip size: 128 sectors\nSector size: 512 Bytes\n\nPress Ctrl-C to interrupt\nInitial status (read from mapfile)\nrescued:    90752 MB,  errsize:    5120 B,  errors:      10\n\nCurrent status\nrescued:   120869 MB,   errsize:     45568 B,    current rate:   6610 kB/s\n   ipos:   120869 MB,    errors:        23,      average rate:   4240 kB/s\n   opos:   120869 MB,  run time:  1h 58m 22s,  remaining time:         n/a\ntime since last successful read:          0s\nScraping failed blocks...

Yes that is loaves of frozen bread on top of the drive with some plastic in between.\n\nA: It's not the disk, it's the file system (the HFS+ file system organises its entries in a tree structure, its elements are known as nodes). I've had a similar problem a while back: one day my Mac had nuked its own file system in a similar fashion, without any warning signs. No idea why it happened.\nI was able to boot into an old copy of OS X on an external hard drive (on newer Macs the recovery mode should work as well), mount the corrupted disk in read-only mode, and copy my user folder off the corrupted disk. Then I formatted the entire drive (new partition table and everything) and reinstalled OS X.\n", "Q: Can I choose the open Wi-Fi channel? My MBP's Wifi connection is very slow. How can I know if I am connected to the best available channel and can I choose the one channel instead another?\nI do not have access to this \"public\" router.\nThis is what Wifi Diagnostic tool looks like:\n\n\n\nA: you can't select the frequency that you connect to any specific router to unless you have access to the router.\nIt's like (literally) \"can I access my favorite radio station on 88.5 instead of 102.7?\" It is the base station that determines the frequency (channel) it transmits/receives at.\n\nA: Can you not access the router settings via ip address?

I've noticed that when I right-click on an item the Open With menu lists not only apps in my Applications folder, but also apps in the Applications folder on the Time Machine backup. Rebuilding the Launch Service Database will help clear out the list, but then it just grows back. I attempted to exclude the external drive from Spotlight indexing, but the external drive doesn't appear in the list of drives to exclude. Below is a screenshot of my Open With folder.\n\n\nA: You should be able to exclude Spotlight from adding the apps on the Time machine drive to the \"Open With...\" menu by opening System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy. Then drag the icon of the Time Machine drive into the \"Prevent spotlight...\" window. This adds that drive to list of drives that Spotlight should ignore for searching operations.\nNote that you can't prevent Spotlight from indexing that dive as Time Machine depends on Spotlight to keep a catalog of files, but if you do this and then rebuild the Spotlight index it should prevent Spotlight from adding apps on that drive to your \"Open With...\" menu.\n", "Q: How to confirm Finder's rename prompt using the keyboard?

I presently have 10.6.8?\nMacPro3,1 A1186, 32 GB 800mHz, 2.8GHz, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 275, 30″ Apple Cinema Display\n\nA: The Mac Pro 3,1 [Early 2008] Can quite happily run the current OS X - at time of writing El Capitan 10.11.3.  I have one here running just that.\nAs of Sierra, 10.12, the above still remains true, yet further clarified - El Capitan is the final OS to support the 3,1 [& indeed 4,1 unless it has been firmware updated to 5,1]\nI would, however, be wary of such a long jump in one go. Be certain you have an up to date backup & be prepared for the fact that a large number of your existing apps, if they are the same age as the OS, will also need updating.\nI would also make sure you have a tested, bootable, recovery path should anything go wrong during the update. I've never managed to get a 3,1 to boot from USB; I've always needed a ready-prepared second HD. These days, that's just the recovery partition on my Time Machine drive, but 10.6.8 doesn't have a recovery partition.\nFor belt & braces, I'd clone your exiting drive using something like Carbon Copy Cloner then remove it, so it doesn't cause confusion.\nWish you luck.\n\nA: To provide a somewhat definitive cap statement to this question, as of November 2021 the MacPro3,1 (2008) is really beyond obsolete in the modern macOS world.\nNow that being said as someone who squeezed every ounce of usefulness out of one, I can state that you can pull one seemingly as modern as Catalina if you use dosdude's macOS Patcher.\nThe official end-of-line is El Capitan (10.11). This version of macOS will happily install on a 2008 MacPro.\nThe reasonable end-of-line is High Sierra (10.13). \"Reasonable\" in that you don't need to do much other than upgrade the Bluetooth module to make it work and the performance is acceptable. As well, you can get away with most video cards at this point.\nThe UNreasonable end-of-line is Catalina (10.15). This is \"UNreasonable\" because video performance is heavily impacted unless you get a top-of-the-line aftermarket video card (e.g. the 680GTX), but then also DosDude's patcher is doing a lot of things to keep this rig going at that point.\nBig Sur presumably does not work on the 2008 machine.\nIn my own experience, I found that Mojave (10.14) was where it started to get a bit painful. I was able to get along with a Radeon 270X GPU, but there were a number of places in the OS where things were just really slow and you could tell that the MacPro3,1 was struggling. It was at that time that I realized 12 years was pretty good for the box and it was time to retire it instead of throwing any more cash into it.\nThat being said, it does work very well as a Windows 10 box if you want to get a few more years out of it!\n", "Q: Safari for OS X displaying wrong favicon I am using Safari 9.0.3 on OS X 10.11.9 and have only recently noticed Safari displaying the wrong favicon for some websites.\nIn one instance, Safari uses the Facebook icon for Messenger despite the Messenger icon being used in the head section of the page source.\nI tried deleting the WebpageIcons.db file from Safari's Library folder, and I have cleared Safari history and website data across all my devices.\nThe Facebook icon still loads.\nAny ideas?\nEdit: To clarify, the proper Messenger.com icon appears in the bookmarks menu and the bookmarks editor window. However, the Facebook.com icon is used in the Smart Search Field.\nScreenshot of Safari using the wrong favicon:\n\nFacebook's Messenger.com icon:\n\n\nA: You aren't actually looking at the favicon, but rather the Touch Icon. You can find your Touch Icons in ~/Library/Safari/Touch Icons Cache/ and then look in the Images/ folder to find the actual image files.\n\nYour choice here is you can replace the offending image with the one you want and restart Safari to have it load that, or just trash the whole Touch Icons Cache folder entirely.\n\nA: There are many complicated rules on what icon file gets displayed in a browser, depending on the combination of \"link\" HTML tag used and browser/OS version.\nThe following will help to understand better (in order of preference):\n- search for Favicon on Wikipedia\n- http://blog.iconfactory.com/2015/11/the-new-favicon/\n- http://evotec.pl/mac-os-x-yosemite-missing-favicons-in-safari-8/ \n", "Q: EFI Boot Frozen When Trying to Install Windows 8.1 I am trying to install Windows 8.1 in Bootcamp on my Mac Pro Early 2009 Edition which should be possible according to this page:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ap/HT201457\nI went through all of the steps and got the software onto my USB drive, etc.  When I reboot the mac and hold the option key I see 3 options.  Main, Restore and EFI Boot, however, when I click the EFI boot, the mouse freezes and nothing happens.\nAny ideas on what I should do?\nThanks!\nCraig\n\nA: If you want to EFI boot the installer you need to flash your firmware from MacPro4,1 to MacPro5,1.\nCreate an installer like mentioned here without any bootmgr files to force an EFI boot.\nRemove all disks from Mac Pro to avoid further trouble with Mac EFI looking for MBR or protected MBR.\nEFI boot your installer.\nBe sure to clean the unneeded Bootcamp partition and create GPT install target.\nSee also here.\n\nA: I have a 2007 iMac and a 2011 iMac. I can install both OS X and Ubuntu (Linux) using a flash drive. Both operating systems use the modern EFI/GPT boot/partitioning method. I can not install Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10 using a flash drive on either model. Rather, I use a reusable RW DVD and install using the legacy BIOS/MBR boot/partition method. When holding down the alt/option key at startup, a \"Windows\" labeled icon indicates a BIOS/MBR install. A \"EFI Boot\" icon represents a EFI/GPT install. Since your Mac is a 2009 model, I would assume the same would apply to you.\nIf you have the iso and are using Yosemite, you can burn a DVD using the Disk Utility. Open the Disk Utility and drag the icon representing the iso file from the Finder to the Disk Utility. Highlight the iso file and click on the Burn icon located at the top of the Disk Utility window. \n", "Q: How do I see the number for an unknown caller who is not in my contact list? I have an iphone 4 and although I get a notification for a missed call but i cant see the number of the person calling all it shows is missed call from \"unknown\" i cant find anything on the internet regarding a fix or a setting? please help, if a person calls me and they're not in my contact list i can never call back cause i don't know who called? this is extremely frustrating!\n\nA: Whether the caller's number shown or not does not depend on your contact list. It is the information which is provided by the carrier (AND the caller because the caller can disable it and you won't see any number even if the caller is in your contact list).\nIf you see \"unknown\" that means the CallerID was not provided. If it's provided then you would see the number of the callers even if they're not in your contact list.\n", "Q: Apple Mail 9.2: How to specify port and SSL options for incoming and outgoing IMAP servers? When setting up a new IMAP account in Apple Mail 9.2, it gives me no option to specify the incoming and outgoing ports, not SSL options. See screenshot below.\nThe ability to do this would be most helpful as some mail accounts do vary from the norm in terms of default ports and SSL. When I do fill in all the fields asked for, I get the spinning progress animation for a long time before it gives up with an error (shown). I have no idea if it had tried several different ports (including the ones I want to use) or if it just kept retrying on the same (wrong settings). \nOther email clients give the option to set the ports. At the moment I don't have these available and need to use Apple Mail.\n\n\nA: OK... this is irritating, but possible... you used to be able to force it to ignore at that point, then set it up manually from the Accounts pane.\nThe El Capitan version looks like you need to do that initial setup from System Prefs > Internet Accounts, rather than directly in Mail itself.\nStart from the right pane - 'Add Other Account...' [scroll down to see it, for some reason the + - buttons are unclickable. If you do, they grey out]\nthen Mail Account.\nYou get a very similar dialog as in your question - fill it in as before.\nIt will error, as before - the major difference being that 'Sign In' changes to 'Next'\n& you're in... hit Next & select Mail &/or Notes & Done.\nClose the Prefs.\nIf Mail is open, quit & relaunch.\nMail prefs/Accounts now has the bare bones of your new account, from which you can manually set up all the necessary ports, using the Advanced tab for incoming prefs & the still rather annoying Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) drop menu for outgoing.  \n", "Q: How to record audio from an application/audio device? My nephew is gonna be on the radio tonight. I'd like to record the stream either from iTunes or from my web browser.\nWhat are my options to accomplish that?\n\nA: VLC has an option for listening to network streams, so if VLC is compatible with the stream that you want to listen to it also offers an option for saving that stream to your HD. In the dialog box that lets you enter the stream URL there is a drop down menu by the OPEN button that lets you save the stream.\nOf course this does depend on if VLC will open the specific stream you want it to. Many streaming services use special players and DRM to prevent such things. Failing the VLC method Tetsujin has an excellent recommendation in Audio Hijack as it doesn't care about any of that and just records all the audio passing through your Mac.\n\nA: I'm not aware of any recording feature in iTunes for Internet radios. Check if the specific radio station has a webpage/webstream and you might be able to record that via your standard audio recorder in the OS of your choice.\nIf you have access to an iOS device, the app Audials has a recording option and it's free of charge.\n", "Q: Debugging Mail.app rules Is there a way to see what Mail.app is doing when it scans messages for rule firing?  I have a rules that download bank statements when I get an email from my bank.  Since I have multiple accounts, I rely on the account number in the email message.  I have a number of rules, each having a filter that says \n\nMessage content contains The statement for your account ending in XXXXX is available online for viewing\n\nwhere XXXXX is the particular account number.  The problem is that the first rule always fires no matter what account number is in the message.\n\nA: Simplify it to \nMessage content contains 'XXXXX'\n\n& add 'Stop evaluating Rules' as your last action in the Rule.\nOr, if the number may possibly occur in other emails, make the rule.\nAll \nMessage content contains 'The statement for your account ending in'  \nMessage content contains 'XXXXX'\n\nAdding 'Stop evaluating Rules' is a sensible precaution for all rules that should stop at that point.\n\nA: I've been building this rule one entry at a time and testing using ⌘⌥L.  Things would work for a few runs, but then stop.  It turns out that quitting Mail and restarting will make the rule run just fine (for at least a few more times).\n", "Q: opening two remote screen sharing on the same client I have a macbook and I connect to my linux accounts with screen sharing. I would like to connect to two different linux accounts from the same client (my macbook) at the same time, using two different instances of screen sharing. Is this possible? How?\n\nA: Just make a New Connection\nFor the purposes of answering this question, I have connected to two separate Macs - an XServe that I use for Dev purposes and a colleagues MacBook Pro - at the same time.  All my FreeBSD (alternative to Linux)  servers are \"headless\" and have no GUIs installed - everything is done via command line, so I can't show it connecting to a *nix machine GUI specifically.\n\nTo do this, just open a new session in Screen Sharing by clicking \"New\" on the Screen Sharing menu (top bar) or in Connect to Server (CmdK) and entering vnc://<servername or ip address>\nI haven't tested the limit, but I am sure you can add more screens as needed.\n", "Q: El Capitan + Microsoft Office 2016 + Category Shortcut I am trying to add shortcut for Microsoft Outlook categories.

What can I do? I am installing OS X El Capitan on a Mid 2009 MacBook Pro. Previously running an OS X 10.8.5. Incidentally my installation is taking now two days. I have tried holding down the power button but still no difference. It resumes where it stopped I feel frustrated and I want to return to my previous operation system. What can I do? Does it mean my machine has crashed? have I lost or can I recover my work? Making matters worse I can't tell what percentage of installation achieved? Apart from the bar that has moved from 0% up to around 75% and it's stagnant at that level. I am confused on what to do.\nAny assistance?\n\nA: Theres not much you can do if it still says installing after all that, i think the best and safest thing you can do now is book an appointment at the apple store. You could tamper with it and maybe fix it but at this point in my opinion just take in to the store.\n\nA: There is an installation problem - 2 days is way to long; 1 day is actually way too long.\nI personally upgraded a colleagues 2009 MBP to El Capitan with no issues.  However, prior to the upgrade, I upgraded it to 8GB of RAM and added a Samsung SSD (solid state drive).  The links I provided were for the exact products that I used.  Installation of El Capitan took around an hour total (I didn't hang around to watch/time it)\nThe reason for the upgrade was that the original TSM (traditional spinning media) HDD that came with it was dying.  Booting started taking up to 10 minutes and browsing the web became unbarable.  You might be experiencing that same problem.  Use DriveDX (free option) to determine if drive is failing (which is what I am suspecting).\nAs always, make sure you do a Time Machine backup of your drive before the upgrade.  However, (IMO) just migrate over your data.  Do a nice clean installation of El Capitan and all the applications you have - it's been my experience that computers are much more stable when doing clean installs rather than in-place upgrades and/or backup/restore of apps.\n", "Q: Change MAC address in Yosemite To change the MAC address I use the common\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport -z\nsudo ifconfig en0 ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\nnetworksetup -detectnewhardware\n\nIt shows the changed MAC address when I run\nifconfig en0 |grep ether\n\nIs this sufficient or should the changed address also appear in System Preferences -> Network and in the extended Wi-Fi details sub menu (alt+click on Wi-Fi symbol)? In both places the original MAC address is still shown although Terminal gives a different address.\n\nA: This should be sufficient. After changing the MAC address this way you could use e.g. Wireshark to capture the network traffic. The new MAC address should be shown there. At least this works on my macbook. \n\nA: Theoretically it is this sufficient.

I'll need to install Visual Studio and some other tools on the Windows system, so I need quite a bit of storage, maybe around 100 GB should be enough. There are very small USB flash drives with capacity of up to 256 GB, would it be a good idea to run the VM on that? I want to avoid using a big external hard drive, since they are not really convenient, just too big. Also, I don't have enough storage on the local SSD drive.\n\nA: Running the VM from a USB drive is definitely possible, but far from optimal.\nI use VM for running Project and Visio on my mac (never from USB though), and it made a huge difference when I switched to SSD.\nSome numbers: A decent internal SSD will have a speed (sequential read/write) of around 500 MB/s while a fast external SSD will do around 300 MB/s, and a top notch USB 3.0 drive will be around 140 MB/s (a lot USB 3.0 drives are bellow 20 MB/s)  - Source: SSD Benchmarks, USB Benchmarks\nTo put this into perspective, a top notch usb drive should perform nearly as well as an old hard disk drive, so it's definitely viable. But it will only be half as fast as a good external SSD drive and 1/3 as fast as your internal drive.\nThis makes a huge difference when running VMs. Keep in mind the bottleneck here is the actual read/write operations on the drive, since the USB/Thunderbolt bandwidth allows for much greater speeds.\nWhatever you chose, make sure you're getting a fast performance unit, since speed is very important for VMs. I really recommend making sure you get a Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 drive.\n\nA: Running a VM off of USB isn't advisable unless you have no other options; it will be painfully slow as other have already answered.\nOn my iMac, I run several VirtualBox VMs (Windows 7, Win10, Server 2012, and FreeBSD). FreeBSD and Win10 run all the time, the others only when I am doing something specific.   My Windows 10 machine is the only one on my internal drive, but the others are located on the WD Thunderbolt Drive and they boot and perform perfectly well; I have no complaints.   \nIncidentally, I use my Windows VM for exactly the same reasons you do - Visio, Project and some features in OneNote that haven't made it to the Mac version. \nAs for the external drives being too big, I definitely see your point, but the one thing in their favor is that I am able to use \"enterprise grade\" drives which are designed for 24/7 use and thusly it has been extremely reliable with absolutely no downtime where as I just had to replace a portable drive (which I never left my desk) after about 18 months.  It was a trade off I will willing to make.\nI have been evaluating switching to a portable drive like the Transcend model but since my iMac (by design) doesn't go anywhere, it's not a critical issue for me.

I can detect successful login via ssh running a program under Java 1.7 with export AWT_TOOLKIT=CToolkit that tries to open an AWT window as the secondary user, which fails if the desktop isn't started.\nThis is fairly reliable, although I'd happily hear of more reliable methods!\nWhere things are going wrong:\nWe're having problems logging those robot users out, to leave the machine fresh for other tests that object to all the memory wasted by stray processes the users leave running.\nI'm currently using\nfor i in $users ; do\n  ssh ${i}@localhost \"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"System Events\\\"'\n                                  -e 'log out'\n                                  -e 'delay 3'\n                                  -e 'keystroke return'\n                                -e end\" &\ndone; wait\n\nbut sometimes System Events apparently isn't running and refuses to start:\n33:40: execution error: System Events got an error: Application isn’t running.

My storage says I have 0 bytes available, and I can't do anything that changes it.  I've tried a reset (power+home).  It says I have 180M in photos, however I did go delete a bunch and the number didn't change.  I don't have iTunes, it's not connected to a PC, I don't have music or videos on it.\nHow can I free up space?  How can I delete files (pictures, apps) and have the system acknowledge the change?  This is seriously frustrating that I can't manage the space usage on the device.\n\nA: For anyone else in this situation, I'm posting my experience.  I did install iTunes and do a backup/restore, but that didn't fix it.  It did help me see that, in fact, there was a huge chuck of data marked as \"other\" - this is what most forum posts describe.  I began deleting apps to see if I could figure out which was responsible, but nothing reduced that wasted space.  Finally, I was forced to accept the unpleasant reality.  Yes, you have to wipe your phone. Since I had a backup, I went to Settings -> General -> Reset (at the bottom) -> Erase All Content and Settings.  After, I used iTunes to do a restore. This brought back pretty much everything the way I had it.  However, apps that I deleted I had to search and reinstall from the AppStore.  (Why don't they have a \"my apps\" list like Amazon does?)\n\nA: If you have any partially downloaded app, large file etc. which has not been removed, this can occur. Clear cache or delete partially downloaded large file and that resolve your problem. A quick glance on how to clean the cache in an iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap Settings app → General → iPhone Storage. (On an iPad that option will be labelled iPad Storage.)\n\n*At the bottom of the screen you'll see your apps, arranged by the amount of storage they take up.\n\n*Tap an app that's taking up a lot of space (In this case application download data and store them in a location of the iPhone).\n\n*Take a look at the entry for Documents & Data. If it's using more than 500MB, it's worth deleting and reinstalling the app to clear the space. Tap Delete App (Note: This will delete any user data associated with the app, so proceed with caution).\n\nA: Don't worry. There are several questions for you: Have you updated your iPhone to latest iOS version? Have you checked your \"Recently deleted\" album and deleted them? Have you installed the app \"WhatsApp\"? Seems it was the app \"WhatsApp\", creating lots of cache files and stealing storage from the phone. You can try to install the update and see whether the storage came back to a normal level.

I continued to enjoy the snapping operating system until one day my laptop's SATA cable decided to give up on me. I got the cable replaced and then ended up having to reformat everything and restart over. That's when I made the decision of moving from the public beta to the official release, because I had been facing minor bluetooth connectivity issues.

The good news is that it is not very expensive.\nYour Macbook which identified by DriveDX as a MacBookPro9,2 (Mid 2012) uses a standard SATA drive and you can upgrade to an SSD and increase your performance dramatically pretty inexpensively (at the time of this, they are trending about $150 USD).  I have used Samsung drives with great success.  Changing it out only requires removing 10 phillips screws.\nI have more info on how to do this on this post:  My Mac is getting really slow, what should I do?\nIMO, I would keep this running for a few more year because Apple has now made it impossible to upgrade your RAM or HDD meaning you must configure it with what you hope you are going to need in the future.\n", "Q: Does an iOS virtual machine exist for Windows? Does an iOS virtual machine for Windows exist? If it doesn't are there any reason why it couldn't?\n\nA: Simple answer: No. \nApple does not allow iOS to run anywhere else but iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch) and the Xcode simulator. You could simulate OS X on your Windows VM application and then use Xcode to simulate an iOS device, but this would be really taxing on your computer and really not worth the effort, but you cannot simulate iOS directly on Windows because of chipsets and Apple preventing it.\n", "Q: Resolution problem on external display with Thunderbolt->HDMI adapter Let me explain problem in quick bullets:\nWhat I want:\nI would like to use ultra wide external display with 3440x1440@50hz resolution with my MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012).\nI would like to use my Thunderbolt port on mac, and my HDMI 1.4 input on my display.\nI can successfully connect my display using:\n- HDMI -> HDMI with 3440x1440@50hz\n- TB -> DP (via TB -> DP adapter) with 3440x1440@50hz\nI can partially successfully (with limited resolution) connect my display using:\n- TB -> HDMI (via TB -> HDMI adpater) with 1920x1080@60hz (max)\nQuestion is:\nIs it matter of my adapter?

However my Dell M90 has a bad optical drive and scratches discs. So I used my MBP and Toast Titanium 11.0.2 to create ISOs of all the DVDs.\nI tried to boot from USB on the Dell M90, but I cannot get it to \"see\" the first ISO (plus I have many other ISOs on that external drive). I have a 8GB PNY thumb drive but cannot get the first ISO onto the drive so I can boot from it - that option is no longer in Disk Utility (grrr) and Toast doesn't seem to offer that ability (it only offers optical discs as a destination).\nDoes anyone know of a way to get an ISO onto a bootable USB flash drive? I also cannot connect to a network until the image (all 7 discs) are installed and the image boots up.\n\nA: Windows 7 (any version) fits on one disk of any optical media, not sure what is going on with what you have or exactly what it is, that said...\nYou can't boot from an ISO, you need to burn it to CD/DVD or install it to an external drive of some sort in a way that makes it bootable.\nDepending on what is going on here you may be able to use Disk Utility.app to create either optical media or a USB drive that is bootable.\nOpen Disk Utility and select \"Scan image for restore\" and select the ISO. Attach your USB drive and restore the ISO to that USB drive, which should (I believe, it's been a while since I tried this...) give you a bootable Windows install disk.\nAlso depending on which Mac you have and the OS version BootCamp assistant may be able to create a bootable Windows 7 installer.\n", "Q: I can't delete characters in tmux on macOS I have searched around and the closes thing I could find to my issue is this:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/23848061/cannot-get-delete-key-to-work-with-tmux-and-osx\nI am running multiple versions of OSX and macOS and I am using iTerm2.\nWhen I go into a tmux session my delete key does not work.

Windows will ask if you want to check for errors, OS X does it invisibly.\nUSB3 disks often disconnect inexplicably in OS X. If the disk hasn't been used for hours I know there is no issue. On Windows, I can simply decline to run the check. On OS X I just have to sit waiting for 30 minutes while the fsck thrashes my disk. This happens daily, so OS X will rapidly kill my hard drive. (This paragraph has been edited since the answers were posted.)\nHow can I disable this check? Can I connect via a non-native driver? Can I run something to flip the flag on the disk that tells OS X the disk was improperly disconnected? Can I change disk format? Can I disable whatever it is that sets the flag 'improperly disconnected' when I connect the drive, that is then unset on proper ejection? I'm desperate, as the Mac has a tiny hard disk and now I can't use externals. Any direction, no matter how hacky or improper, gratefully received! I have tried accessing the drive through Windows in VirtualBox or Parallels, but they can't see the drive until OS X has stopped fsck.\nI believe File System State is the state/setting I need to ignore/override.\nThe disk is exFat with Master Boot Record, and OS X is 10.11.3. Update: this has now happened on the other USB socket with a flash disk (I'd only seen this on an HDDs that report themselves as non-removable before).\nThere isn't an Apple repair centre in the country I live in, the disk isn't used for frequently accessed files, I would do a check if there was a chance of corruption (ie, a disconnection during or shortly after a write to the disk), and I've always declined the check in Windows (for decades) because the only time I've had a corruption is from the check itself. \n\nA: Open Terminal and enter:\n#Get the disk identifier of the ExFAT partition\ndiskutil list\n#Get the UUID of the ExFAT volume with diskXsY being its disk identifier\ndiskutil info /dev/diskXsY\n#Create and edit /etc/fstab \nsudo vifs\n\nAdd a line with the following content after activating insert mode (e.g with I)\n#Replace the UUID below by the one found earlier!\nUUID=2FECDB7A-15F0-36F9-9A47-483B9669D6DC none exfat rw,auto 0 0\n\nHit esc to leave insert mode. Enter :w! to write the file to disk and :q to quit vifs.\nReboot your Mac.\nThe last 0 should disable fsck.\n\nAn alternative method may be: rename /sbin/fsck_exfat to /sbin/fsck_exfat.paralyzed with:\nsudo mv /sbin/fsck_exfat /sbin/fsck_exfat.paralyzed\n\nSince /sbin/fsck_exfat is a link only you may also have to rename the original file: /System/Library/Filesystems/exfat.fs/Contents/Resources/fsck_exfat.\n\nBoth methods are not recommended! Instead the USB socket should be repaired.\n", "Q: Can ransomware infect iCloud Drive? I have all Apple products in my household, and am very security conscious. But the recent articles about ransomware infecting all sorts of computers got me thinking. \nEven if I was foolish enough to find a Mac ransomware program, download it, disable Sophos, disable SIP, and give said ransomware program my admin credentials, could it infect my iCloud Drive? I have regular hourly backups to my Time Machine so I am not worried about my data stored locally, but iCloud Drive items are stored on Apple's Servers as well as on my computer. So if ransomware encrypted all of my content in my iCloud Drive folder on my computer, would it update the files on the server, making recovery not possible?\nFor clarification, my questions are these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the iCloud Drive folder get backed up to my Time Machine?\n\n*Does Apple make regular accessible backups of their user's content?\n\n*Would the encrypted data be uploaded to iCloud replacing the old files on the server?\n\n\nA: In short, yes, it is quite possible for ransomware to encrypt the contents of your iCloud Drive. It is possible for the ransomware to encrypt the data of your iCloud Drive, and then your computer would sync the changes to Apple's cloud, requiring decryption to access the data again.\nTo answer your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Probably. The iCloud Drive folder is stored locally on your computer in /YourUserName/Library/Mobile Documents. It would be getting backed up unless you have specifically told Time Machine to not back up this directory.\n\n*No. Apple does not make backups of a user's iCloud Drive accessible. It is unclear if Apple even keeps copies of user's iCloud Drive, but they are most certainly not accessible to the users.\n\n*Yes. If ransomware encrypts the files in the directory /YourUserName/Library/Mobile Documents then the changes would be applied to your iCloud Drive, rendering the information useless without decrypting the data.\n\n", "Q: How to edit WebM video files on Mac?

The Android device images are not bootable images or installers or something. They contain a packed copy of the Android OS specifically built for the targeted device as well as all required hardware drivers. No virtualisation software will find any bootable code in such a firmware file.\nAlso most VMMs (including Parallels) virtualise x86/x64 processors, while almost all Android devies use an ARM processor.

It overheats for no particular reason. It cools down for no particular reason too. It goes from 89 to 65 in seconds regardless of applications usage that I do.

However, a 24 degree temp swing in a couple of seconds is a lot.  \nHave you tried AHT (Apple Hardware Test)?\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257\nMy thinking is that you may have a bad temperature sensor (or it's getting bad info).\nIf that's the case, there are folks who repair things like this, or it just may be a good reason to upgrade your Mac.  There is a guy in NY that does really good work (I am not affiliated) repairing these boards:  https://mailin.repair/\n\nA: I went on and opened the Macbook, detached the ventilator fan, cleaned it - there was a thick dust ball underneath it somewhere, returned everything back and voila!

I have used the recovery console to install OS X onto a USB drive and have booted into that and can't actually see the internal disk at all. \nIf I boot to Recovery Mode and open Disk Utility I can see it fine in there, and can see the files on it. If I check the disk using the repair option it also verifies fine. \nIf I take the drive out and put it in a USB caddy I can pull off all the files just fine using HSFExplorer on a PC, and have backed up most to an external drive from the PC. I can't quite work out why the Mac won't boot though as according to Disk Utility it's fine, but from inside OS X it cannot be seen, and also booting off it gives a question mark.\n\nA: The question mark means that it cannot find its boot partition.  On any OS X drive, you are going to have several partitions.  It might look something like:\n #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *55.9 Gi    disk0\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         31.5 Ki    disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_Boot Boot OSX                128.0 Mi   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_HFSX Macintosh HD0           25.0 Gi    disk0s3\n   4:                 Apple_Boot                         128.0 Mi   disk0s4\n\nUsing this drive as an example, you can probably see what is on \"Macintosh HD0\" which is disk0s3.  To boot, you need the \"Apple_Boot\" partition or disk0s4 partition.\nYou should be able to fix this by running the installer and having it repair the OS X installation.  \nMake sure you back up your files first (it sounds like you did).\n\nA: This turned out to be the hard drive cable, once I replaced that it was back to working as normal.\n", "Q: How to disable app relaunch and window restore in El Capitan on reboot? How do I disable  both the \"relaunch apps after reboot\" feature as well as the \"reopen windows at relaunch\" feature?  When I reboot (be it after a hard reset or reboot command) I want to be presented with a blank desktop and not everything I had open before.  Also, when I open an application, I don't want the dozen things I was working on previously to open all at once.\n\nA: The approach I've had success with is basically the locked-file approach by John Smfifth, after emptying the file. The nice thing about it is that it can be done without root rights and using a simple two-line shell script:\n# clear the file if it isn't empty\nfind ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/ -name 'com.apple.loginwindow*' ! -size 0 -exec tee {} \\; < /dev/null\n# set the user immutable flag\nfind ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/ -name 'com.apple.loginwindow*' -exec chflags uimmutable {} \\;\n\n\nA: The simplest solution and the one I use, is to locate the file in finder: ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow\nThen either close all applications to empty the above files contents, or preferably just open the file in Text Edit and delete all contents then save it.\nThen, reselect the file in finder but do not open it\nThen, press the Apple key (next to space-bar) + i, or go to file menu and click \"Get Info\". Then under the General section of the displayed information window, check the \"Locked\" selection box (file is then locked).\nUsing this method it's much easier to enable or un-enable, as the process is much simpler to remember. Terminal code you use occasionally is not likely to be easily remembered or retrieved.\n\nA: If you are looking for a way to permanently disable this feature so you don't have to remember the extra \"uncheck the box\" step every time you turn your machine off, you can simply deny OS X access to the file it uses to store your session state.\nIn a terminal,\n# Make the file owned by root (otherwise the OS will just replace it)\nsudo chown root ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow*\n\n# Remove all permissions, so it can't be read or written to\nsudo chmod 000 ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow*\n\nIf you wish to undo this change later and re-enable the feature, perhaps because you've suffered brain damage and now find boot-looping amusing, simply delete this file and the OS will recreate it.\n# Re-enable El Capitan's obnoxious \"relaunch all the things\" behavior\nsudo rm -f ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow*\n\n\nA: To keep applications from opening previous documents, go to System Preferences > General and tick the Close windows when quitting an app checkbox.\n\nTo keep the relaunch apps after reboot from occurring, un-tick the checkbox on the Shutdown or Restart pop-up window:\n\n", "Q: Why does the highlighted text color in Xcode's Project Navigator sometimes switch to white with a blue shadow? Normally a selected item in Xcode's Project Navigator is indicated by a blue bar behind the item. However, sometimes for no apparent reason this changes to white text with a kind of very light blue drop shadow and no background color change. Does anyone know why this occurs  or how to prevent it? To fix it I always just have to restart Xcode.\n\nI'm using Xcode 7.2.1 (7C1002) on an OSX El Capitan 10.11.3 machine.\n\nA: It's just a bug which happens sometimes in Xcode, still happening in 8.1.\nYou don't have to restart to fix it, you can just hide and show the navigator by clicking this button twice:\n\n\nA: I am experiencing the same issue with Xcode 7 (all versions). I have to relaunch the Xcode project to correct the highlighting.\n\nA: In my case I was using multiple tabs. I just closed all the tabs leaving only one opened. \nIt's a very dangerous bug, it reverted my info.plist file to an older version.\n\nA: This happens if you lower your brightness in the display...increase it and it will be fixed...\n", "Q: How to make .docx files open in Pages by default Is there a way to make .docx (Word) files open in Pages by default?

Note that an iPad will change much slower on a 5W. \nThis doesn't apply to the iPad Pro (12\" model requires a 12W charger)\niPhones and most iPods use a 5W charger.\niPad mini and 9.7\" iPads use a 10W charger.\niPad Pro 12\" use a 12W charger.\nThis is also true for other products by Apple such as the MacBooks. All MacBooks will charge off an 85W charger with the correct MagSafe connector. 13\", 15\" and 17\" MacBooks will charge with a 45, 60, or 85W chargers, however if you use intense processing on a 15\" or 17\" connected to a 60W or 45W charger the computer will still lose charge but at a much slower rate than if no changer is attached at all. If you don't believe me try exporting a movie from Final Cut or iMovie while on a charger that has a lower Watt rating then the machine would prefer. It will slowly discharge the machine\nWhile all of the above is true, Apple still insists that you should use the correct charger for your device - however it's completely non-essential.\nMake sure you have a look at the Apple website as well because they have a recall for the plug part of your charger. They have found that some of them are quite dangerous and can give you a good zap if you aren't careful.\n\nA: Absolutely. Devices draw only the amount of power that they need, so having extra amps of power available isn't a problem.\nThe thing you usually have to be careful about is matching voltages\nBoth the iPad chargers work at 5 volts, so you're good to go.\n", "Q: Shortcut for [return] key How do I make a keyboard shortcut for the return key? For example, if I pressed ~ it would press return for me. I'd like to do this without applescript. Is this possible, or will I have to buy a functioning external keyboard because my return key doesn't work!\n\nA: Download, install and start Karabiner. In the menubar open (Karabiner icon)-> Preferences. Enter \"Return\" in the search field and choose one of the preconfigured key codes:\n\nBy editing the private.xml in Misc & Uninstall  you may add any additional  key or (not already used) key combination and choose this one instead.\n\nA: You can do this without being admin on your Mac, and with a simple creation of a key binding file.\nCreate a file (on a standard install, the directory KeyBindings doesn't exist):\nmkdir ~/Library/KeyBindings\n\ncontaining the following remapping:\n$ cat >~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict <<end_of_file\n/* my keybindings */\n{\n        \"\\U007e\" = (\"insertNewline:\") ;\n}\nend_of_file\n\n\\U007e means Unicode of the standard ~ character (== 0x7e). You can't use \"~\" in this dictionary because it means option.\n(I suggest to avoid the use of the character ~ because it is used\nin command environnment to mean ${HOME}. For example if you want to\nuse option+/, put \"~/\" in place of \"\\U007e\".)\nAnd restart your session.\nTo suppress this key binding, just remove this file:\nrm ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict\n\nand if you dont need it, remove also the useless directory:\nrmdir ~/Library/KeyBindings\n\nand restart your session.\n", "Q: How to send an email to myself with Applescript or Terminal automatically when my Mac reboots? I wonder if there is a way to send an email to myself with Command Line or AppleScript service automatically when my Mac reboots? Thanks for your suggestions.\n\nA: The easiest way I know of to do this is add a line to your crontab with the following format:\n@reboot /path/to/your/script\n\nThe script could have the mail command invoking the date command.\n\nA: You could use an AppleScript like this, saved as an application:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set my_message to make new outgoing message\n    set subject of my_message to \"I restarted.\"\n    set content of my_message to \"Not sure why it happened...\"\n    set sender of my_message to \"macman@christianboyce.com\"\n    --\n    tell my_message\n        make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {name:\"macman@christianboyce.com\"}\n    end tell\n    --\n    send my_message\nend tell\n\nObviously you would change the sender and \"to recipient\" to your own email address. \nYou could then take the script, saved as an application, and add it to your login items. (This assumes that your Mac is set to login automatically.) See the picture. Last item shown in my login items is the script application.\n\nThe key to this is saving the script as an application. That way, rather than opening the script, you're executing it.\n", "Q: When will podcasts be automatically deleted in iTunes? I've heard that downloaded podcasts that are visited would be automatically deleted after some time. But I'm not sure about when or which condition does this occur. \nWhen will the downloaded podcast episodes be automatically deleted if not saved? How to control this event? \n\nA: You can set this for each podcast subscription. Click on the Gear icon at the top of a podcast list to bring up the Podcast Settings dialog. \nThe 'Limit Episodes' choice gives you a number of ways to set how many podcasts are retained, including no limit.\n", "Q: My terminal keeps printing \"emergency\" messages I keep getting these broadcast messages being printed to every terminal window, and it's driving me nuts.

In Windows I used to have a program (or actually a background service) in which I could define shortcuts or abbreviations, which would automatically expand to full sentences or phrases wherever I type them.\nFor example, when I type: (in any program or context)\nbr`\n\nIt would automatically be replaced with:\nBest regards,\n\nRocketnuts.\n\nAnd I could define and customize tons of personal 'text shortcuts' like these. It helped me a great deal in typing texts faster and more efficient.\nNote that the backtick character was to invoke the replacement (could also be customized to something else, like ~).\nQuestion: Is there a way to pull this off in OS X? (FYI: I'm using OS X El Capitan 10.11.3)\nI've heard it ought to be possible with OS X's native keyboard / text settings, by defining autocorrect entries, but could not find a way to get that to work as described above.\nNote that I absolutely don't want to enable dictionary-based autocorrection (that drives me crazy, as I often type in multiple languages).\n\nA: Yes, it's built into the system [& can also share with any iOS devices you may have]\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Text\nThere are a few there to start you off - if you don't want them, select & hit the - button beneath.\n\nAdding a new one is as simple as hitting the + button, type your trigger on the left [it wants something nice & alphanumeric as a trigger, no punctuation]\nThe output can be pretty much anything you can imagine, including multi-line text, however, to get multi-line into it you need to copy/paste it from somewhere else, like TextEdit.  \nThe auto-generation of the shortcut in daily use is inter-dependant on your general spelling auto-correct settings, which will change its behaviour from only replacing on completion of the trigger then hitting Space, or offer to fill as soon as it thinks it has recognised what you are going to input.\nI use it for anything from generating my signature, markup in Stack Exchange, to correcting some of my favourite typos that regular autocorrect doesn't seem to pick up.\n\n", "Q: How does iPhone's compass work? How exactly does iPhone's Compass app work? Is there some kind of chip sensitive to Earth's magnetic field or does it deduce the device's orientation from GPS and other location data? Or a combination of both?\nIf there are differences among different models of iPhone, of course I'd be interested in learning them. Is the iPhone 7 different in this regard?\n\nA: The iPhone 5s Compass app reacts to a magnet.  This proves that it uses a magnetic sensor.\n\nA: There's a lot of online speculation on this, and some of it is laughable. Disclaimer: I use Apple products, but otherwise have no affiliation and know nothing with certainty. But, I have a very strong hunch that the the iPhone in all versions uses a device called a magnetometer for the compass. ICYI, the compass reading is combined with inertial data generated by accelerometers in the iPhone and GPS data from its receiver (when available) to calculate the phone's position using a technique known as Kalman filtering. \n", "Q: How to copy a file and replace (if necessary) in the target directory from terminal If I'm on my Desktop and I have a file called 'test.txt' on there, and I want to copy that file to say '~/Library/Folder 1/Folder 2/' how do I do that? Also, if there's already a file there called 'test.txt' I'd like to replace that file.\nI've tried running \ncp -R ./test.txt ~/Library/Folder 1/Folder 2/ \n\nbut that didn't do the trick.\n\nA: First things first, -R is used for recursive copying, which won't do anything for a single file. \ncp default behavior is to overwrite the existing file. \ncp test.txt ~/Library/Folder\\ 1/Folder\\ 2/\n\nThe backslash is used to stop the string being split on the spaces. \n", "Q: Port forwarding in OS X 10.10 I have to forward every internet page to my local address i.e. 127.0.0.1 using OS X.\nI tried following command but it has no effect:\necho \" rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080 \" | sudo pfctl -ef -\n\nI have tried to research the exact meaning of the above line but I can't find a good explanation.

The solution there may be adapted to OS X under certain circumstances.\n\nThe rule rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080 does the following:\nrdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080\n|   |    |              |\n|   |    |              #from any IP (all source IPs) to any IP (all destination IPs of the local machine)\n|   |    |              from any to any\n|   |    #IPv4 Protocol TCP\n|   |    inet proto tcp\n|   #allow\n|   pass\n#redirect from port 80 to localhost:8080\nrdr                                     port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080\n\nOr: any incoming (rdr only redirects incoming packets) IPv4 TCP traffic (on any interface) to port 80 from any IP to any IP (on any interface) of the local machine is passed and redirected to 127.0.0.1:8080. \nThe rule doesn't redirect requests from a local client machine for google.com:80 (i.e. 216.58.201.206:80) or 175.68.9.102:80 to 127.0.0.1:80 because neither of these IPs is an IP of the local (www-)server machine nor does the local (www-)server know of the requests.\nThis doesn't apply to outgoing traffic of the local machine because that's no incoming traffic.

And I'm about to buy this Samsung SSD. But one question went threw my mind.\nAfter I physically install the SSD in the computer, how do I install the OS? I want to do a fresh install, but will there be a menu that asks me what I want to do with this new SSD, whether I want to import data from my old hard drive, or completely reinstall an OS?\nI think I will need a USB stick with the El Capitan installer, but how will I proceed next?\n\nA: If your HDD is still mounted you can download El Capitan from the Apple App Store and create a USB installer thumb drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the OS X installer from the Mac App Store. Quit the installer if it opens automatically after downloading. The installer will be in your Applications folder.\n\n*Mount your USB flash drive or other volume. You could also use a secondary internal partition. Partition the thumb drive with Disk Utility: one partition, Mac OS X Extended Journaled and GUID partition table and rename it (e.g. MyVolume).\n\n*Open the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.\n\n*Use the createinstallmedia command in Terminal to create the bootable installer. Examples of this command are in the next section. For detailed usage instructions, make sure that the appropriate Install OS X app is in your Applications folder, then enter one of the following paths in Terminal:\n#with MyVolume: the name of your USB thumb drive volume\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\n\n*Shutdown your Mac and replace the hard drive.\n\n*Boot your Mac - you may have to hold the alt/opt and choose the installer thumb drive as boot volume. Sometimes this doesn't work on the first attempt. Just reboot again!\n\n*Partition the SSD with Disk Utility which is included in the installer thumb drive(AFAIR in the menubar -> Utilities): one partition, Mac OS X Extended Journaled and GUID partition table and rename it (e.g. Macintosh HD). Quit Disk Utility and install El Capitan.\n\n\nIf you already attached the SSD you can use Internet Recovery Mode (hold cmdR or altcmdR while booting) to first partition the new internal drive and then restore the original system (10.7 Lion). Then - after configuring Lion - you can to upgrade to El Capitan.

I know /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend command, but it doesn't seem to work via ssh. The perfect solution would be a command, that I could type logged via ssh and it would unlock the screen or lock it back again, so I don't need to tell anybody my password, if he wants to use it. Is there any builtin tool, that would provide such functionality?\n\nA: There are many ways to lock and unlock your Mac via SSH. The easiest and probably the fastest way is to use osascript (applescript).\nLocking Mac\nTo do this, log in via ssh and type in\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to sleep'\n\nYou can switch Finder for System Events, but that means more characters to type.\nUnlocking Mac\nTo wake your Mac is a little harder.\nThere are two ways to do this.\nYou can use osascript again.\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to key code 123'\n\nThis tells it to keystroke the left arrow key which should wake your Mac up from sleep.\nYou can also use the pmset command.\npmset schedule wake \"mm/dd/yyyy 00:00:00\"\n\nUse a date and time that has already passed.\nOf course you will need to keystroke your password via Applescript, e.g.\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"password\"'\n\nAn alternative to this could be the Remote Wake Up app for Mac, but I am not sure if you can put a password in.\n\nA: I use this for locking the screen (works on Big Sur):\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"q\" using {control down, command down}\nend tell'\n\n\nA: I use this:\nsudo -S pmset schedule wake \"$(date -j -v +2S +'%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S')\"\nWakes your Mac up in 2 seconds from now.

I want to know the exact version of an older iPad.\nAfter looking up the serial number, it states iPad2,2. I know it is a second generation iPad, but what does the number after the comma identify?\nDoes this mean this is iPad2 second generation, where iPad2,1 would be iPad2 first generation?\nI thought the generation was the first number, so iPad1 is 1st generation, iPad2 is 2nd, and so on.\nHow do I properly identify iPad2,2 and other iPads?\n\nA: A general statement regarding Model Identifiers (example: iPad1,1) is first number indicates generation and the second number indicates variant. However, there are many instances where simply reading the model identifier and trying to decode it cannot identify a device.\nComprehensive lists are available at EveryI and The iPhone Wiki. Note that there are several instances of overlap (example: iPad1,1 for both WiFi and WiFi+3G models)\nThe model/family/\"A\" number (example: A1234) may also be useful in identifying a given device (though some also overlap, such as A1395 for iPad2,1 and iPad2,4).\nThe model/part/\"M\" number is even better, typically allowing identification of more specific detail.\nThe iPad2,2 specifically refers to the iPad 2 WiFi+3G (GSM). \n", "Q: Can Someone Explain Why These Scripts Work? I'm a brand new AppleScript initiate. I was at a Developer Summit and needed to stop messing with my windows so much. So I looked up scripting the window sizing and positioning.

Then I could position the window like I want and get the settings I needed to apply. I got the settings, and pasted them in the line right before \"end tell\" and they worked.\nI set this as a service and now I can make ANY window (from Service) size to what I needed.\nI arrived home and connected to my dual monitor, a 32\" Acer, and everytime I would run the script in my big monitor it would JUMP to the MacBook Window.\nSo I tweaked this and that, tried several things, looked things up, and during a run did this:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set myTargetApplication to name of the first process whose frontmost is true\nend tell\n\ntell application myTargetApplication\n    --  This line is what we use when we need to grab that bounds of a window.\n    -- set currentBounds to bounds of the first window\n    set bounds of the first window to {1299, 38, 3182, 1062}\nend tell\n\nI did the same thing in Automator... saved as a service... and now they work.\nEXACTLY LIKE I WANT.\nI am not COMPLAINING...

However, having a clone connected to your Mac may present a problem in starting apps automatically, for instance at startup. In some cases OSX will start the app from the clone rather than from the system disk. One of the examples is 1Password, which has a little component, called 1Password Mini, which is starting automatically for each user. The app is not listed in the login items. 1Password Mini is often (or always ?) started from the clone and other components of 1Password, interacting with 1Password Mini (such as the update process) will notice this and issue a message. \nI wonder if there is a way to force apps to be launched from the Applications folder on the System Disk and ignore the one on the clone. Taking the clone offline is not an option for me.\n\nA: The cleanest (and safest; see below) solution would be to set up Carbon Copy Cloner to automatically mount the clone disk/partition before the backup starts and unmount it once the backup is finished. See:\nhttps://bombich.com/kb/ccc4/performing-actions-before-and-after-backup-task\nNot only would this prevent the problems you have described, it would also protect you a bit better against ransomware, which unfortunately made its appearance for the first time on OS X a week ago, because your backup would only be vulnerable during the daily cloning window and not all the time.\nShort of doing something radical such as stripping the executable rights from all your files on the backup disk (which would also break the backup), I don't see how you could prevent applications to be launched from it, and even that might not prevent helper code to be executed by a main application.\nWhat you could do is add the backup disk to System Preferences->Spotlight->Privacy. That would at least prevent you from accidentally launching apps from the wrong disk yourself using Spotlight (or launchers that rely on Spotlight such as Alfred).\n", "Q: What happens to my purchased music if I cancelled my Apple Music subscription? I have a big music library that I assembled through years of purchasing music from iTunes and CDs.\nI would like to give Apple Music a try but what happens to the music that I own? Particularly worried about the music that I bought from iTunes as I paid a lot for that.\n\nA: Your local iTunes library will stay the way it is—with or without an active Apple Music subscription.\nIf you subscribe but decide later on that you do ’t want to use Apple Music any longer, what will happen is that on other devices, that are not your main iTunes library device, you cannot stream songs any longer. Synchronising songs will still work as it did before Apple Music came out.\nWhat you put into your iTunes library before subscribing to Apple Music will stay in there.\n\nTo quote iMore.com’s Apple Music FAQ:\n\nWhat happens if I decide not to subscribe after the three month trial?\nAny streaming music you've added to your library from the Apple Music catalog will no longer be playable; you'll stop having access to Connect content; you'll be skip-limited when listening to Apple Music radio stations; and unless you have iTunes Match enabled, you won't be able to stream your previously purchased and uploaded music to your devices, and any songs from your Mac's library that you've downloaded to other devices will be removed. (Your Mac's original iTunes library remains as-is.)\n\n\nA: Nothing would happen to the music you bought on iTunes or the music that came off of your CD's etc …\nThe music you purchased from iTunes is connected to your iCloud account so that if you try to purchase it again, it knows that you've already purchased it. In addition you'll be able to download your purchased music through iTunes on you Mac, iPhone, iPad etc …\nThe CDs are a different story. If you have the songs on your computer and on your phone and you cancel Apple Music, they'll stay there, but if you delete the songs off of every device they're on then they're gone.\nApple Music stores all the songs you add from Apple Music to “My Music”. If you enable iCloud Music Library, then those songs you added off of Apple Music will be accessible on every other device that has iCloud Music Library enabled as well. You can choose to add said CD songs to your iCloud Music Library and be able to play them on all of your devices. If you decide to cancel Apple Music, all of your songs in “My Music” will no longer be available but all the songs downloaded off of iTunes will be, your CDs won't be accessible through iCloud Music Library unless you pay for that separately. You'll still have your CDs on your computer or wherever the physical copy is.\n\nIn short,\nYou will lose non of your paid iTunes music as you can re-download them off of iTunes.\nYou will lose non of your CD music as long as you don't delete them off of every device.\n\nA: \"Your local iTunes library will stay the way it is—with or without an active Apple Music subscription.\"\nThis is not true. The metadata associated with much of your music will be changed, which is very annoying.\nI have over 50k tracks in my iTunes library, gathered from CDs and downloads since the early 90s.\nApple Music changed the metadata on thousands of tracks, so \"Dylan, Bob\" was changed to \"Bob Dylan\" for example. It's incredibly frustrating.\niTunes also now displays music that I downloaded years ago and have since deleted, and there is no easy way to hide music that is not actually on my computer.\n", "Q: Getting programs/apps back onto computer after employer reimages I'm considering buying my used MacBook Air from my employer.  One of the main reasons for doing so is because it is loaded with tons of awesome software (Adobe, Microsoft, etc.) that I would never be able to afford!  I do realize this is not legal.\nOf course, before selling it to me, they insist on re-imaging the computer (sans all of those awesome programs) to maintain their site license agreements. Good for them.\nIs there any way I can get these programs back onto the Mac after it gets wiped?\n\nA: There is no way that you are going to get those programs. The MacBook will be connected to an enterprise server and as soon as it is wiped, it gets restored to factory state. If you get the authorization code to connect to the enterprise server then you can get all the programs that are available under the license which your company possess.\n\nA: As a general case, you would need a backup that's either a system copy or a Time Machine backup to restore anything (apps, settings, passwords, certificates, user accounts, and such) to a machine.\nDepending on how the company has installed the applications, they might be tied to an App Store model and things that are signed applications won't run without the password or a valid enterprise entitlement/MDM pushing updates to the applications.\nIt would be hard to guess what happens if you tried to restore that backup or if you tried to manually reinstall some things (say you wanted the documents you personally were responsible and allowed to recover).\nIn an ideal world, you would get some IT help to thin the things that need to be removed from the device and get their blessing to make a backup of the things you can realistically restore.\nThen you would need to purchase licenses for the software or seek alternative apps that are priced in a way you wish to spend to make your personal computer get things done you need. Not everyone needs photoshop, for example. Things like Acorn or Pixelmator do a fantastic job at a different price point than Adobe's product.\nLastly, don't overlook how many documents Apple's core notes, Preview, iCloud web apps can edit and annotate quite well.\n", "Q: Add music files from my computer to an iPhone I need to put some music files on somebody's iPhone. \nHow can I do that without erasing the content of his iPhone ?\n\nA: You can only sync media from one iTunes library with the iPhone at the same time.\nThis applies even if you have activated \"Manually manage music and videos\".\nIf you see a message that the device is synced with another library, iTunes can't sync the music without first erasing and replacing all iTunes content on the device.\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201593\n", "Q: Problems with Photos App under El Capitan I have 2 problems.

I have selected the 'MacFUSE compatibility layer' because it is required by veraCrypt (from https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/). \nCopying to/from the Mac to the NTFS HDDs works as expected. However, I can no longer use the Disk Utility's \"First Aid\" utilities (to correct permissions, to correct errors when the HDDs get incorrectly dismounted). The disk utility options are now 'greyed out' for my HDDs. These options are still available for my internal SSD and for my SD card, so the disk utility is not 'broken'. The HDDs are also fine: they work correctly and I can still fix them on Windows. The problem (the only one I can see so far) is that I can no longer fix my external HDDs with the Mac's disk utility.\nI'm currently on OSX Yosemite.

The SAT SMART driver (available at https://github.com/kasbert/OS-X-SAT-SMART-Driver) extends the standard driver behaviour by providing access to drive SMART data. I was successful in changing the SMART status of my HDD to \"Verified.\" But this does not appear to have helped much as the errors reported above still appear.\n\nA: The community NTFS-3G driver in conjunction with Disk Utility doesn't allow you to repair the file system of an NTFS-formatted volume nor its permissions. \nThe file system repair feature is only available in the commercial Tuxera NTFS for Mac edition (based on the NTFS-3G driver) - either by using Disk Utility or Tuxera Disk Manager.\nIn the default configuration the files and folders of the mounted NTFS volume are owned by the effective user and group of the mounting process - the common settings are 777. This means all OS X users have full access to the volume or: Permissions are ignored!\nAt least in Linux using the community driver this can be overridden by modifying the mount options and user mappings (also: Advanced ownership and permissions). I don't know if this also works in OS X. The commercial Tuxera NTFS for Mac doesn't mention anything like this in its manual.\n", "Q: USB Win 7 boot disk shows in rEFInd but booting from it loads BootCamp partition instead I'm having issues with my BootCamp installation of Win 7 Ultimate and want to troubleshoot it using a USB Win 7 boot disk. I created the USB disk in yet another Windows system in Parallels Desktop, using an ISO of my Windows 7 DVD and the USB/DVD Download tool available from Microsoft. When I reboot the computer, the drive shows up in rEFInd, but if I try to boot from it it just loads my problematic Windows installation (with Boot Camp as the C: drive). Any ideas what I should try next?\n\nA: You have not provided enough information to precisely answer your question. Therefore, I will try to cover all the bases. Older Macs can not boot the Windows installer from a USB port. Generally if your Mac was shipped with an optical drive, then your Mac is one of the older models. Another way to tell, would be to try and create the USB installer using the Boot Camp Assistant application. If you can not, then the application knows you have such a model. You may read, elsewhere, that it is possible to edit a info.plist file to fool the Boot Camp Assistant into allowing you to create the USB Windows installer. Just because you can succeed, does not automatically mean your Mac will be able to boot from USB drive.\nAgain, just because rEFInd detects your USB Windows installer, does not mean your Mac can boot from the device. The tool rEFInd is a boot manager, not a boot loader. It can only override the default boot partition or device setting. The Mac firmware still preforms the operation of booting from a particular partition or device.\nI believe the Windows USB installer created, using the  tools provided by Microsoft, produces a installer that will not work on any Mac. I believe this to be true, regardless of the year the Mac was made. Also, for the newer Macs, the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" is suppose to be transferred to the USB drive before installing Windows. The allows the Windows installer the choice of substituting software, such as drivers provided by Apple and other venders, during the installation process.\nAs for where to go next? This depends on the model/year of your Mac and the version of OS X you have installed.\n", "Q: Java 8, Update 73 not installing I'm following the procedure on Oracle's website to install Java 8, update 73.

When I add them, they stay for 30 seconds or so and then disappear. Why is this happening and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I think it's some kind of glitch in your phone or settings are not correct.\nI checked on my iPhone 5, which runs iOS v.9.2.1 and event was saved even 3 years further. It's doesn't depend is it 1 year ahead, or 1 day ahead.\nTry to troubleshoot:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you are in a Calendar App, click calendars button in the bottom, and make sure the proper calendar is selected with checkboxes.\n\n*Check if the settings of synchronization for calendars are correct. Settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendars. \n\n*Try placing event to some other, closer date, closer than one year, if it doesn't work - proceed further.\n\n*Try a Restart. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button for a few seconds until the red \"slide to power off\" slider appears, and then slide the slider. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the Apple logo appears.\n\n*Try system update, check if there are newer versions of iOS Settings->General->Software update.\n\n*Resetting your settings. You can also try resetting all settings. Settings->General->Reset->Reset All Settings. You will have to enter all of your device settings again.\n\n\nA: \"Reset all settings\" finally solved the problem on my iPhone 6.  Note that I chatted and spoke with Apple Support and was ultimately told that the functionality simply wouldn't allow appointments over 1 year out.  Don't believe it.\n", "Q: External hard drive disconnected during reformat: now will not format Using disk utility, I was erasing and re-formatting to FAT. During that process, the usb cable was removed. Now, the hard drive will not format. When recognizing the hard drive, a window shows up stating \"The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer\" with the options to \"initialize; ignore; eject.\" \"Initialize\" does not seem to do anything.\nDisk Utility shows the physical drive, but no sub folder (volume?) When attempting to erase and create a new partition, I get an error.\nThe disk was already empty, so I'm not worried about retrieving files, but is the drive itself physically damaged?\n\n\nA: You could try overwriting the partition table with zeros. To do so, enter sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk3 bs=1m count=1 in a Terminal window. This will overwrite the first megabyte of the drive with zeros, which will include (and thus erase) the partition table (or its remnants). Remove and re-insert the drive; if everything goes well it will tell you that the disk was not readable and it'll offer to initialise the disk. (I tried this with an old USB stick a minute ago and it worked fine.)\n", "Q: Can I backup my new iPhone 6s from my 5s that has an older ios installed? If i use iTunes backup from my old device will it just backup my data and settings? I'm worried it will downgrade my ios. And I want the latest update.. \n\nA: Yes. Restoring from a backup from an iPhone with a previous iOS version installed will work just fine - only data and settings will transfer. Other than using iCloud, using iTunes is Apple's recommended way to transfer data and settings.\niTunes can only install the latest available iOS version (and updates) from the update servers for the type and vintage of device that requests it. This means, for example, that early iOS devices, such as the iPad1, cannot be upgraded past iOS 5.1.1.\n", "Q: Projector only displays one color I have a SharpVision XV-DW100U projector, and I am trying to connect it to my Macbook Air running OS X Yosemite. I connect it to the projector and it displays right for a few seconds, then turns green. It displays fine on other monitors, so I think it may be a projector problem. I confirmed this later by pressing the button labeled RGB/Comp and it turns red. When it's green, it has the letters RGB along with the resolution and projector speed. \nJust to clarify, it shows the image, just not the other colors. All other inputs work correctly except for the VGA input 1 and input 2.\nEdit 2: cable is all right. It works fine with another monitor. Same goes for adaptor. \nEdit 3: projector pins are all right too. \n\nA: Macbook doesn't have VGA built in, so normally everyone is using DisplayPort to VGA Adapter, which is actually converting digital signal to analogue. The issue might be with converter itself, but if you are saying it's bad only with the Projector, but works with everything else fine - then I assume that Adapter is ok.\nI'd suggest you to troubleshoot in order of appearens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adapter.\n\n*VGA Cable.\n\n*Connection slot or pins on the projector input.\n\n\nTo check the adapter is easy - try connecting via different vga cable to any monitor which has it. To check VGA cable you are using - try connecting it to different device, for example other projector or monitor. Clean the pins in VGA slot of projector, it might be some dust got in from ventilation, or whatever.\nThe single color to me sounds like it's bad contact somewhere, a VGA cable is broken, or with pin connectors. This happens normally when you have analog cable, alike VGA, when one/several color components goes off.\nIf you projector has other inputs, DVI or HDMI - I'd recommend to use them, instead of analog VGA.\n\nA: It seems that the pins in the VGA cable or inputs on the projector are having some issues. If the image is turning green then your Red and Blue pins in the cable are either disconnected or have not made proper contact with each other.\nTry replacing your cable, and try getting your VGA inputs on the projector looked at or replaced by a technician.\n", "Q: Which Linux Distro installs on a MacBook (13-inch Early 2008) I have a MacBook (13-inch Early 2008) and need to stick with it for some more time, but Apple doesn't give support anymore to it, so I'd like to install an operating system to keep it alive and kicking with low memory usage.\nWhat is your suggestion for a lightweight and compatible operational system for my old MacBook?\n\nA: How to Test Multiple Linux Distributions\nI recommend making a multi-boot USB stick. I used YUMI to create it, and put a number of Linux distros for testing on new machines. You just pick the one to test at boot time, and then you can run it from the USB memory for a while until you decide if it works well on the target machine.\nBeen a while, but my recollection is that all of the live images were ready to do an install, too. Also can't remember the cost, but I think I paid less than $10 for a large enough memory to hold half a dozen distros, plus state storage.\nRecommendation: Ubuntu\nMy own preference has been Ubuntu these years, though I don't like some of the design decisions they've been making and some versions have been too heavy for my taste. I used one of the Puppy Linux versions for a while, and it was cute and surprisingly robust. Haven't really used Lubuntu that much, but some people recommend it for older and weaker machines.\nProbably not relevant to your Mac situation, but I did find one machine that had a weird problem in booting from the USB stick. It was an old ThinkPad, and even though it said it supported USB booting, it didn't work as expected. The trick was to edit the device list to add the USB stick with the hard disk and then move the USB entry to the top of the list before starting. (Unfortunately, that machine was so old and flaky that no Linux was able to cure its WiFi problems... I found a weird WiFi workaround, but too far out of scope here.)\n\nA: The key to your question was your statement:\n\nWhat is your suggestion for a lightweight and compatible operational\n  system for my old MacBook?\n\nI suggest you take a look at FreeBSD.  BSD is the core of what OS X.  I also had a very good experience installing FreeBSD 10-2 (latest version) on an XServe G4 (PowerPC).  So, your Intel based MacBook should be no problem.\nYou should avoid Linux on a Mac\nNot because it is a bad OS - on the contrary, they are some very good distros out there.  The problem that I have run into is consistency across distributions.\nFor example, if you are doing some web development and you deploy your LAMP stack (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) you will at some point have to modify your Apache config file.  In RedHat it is called httpd.conf and in Mint, it uses apache2.conf.  Keeping things straight as to how one distro does things and how another does things can become very confusing.  This is one of the reasons that when people were opting for Linux, I was hanging on for dear life to Solaris\nSome distros use RPM package management, some use IPS.  apt-get, yum, pkg-install so the way you install MySQL in RedHat will be completely different from the way you install MySQL on Mint, or Ubuntu, or SuSE.\nThat's just one facet...firewall?  IPCHAINS or PF? (OS X now uses PF that was developed on BSD).    \nI am not saying this is a bad thing, it's just if you are not a seasoned user, this is a bag of headaches nobody really talks about.\nAnother problem with Linux and it has nothing to do with Linux itself, is the community.  When I run into an issue and turn to the community for assistance (as everyone does from time to time) you will find it can be both hostile and a place where everyone has an opinion on what distro you are using or should be using.\nWhy you should look at BSD\nI mentioned earlier that BSD is the core of what OS X is.  The biggest difference between Linux and BSD is that Linux is a common open source kernel with open source versions of different components added to create a distro; whereas BSD is a kernel and components developed in tandem specifically to create an operating system.  There's a good presentation that explains this on YouTube; the presenter addresses this within the first 2 mins.\nThe documentation is fantastic. The FreeBSD Handbook is quite literally a text on how to install, administer and maintain your BSD installation.  It is one of the best \"books\" you can get on an BSD and you don't have to spend a cent.  \nThe 27,000+ BSD Ports\nGoing back to your request of getting something lightweight, this is by it's very definition,  BSD.\nOn FreeBSD specifically, when you install it, you get pretty much nothing but the core OS and the SSH server turned on.  You make BSD your own by installing Ports\nWhat are Ports?  They are the \"make files\" and configuration files to the source code of the application you want to install (they have to be downloaded).  \nIs it quicker than installing a package?  No, it will take a bit of time.  But it is specific to your install.  The problem with a preinstalled package is that it depends on what the person who originally compiled it wanted and usually they will include everything so as to be functional across a wide range of installations.  That means \"stuff\" you may never, ever, use.\nWith Ports, you can specify exactly what you want compiled.  You want LDAP?  No problem.  You want Postgres support but no MySQL?  No problem either.  Change your mind later on?  No problem, re-run the Ports installation and recompile.  It's super easy.\nThe benefit here is you get what you want, and nothing more.  \nFor example, I have a development server on an XServe G4 (PowerPC).  I don't run a GUI desktop so that didn't get installed.  But on this G4 processor, which according to Apple should have been either recycled or put into a museum somewhere, I am running :\n\n\n*\n\n*PHP 5.6 \n\n*MySQL 5.5 \n\n*Apache 2.4\n\n*Native iSCSI initiator that allows me to connect to new modern disk arrays like an HP 3PAR (enterprise storage) or something like a Synology Diskstaion (SOHO NAS) and everything bigger and smaller.  OS X El Capitan still cannot do this .\n\n\nAnd we do Drupal 7/8 development on it.  Not bad for a machine that relegated to the trash heap by Apple in 2004.  Here's the phpinfo() page if you want to see the results.\nBSD is strong, lightweight and stable.  If you are looking for something that will work really well on your Mac, then BSD is (IMO) the strongest choice.\n\nA: Have you considered Windows 10. I am currently entering this answer using a mid 2007 iMac with 4 GB of memory running Windows 10 Pro 64 bit.\nI do agree with shanen's answer. I have also once had Ubuntu Linux installed on my Mac. You should be able to create a bootable USB flash drive containing a Live version of Ubuntu. This will allow you to test to see if your hardware is compatible before installing to your internal drive. The Live version boots Ubuntu directly from the flash drive without altering your internal disk. Note, the Live version will be very sluggish. You will experience improved performance once installed directly to your internal drive. BTW, is used Unetbootin to create the Ubuntu USB flash drive.\n", "Q: How do people use Tags in Finder? I've searched online; I have found lots of information around HOW to assign/remove tags, but very little around how people USE them. (that in itself might be the sign that not many people actually use them? :)\nThe best I could find is that some people use them for categorising work; e.g. \"Final\", \"Research\", \"Draft\", etc.\nHowever, although this is a very legitimate way of using them, I feel that still doesn't use tags to their full extent - namely, the ability to have more than one tags attached to the same file. In the example above, a file is either 'draft' or 'final'. You can achieve the same result using nested folders, although that is different visually.\nHow do you use them? Or alternatively, can you suggest a link/site/blog that explains how they use them?\n\nA: I can't say that I love the tagging system, so I have very limited use of them: but I've used tags in two ways:\n1. For final version documents\nSince I often have several versions of the same file on storage, I have one tag named \"final\". So it facilitates spotlight searches like \"quote client tag:final\". This is the only use I've been able to stick to constantly, since I often find myself searching for the final version of a document.\n2. For document types\nSince I use my folder hierarchy to separate different projects, I use tags for document content types. For instance, named tags \"Proposal\", \"Specs\", \"Guide\", etc. This offered the small benefit of allowing shorter file names (intended to avoid names like Proposal_CustomerName_ProjectName.ext. I wasn't able to stick to this tagging style, since longer names seemed still seemed efficient, even if they're not pretty.\nI rarely browse files in finder, mostly I search through spotlight. So the only real benefit I see in tags is being able to type \"tag:abcdf\" in spotlight. With this approach, since everyone organizes in a different way, I guess the key question is: \nIs there a criteria that you often find yourself wishing you could use in searches, and which doesn't really fit in your file naming styles or folder hierarchy?\n", "Q: Why won't my new iMac El Capitan print from Word? I have a new iMac El Capitan (and I'm a new Mac user) attached to the Canon Pixma MX926 printer (about 4 years old) with a USB cable.  I can print from the Apple help menu, but can't print any Word documents. I'm sure I'm doing something very simple wrong, but can't figure out what.  Can anyone help?\n\nA: Welcome to Stack.\nTry reinstalling, or resetting up any drivers for your printer. You can do this using either built-in mac features, or using any drivers provided by Canon on their website (available here).\nFor the built-in Apple feature head over to System Preferences.\nThen navigate to Printers and Scanners.\nClick the - and remove your printer.\nClick the + and add follow the steps to re-add your printer.\nHopefully this fixes your issue!\n", "Q: How to solve the issue of \"This iPad hasn't been backed up in 9 weeks\" preventing all UI on the iPad?

Must I force shut down it by \"Power button\" plus Menu button for 5 seconds?  Or is there another way?\n\nA: If you cannot dismiss the message and or cannot shutdown the iDevice normally by pressing the \"Sleep/Wake\" button for approximately five seconds and then slide the \"Slide to Power Off\" slider, then you have no choice but to do a hard reset.\nHold the \"Sleep/Wake\" and \"Home\" buttons simultaneously for around 10 seconds to reset the iDevice.\n", "Q: Symlink Google Drive I want to sync folders that are on my Mac to Google Drive, without having to drag the folders to the Google Drive folder and preserving my folder structure on my Mac. \nI assumed you would have to have a symbolic link (symlink) for this to work.\nSo I tried in Terminal: \ncd /path/to/google/drive\nln -s /path/to/folder/\n\nThe folder appeared on my Google Drive folder, but it did not want to sync. \nSo I then tried \nln -s “/path/to/folder”  “/path/to/google/drive/”\n\nStill did not work. So I referred to this  HowToGeek article about this topic and it said that you must move the original folder to the Google Drive folder and make a symbolic like to the original parent folder.\nI'd like to have the original not in the Google Drive folder. Is there a free alternative to the symlink? I have looked at jdrivesync but had failed to install (that'll be another problem in another discussion). \nThanks for your help!\n\nA: You can use a directory hard link, but only on HFS+ file system. You'll need GNU ln to use the -d option. This can be installed using Homebrew: brew install coreutils, then run:\nsudo gln -d \"/path/to/original\" \"/path/to/drive/folder\"\n\nYou will be asked for your password. This command creates a hard link to the file/folder itself rather than how a symlink links to a pointer to a file/dir. As the link folder is essentially the same as the original folder, Google Drive syncs it correctly.\nTo unlink a hard link, use unlink \"/path/to/drive/folder\".\nWARNING: APFS (Apple File System) does not support hard links. If you plan on installing macOS High Sierra or later and want to continue using directory hard links, you will need to maintain your HFS+ file system. By default macOS High Sierra intaller on a mac with SSD (e.g. without HDD or Fusion Drive) automatically converts HFS+ filesystem to APFS. To skip conversion during upgrade you will need to run the macOS installer as follows: \n/Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/*/R*/startosinstall --converttoapfs NO\n\nIf you avoid the last option you will end up with mess of hard linked dirs in /.HFS+ Private Directory Data after the the upgrade.\n\nA: Hardlink traditionally only works for file, not directory.\nThough HFS+ supports directory hardlink, it is rather a internal feature reserved for Time Machine. Use it at you own risk.\nYou might look at SugarSync , which claims\n\nBack up and access your files. Using your existing folder structure.\n\nA personal experience with directory hard link is that\n\n\n*\n\n*I shrink-and-then-enlarge the Time Machine disk, which heavily uses directory hard link\n\n*Then the backup data is messed up\n\n*I have to format the partition, losing the history\n\n\nA: Google Drive seems to be useless unless you want to reorganize your disk.\nSugarsync is designed with Windows in mind. It is really spiffy, and it lets you sync existing folders, wherever they are. I used it for a while. It has a Mac client, but that's all the thought they put into it. It can't sync bundles correctly. Bundles are a UNIX structure that the Mac uses for applications and data files. So I got rid of Sugarsync.\nMicrosoft's OneDrive doesn't do symlinks and I don't think they even know what bundles are.\nDropbox on the other hand honors symlinks and handles bundles correctly.\n\nA: Two ways to get lots of files/folders into Google Drive without altering your file structure:\n\n\n*\n\n*With Google Drive for Mac installed: duplicate the relevant folders and drag their copies into the Google Drive folder. \n\n\nOR\n\n\n*Using Google Drive with Google Chrome: drag the relevant folders onto a Google drive window in Chrome; they'll upload and this won't mess up your file structure.\n\n\nUsing either of these methods will get your folders into Drive without altering your file structure. \nI know neither of these are what you requested, but they should both do the job. Comment below for anything else.\n\nA: In macOS Sierra and with new coreutils solution in earlier post don't work as expected. \n1) You are going to need gnu coreutils. You can install it via homebrew.\nbrew install coreutils\n\n2) (optional) you may type gln --help to get manual of usage this command. This will output 4 ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Usage: gln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME   (1st form)\n\n*or:  gln [OPTION]... TARGET                  (2nd form)\n\n*or:  gln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY     (3rd form)\n\n*or:  gln [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY TARGET...  (4th form)\nIn the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.\nIn the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.\nIn the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.\n3) Go to google 'drive folder' (GD) or any GD subfolder via command line:\n3.a) You can in terminal type cd (space after 'd') and drag folder/directory onto terminal window\n3.b) or just type your way to destination like cd /Users/yourAccountName/Google\\ Drive/sub/subSubFolder\n\n where 'yourAccountName' is name of your account in OS and  'sub/subSubFolder' your folder structure in GD.\n Please note that you need to 'escape' special symbols in your file path and name with backslash ('\\'), like I did with space in name of folder 'Google Drive', so it looks now 'Google\\ Drive'.\n4) And, as grgarside clarified in his post, you need to use sudo\nand -d key to perform linking.\nSo, just type:\nsudo gln -d '/Users/yourAccountName/path/to/original/folder/with/your/stuff'\n\n", "Q: What does this black bar represent in my iPod's Storage Capacity Indicator? I was recently going through my (2nd Gen) iPod Touch's storage settings in the most recent version of iTunes and noticed that there is a small gray/black bar next to the \"Other\" storage section. I highly doubt that this is simply a drop shadow as other depictions of this graph do not feature such a bar.\nWhat does this small bar represent?\n\nNote: The small bar is outlined in red.\n\nA: To my belief, that indeed is actually just a drop shadow.

How can I test my LAN speed when I do not have two computers? I have a Mac, an iPhone, and Apple TV.\nI want to see the strength of my home network. I don't care about testing my internet connection, just the LAN.\nWhat tools are available?\n\nA: How to Measure\nThe place to monitor the speeds of course is your Mac. The easy built-in network speeds monitor is in Activity Monitor at the bottom of the main window. Alternatives include MenuMeters or iStat Menus which put the speeds right up in the menu bar.\nHow to test\nThis depends on which version of the Apple TV you have. With version three and earlier (the common black one), there's no local storage so you won't have much luck testing the upper limits. With the Apple TV 4, you'd need to jailbreak it to be able to directly copy media onto the drive (very strange). Just streaming won't test the limits of your network as most streaming will be in easy territory of 500 kb/sec, although you could try streaming an original MP4 from a DSLR to see if that chokes your network (and at what speed watching the transfer rates in either Activity Monitor, MenuMeters or iStat Menus).\nIt's fairly easy to figure out what your speeds will be. Any recent Mac (last six years) has 1000 BaseT (aka gigabit) ethernet (if it has ethernet at all, the USB to Ethernet adapter is just 100 BaseT). Hence the bottleneck will be your router. Real world speeds of 100 BaseT are 4.5 to 6 MB/sec. I recently upgraded my own router from 100 BaseT to 1000 BaseT (my old gigabit router had failed about a year ago) and had my internal transfer speeds jump from 6 MB/sec to 30 MB/sec. On the other hand, my computers on the powerline technology I use in part of the house to cut down on the ethernet cables along walls only tested at 4 MB/sec (even though it's theoretical maximum should have been closer to 40 MB/sec).\nYou won't be able test your wired internal network speeds with your iPhone as the connection is wireless. If you only want to check wireless connection, you can try copying some large files into your Saved Photos folder on your iPhone.\nFor your wired ethernet testing, I'd suggest having a friend bring over a 1000 BaseT laptop to do your wired ethernet testing. His laptop, a second short ethernet cable and some simple file transfers will do the trick. Testing with network storage devices (NAS) is not recommended as most of them are considerably slower than listed (there are exceptions).\n", "Q: Need a cli to check the sha256 hash of a file To check the sha1 of a file I would use openssl sha1 <file> I'm not sure what to use to check the sha256 hash of the file however, what would you recommend?\n\nA: You can use\nopenssl dgst -sha256 <file>\n\nTested on LibreSSL 2.6.4 on macOS 10.14 (Mojave).\n\nPrior to Mojave you can use openssl sha -sha256 <file> or openssl sha256 <file>.\nTo check command line options for the openssl sha command: openssl sha -help.\n\nA: To clarify @John's useful answer - which allows you to compare a given hash with its file in one command:\nEnter shasum -a 256 -c <<<,\nfollowed by an optional space,\nfollowed by a single tick ('),\nfollowed by the hash to compare,\nfollowed by a space,\nfollowed by a mode character, based on how the initial hash was generated:\n\n\n*\n\n*nothing, if the hash was created with -t or no option (text mode, which is the default)\n\n*asterisk (*), if the hash was created with -b (binary mode)\n\n*question mark (?), if the hash was created with -p (portable mode)\n\n*caret (^), if the hash was created with -0 (bits mode)\nfollowed by the path to the file,\nfollowed by a closing single tick (').\nLike the following breakdown, with delineating parens around the hash and filepath parts, and square brackets around the optional \"mode character\" part.

I started my Photos app on the Mac by pressing the Option key and then clicking on the Photos app icon, so that I can choose an external hard drive to store photos.\nHowever, the Photos app is showing \"No Photos\" in the Import tab, when there are about 70GB of photos.  The \"Photos\" tab, however, show a lot of photos, but they cannot be imported into my Mac.\nI am running the latest iOS 9.2.1 and Mac OS X El Capitan.  How do I make this work?\n\nA: I would recommend Image Capture. It's a bit less advanced than the new Photos, but in my opinion it's simpler.\nOpen /Applications/Utilities/Image Capture.app to begin.\nNext, select which directory you would like to import the photos to from the \"Import to\" dropdown.\nCmd ⌘A to select all, and hit the \"import\" button OR hold Cmd ⌘ and click to select a few to import. Either way, the selected images will be imported into the specified directory.\nTo delete all these imported photos from the exporting device (ie iPhone), Cmd ⌘A and click on the \"delete\" button (looks like a prohibition sign).\nSide note: if you wish to rotate an image, click the \"Rotate\" button (looks like an arrow) and all selected images will be rotated.\n", "Q: How to turn off Apple TV?

I do not know if this is the right error message from the log:\nApplication Specific Information:\nSandbox creation failed: Container object initialization failed.\nNSCocoaErrorDomain:512\n\nDoes anyone know how to fix the problem or how to reinstall the application even if it's a system app?\n\nA: As @Redarm suggested, you should remove the folder found at\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX\n\nAfter that, quit and reopen QuickTime.\n\nA: I had a slightly similar fix on Mac Catalina. I searched for \"com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX\" in Finder, right clicked it, clicked \"Show in Enclosing Folder\" and then saw it was in a folder called \"Autosaved Information\".\nIt looks like it was holding on to some sort of corrupted video file that crashed QT, so every time I would open QT it would try to open the video, causing it to crash, and on and on.\nOnce I deleted everything in the Autosaved Information folder it worked again.\n", "Q: Determining source app of IP traffic in NETunnelProviderManager I am using NETunnelProviderManager in \"routing by destination IP\" and am able to get IP traffic from various apps on the device.\nThe challenge I am having is that I need to determine which application each packet has come from so I can filter and block traffic as needed, so I can prevent a rogue app being created to access an internal location. It is not feasible for me to use NETunnelProviderManager's \"per-app\" mode since I am not using MDM.\nIt seems that if I had access to the system's TCB table (or access to the TCB table for each process) I could do this, but it looks like iOS does not publish this information and I haven't found any private APIs either to get this information on a non-jailbroken device.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: It says specifically on the NETunnelProvidermanager specs, \"The only way to configure \"per app\" VPN is with MDM...\" so in terms of the mainstream way of meeting all the Apple specifications, and at least in the context of Apple Stack Exchange, it seems this would not be possible.  I hope someone else, or I, can find a nice workaround for you though if it doesn't work.\nOne tip though:  it does discuss directly below the VPN settings, in the spec guide, how to configure on-demand VPN, and if your requirement is not that that the VPN is \"always on,\" you may be able to meet your specific goal just by creating the necessary certificates.\nYou may prefer to to make the .mobilconfig files by hand once you see the options and syntax available, but you might be able to generate only exactly the certificates you need, for example the VPN, using Apple Configurator without having to completely take control of the device.\n", "Q: iPhone camera app to document wear and tear of items? I'd like to document the wear and tear of everyday items. For that, the photos taken must be taken from similar distances and angles. Is there an app that helps achieving the right angles and distance, for example by overlaying the live camera image (before shooting) with a semitransparent older image or by using markers on the object? Or is there another way to do this with the regular camera app?\n\nA: Look for photography apps that support onion skins. Time lapse photography and stop motion apps are a good example. Frameographer gets very good reviews, but is a bit pricey. Check the web for alternatives!\n", "Q: Better Android File Transfer program I need a way to hook up my android phone to my Mac and generate preview of the files when they reside on the device. \n\n\n*\n\n*The Android File Transfer program lacks view by icon.

(I went with Yosemite instead of El Capitan because, as the computer is destined to become a file server, I wanted native RAID support.)  I started the OS X installation around 5:30 PM last night; at 10:30 PM the computer was stuck on the \"Setting up...\" screen.  I know that OS X installs aren't supposed to take five hours.  Is the fact that I have the OS X install flash drive still inserted in the Mac Pro causing this?  Or is it something else?\n\nA: Rebooting without the OS X flash drive inserted fixed the problem.\n", "Q: Why does OS X delete files directly without moving them into the trash? On an external HD, when I delete a file, OS X prompts me that the file will be deleted without putting it into the trash folder.\nWhat is the reasons for that?\nHow can I move it in trash folder before permanently delete it?\n\nA: The OS X finder maintains a few hidden directories to handle Mac specific filesystem functions like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Spotlight = /Volumes/X/.Spotlight-V100\n\n*file version history = /Volumes/X/.DocumentRevisions-V100\n\n*trash = /Volumes/X/.Trashes\n\n*Time Machine (and other) filesystem changes = /Volumes/X/.fseventsd\nThese are suppressed on many network and \"foreign\" filesystems by design and/or if the filesystem is read-only. You can use the command line tool (or the get information menu command in Disk Utility) to inspect the format of your volume:\ndiskutil list /Volumes/X/\n\nHopefully this is the cause - if your volume is of type Apple_HFS or similar and you don't see the hidden directories, you might need to dig deeper and repair that filesystem or look at some other cause. The simple reason would be that the hidden directories are suppressed by design in your case.\n", "Q: Apple Watch photo backup My teenager went fly fishing this weekend...\nThe iPhone has been destroyed, but photos remain on the Apple watch. Is there a way to upload them directly from the watch to the cloud before I reset and pair with his new phone?   \nNote that there was not a prior backup on iCloud and his watch/phone was not connected to Photo Stram.\n\nA: At present, Apple's WatchOS won't connect to Wi-Fi or iCloud directly. Even if you brought up each image and took a low resolution screen capture - there isn't a viable way to send them off the device in the absence of the phone to which it was paired.\nI would do two things just in case there's a maintenance procedure for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contact AppleCare and ask about watch backups when the phone is gone.\n\n*See if waiting for the phone to dry out over a week or more and/or risk opening it to expedite the drying process.\n\n\nMost devices that get submerged will function for a short time (with greatly reduced lifespan) once they dry completely - and that process could take a week or more before you introduce it to the best chance of working (known Wi-Fi network, connect to power to see if it boots and then connect to iTunes in the presence of the watch and a pre-joined network to try and get a backup of the photos).\nSorry I can't offer a higher chance of success. Going forward, you can make sure photos back up to iCloud and get the phone to network access periodically to reduce the window in time where photos only exist on the phone/watch combination.\n", "Q: Reformat iPhone as USB Is it possible to erase and reformat an iPhone to be act as a USB? I've seen many apps that can store data and then you can access it, but is it possible to actually reformat the entire iPhone to behave as a USB?\n\nA: Not that I know of, no.  However, there is an app called Documents Pro ($5 US, and definitely worth it) that would do something similar to what you want.  The difference is that it connects via WiFi as a network drive as opposed to connecting via USB.\n", "Q: Homebrew won't link git I am trying to enable autocomplete for git on my mac (currently running El Capitan) but I am having troubles with Homebrew.\nSo far, I have installed bash-completion and added the lines in my bash_profile, as seen in this post The problem comes when doing brew install git (although there must be another git installed in my machine sin I have used it). \nAfter reinstalling brew, I get that git is installed but it's not link:\nWarning: git-2.7.3 already installed, it's just not linked\n\nI try using the command brew link git and I get this:\nLinking /usr/local/Cellar/git/2.7.3... \nError: Could not symlink share/git-core/contrib\n/usr/local/share/git-core is not writable.\n\nHave anybody faced this situation before? How can I link git and what's exactly the \"linking\" problem?\n\nA: I used brew doctor to see what's was happening..

And now auto-completion works fine\n", "Q: Best practices for Macbook Pro usage I have a new Macbook Pro and I want it to last and keep a healthy battery.\nHow do I best ensure this? \n\n\n*\n\n*If I am using it, do I let it discharge, or leave it plugged in? \n\n*If I am discharging it / allowing it to be unplugged, should I plug it in again when it reaches a certain %?\n\n*Is there a particular battery level I should wait for before shutting down / recharging?\n\n*When is it okay to close the lid vs. shutting down completely? \nIf it matters, I use my Macbook Pro daily, and I take it to work with me so I can do some coding when I have downtime at work.\n\nA: In general, Lithium-Ion batteries don't like being discharged frequently, and decent computers will cut off the charging circuit once the battery is fully charged.\n\nIf I am using it, do I let it discharge, or leave it plugged in?\n\nLeave it plugged in, if your battery is at 100% the circuit is shut off, and you're essentially not using your battery at all, helping its life expectancy.\n\nIf I am discharging it / allowing it to be unplugged, should I plug it\n  in again when it reaches a certain %?\n\nYou shouldn't be doing it generally. Batteries only need about one full cycle (full discharge-charge) per month to stay healthy.\n\nIs there a particular battery level I should wait for before shutting\n  down / recharging?\n\nAs stated before, it's recommended to stay at 100% and only run one charge cycle about once a month. This charge cycle can be one-time where you fully discharge/charge it, or it can be several partial cycles (for instance 5 cycles where you discharge to 80% and then charge back to 100%)\n\nWhen is it okay to close the lid vs. shutting down completely?\n\nIt depends. As per question 1, if your computer is plugged in it won't be using the battery at all, so no harm there; but if your computer isn't plugged in, it will consume battery charge (though not much). So if you're going to leave your computer unattended for a considerable time, you want to either leave the computer plugged in, or shut it down, or take advantage of the charge usage as part of your \"monthly charge cycle\". I'd say its ok to put it in sleep mode unplugged only for short periods of time, such as driving to work/home, but it might even be ok to do so for the night, to force your monthly charge cycle.\nBottom line: battery life expectancy is measured in cycles, so the worst you can do is to constantly discharge and recharge it. Leaving it plugged in helps your battery life by not using it at all.\n", "Q: Does Fantastical support viewing free/busy information from Google Calendar? Or said another way, can I see availability of invitees (and resources would be even better) when creating a new event in Fantastical.

As above, they focus on Exchange support, but Google Calendar is mentioned too.\n\n... new in version 2.2 is our spiffy invitee availability view. When\n  using a compatible service — such as Google or Exchange — you’ll be\n  able to see your invitees’ availability and let Fantastical instantly\n  schedule a meeting for when you’re all free, saving you the time of\n  coordinating with multiple people.

On linux I can do something like:\navconv -f alsa -i pulse -f x11grab -r 25 -s 1400x1050 \\\n  -i :0.0+0,0 -vcodec libx264 -threads 4 \\\n  -acodec libmp3lame video.mkv\n\nbut of course the alsa and x11 driver should be different on OS X. How would this work to do command-line video screen-capture?\n\nA: I found a solution that works really well. You're able to record with ffmpeg using an input device called avfoundation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Details\n\n*More options\n\n*ffmpeg options\nHere is an example command-line:\nffmpeg -f avfoundation -pix_fmt yuyv422 -i \"1:1\" -t 10 -vf crop=1280:720:1:65 -r 30 output.mkv\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You may or may not get asked to specify -pix_fmt when this option is not included; it might be worth trying other formats to see if you get better performance.\n\n*As explained in the details link, -i selects both video and audio input. If you want to capture audio playing on your computer, you'll need something like iShowU Audio Capture. \nTo get that to work, you'll need to press Option + F11, select iShowU Audio Capture as an input device and as an output device. You'll notice that once you select it as an output device that you can no longer hear the audio yourself through your speakers or headphones.\nA quick fix is opening Audio MIDI Setup, create a Multi-Output Device and adding iShowU Audio Capture and your normal output device. Select this new Multi-Output device in your sound outputs and there ya go, you can now hear the audio and have it captured.\nUnfortunately you aren't able to control the audio levels now...if someone knows a solution to this please let me know.\n\n*-t is the time in seconds to record.\n\n*-vf is very useful for cropping and offsetting. The current setting is cropped to 1280 width 720 height, offsetting 1 pixel to the left and 65 pixels from the top. You'll need to use a third party tool to get exact pixel measurements of your screen.\n\n*-r is framerate.\n\nA: Note: This answer doesn’t use libav but this question comes up first when searching for “mac screen record command line” in Google.\n\nAs of macOS Catalina, you can now record screen from your command line using the screencapture tool with -v flag.\nSee the help page (screencapture --help) for a description of all options. The options listed in the man page may be incorrect.\nMeanwhile, here are some examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Record your main screen until you hit Ctrl+C in Terminal.

(The man page stay -A but it did not work.)\nscreencapture -v -g out.mov\n\nSome general notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the file already exists, recording will fail after the screen recording is completed. Please beware.\n\n*There is a little bit of delay after recording has started before it actually records your screen.\n\n*-i (interactive mode) does not work with -v.\n\n*-iU (interactive toolbar mode) works with -v, but it will not use the filename specified on the command line.\n\nA: For taking screenshots (not movies) there is screencapture:\npse@Mithos:~$ screencapture -h\nscreencapture: illegal option -- h\nusage: screencapture [-icMPmwsWxSCUtoa] [files]\n  -c         force screen capture to go to the clipboard\n  -C         capture the cursor as well as the screen. only in non-interactive modes\n  -d         display errors to the user graphically\n  -i         capture screen interactively, by selection or window\n               control key - causes screen shot to go to clipboard\n               space key   - toggle between mouse selection and\n                             window selection modes\n               escape key  - cancels interactive screen shot\n  -m         only capture the main monitor, undefined if -i is set\n  -M         screen capture output will go to a new Mail message\n  -o         in window capture mode, do not capture the shadow of the window\n  -P         screen capture output will open in Preview\n  -s         only allow mouse selection mode\n  -S         in window capture mode, capture the screen not the window\n  -t<format> image format to create, default is png (other options include pdf, jpg, tiff and other formats)\n  -T<seconds> Take the picture after a delay of <seconds>, default is 5\n  -w         only allow window selection mode\n  -W         start interaction in window selection mode\n  -x         do not play sounds\n  -a         do not include windows attached to selected windows\n  -r         do not add dpi meta data to image\n  -l<windowid> capture this windowsid\n  -R<x,y,w,h> capture screen rect\n  -B<bundleid> screen capture output will open in app with bundleidBS\n  files   where to save the screen capture, 1 file per screen\n\nFor capturing video, the easiest way is to use the Screen Capture option in Quicktime Player.

It could be that Apple has decided that this app is a bad app. That would explain why it's not available in the App Store anymore and why it won't start anymore: Apple can do that (I think it has to do with the certificate of the developer).\nAnother possibility would be that you upgraded to a newer version of iOS and that the app is not compatible with the newer version. And for some reason, the developer is no longer supporting the app.\nEither way, I don't think it is possible to retrieve your songs. Please don't shoot the messenger.\n", "Q: iOS: How to set language of app independent of iphone/ipad language More & more apps try setting their language automatically, based upon the language of your iPad, then the list of chosen languages.\nUnfortunately, as do a lot of people, my preferred iOS/OSX system language is English, but certain apps (notably the new TomTom Go Mobile) need Dutch to be much of use (at least in Flanders, Belgium).\nAt the same time, the new WW (Weight Watchers mobile app) has poorly implemented localisation as well. Result: when my iPhone is in English, it loads the French version (go figure) even if french is only the third preferred language (behind english & dutch)\nThese apps should receive a warning in the app store, get banned altogether until their localisation performs as advertised, or its settings should get set from the settings menu, imho.\nIs there a way to set the language independent from the main iOS language?\nThis problem pops up regularly (notably in bi-lingual countries or international, cosmopolitan people whose preferences and language capacities vary greatly).\nIf anyone at Apple is reading this; please help!\n\nA: Starting with iOS 13, there is now a way to set an individual language for each app. In the Apple Settings app, open the settings of the specific app, and select the language under \"Preferred Language\". You can select from the languages that the app supports.\n\nA: The way iOS works is that when an app is launched, the operating system tries to match up your preferred device language(s), in order, with the language(s) supported by the app.\nAs an example, suppose you have your device language preferences set to French, then English, and that the app supports French and Dutch, with Dutch as its \"default\" language.\nWhen your device is set to French then the app will display text in French because it has a French localization.\nNext you switch the device language to English. The app doesn't have an English localization so iOS uses Dutch as the app's display language. (It would also do the same thing for any other non-French and non-Dutch language.)\nThere is nothing that Apple can do to \"fix\" this since both iOS and the app are working as expected. Perhaps the app \"should\" be available in a particular language. If you think so then you should be having a conversation with the developer, not Apple.\n\nA: I moved from France to UK, I changed all my phone settings to UK region following Apple guidelines (https://support.apple.com/en-gb/ht201389) but my WW app was still showing in French! I figured out my problem though, maybe it will help you (iOS)\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings\n\n*General \n\n*Langauge & Region \n\n*Region Formats - Region.\n\n\nI then changed the region from France to the UK. Good luck! \n\nA: If you change your region as well as your language and then download the app then all be well.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will work, but it might be worth a try...:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the App from your phone\n\n*Change iOS Language to \"Dutch\" in settings\n\n*Reboot iPhone\n\n*Open App Store, and download the App\n\n*Open app and confirm it's Dutch\n\n*Change iOS language back to English\n\n", "Q: Is this app doing nasty things if an unrelated calendar certificate won't verify? I recently downloaded and used Stamp to import my Spotify playlists into Apple Music.  The app instructs me to favorite an iTunes track and press \"OK\", in order to give the app access to an iTunes cookie.  During this process, a notification popped up saying osascript wanted my password, which I then gave it.  Soon afterward, my calendar was unable to verify the certificate of one of its accounts, making me wonder if my Mac had been compromised.  \nCan I verify whether this app has compromised my Mac?\n\nA: At first glance, the app seems well enough reputable that it's not malicious, but I would send a support request to the vendor to ask how the password was stored/transmitted and if your version of the app is the latest.\nAlso, you don't explain which specific password was asked for? Perhaps you could edit the post to show that dialog (is it the normal asking for admin permissions - if so, that's an OS request and your password is safe on the Mac and the Mac is only as safe as the changes that were made on your behalf). If you went and changed that password, in almost all cases, you're closed the chance that you are vulnerable going forward assuming they don't harvest email and try that password on other accounts they have the potential to identify.\nYou could also use the Keychain Access -> Certificate Assistant to verify several certificates you know to be good so that you are comfortable that your keychain is intact. Having something show bad (false positive) is far less worrying than having a bad cert show good. Lots of things can have the former happen and that doesn't really put much at risk when communications are stopped due to a security check.\n", "Q: Can Internet sharing be configured to be a bridge/switch rather than a separate NAT/router? I'd like to use my wired-ethernet desktop mac as a wifi bridge so that everything that connects to it over wi-fi can see and be seen by everything else on the LAN.\nThere's clearly no way to do this in the GUI, but I was wondering if there is some way to do it in Terminal.\nI'm looking for a solution for El Capitan, but if you have a solution for some other version, that would be acceptable, too.\n\nA: I saw this link, but instructions are outdated and does not work on El Capitan\nhttp://www.notadiscussion.com/2014/01/how-to-make-real-network-bridge-with.html\nTrying to find a solution myself for El Capitan\n", "Q: Watch WWDC videos on Apple TV (4th gen) On the 4th generation of Apple TV, is there a way to watch the presentations delivered at the annual Apple World Wide Developer Conference?\nThe videos can be viewed on a Mac and on iOS devices. But for some geeks like me, lounging on the couch while watching WWDC vids on the big screen would be considered fun.\n\nA: If you have a paid developer account for AppleTV you can download, compile and install WWDC-tvOS. You can also download the OSX version (via the same link) and use Airplay to show the videos on your AppleTV.\n", "Q: Reset \"New Terminal at Folder\" placement in context menu Before when I enabled the option to open a new Terminal window from a certain folder, my context menu looked like this:\n\nNow it looks like this:\n\nHow can I go back to having just the one option in the context menu?  I have tried disabling and reenabling the functionality in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services to no avail.  This appears to have happened after installing SourceTree and I looked around for some options in SourceTree preferences but found nothing so far.  What can I do?\n\nA: This is the Services Menu. I assume if you only have a single Service OS X displays this directly.\nI find it hard to imagine a computer with only a single Service.\nThe only option would be to go to the Services Menu in Finder and disable the other services. Of course if you install any software you may get more Services added.\n", "Q: How to automatically deliver /var/mail/USER to my Gmail? My cron jobs sometimes sends mail to /var/mail/USERNAME.  I normally read it by log on the Mac computer and run mail command to read and delete these mails.  But how to deliver/forward such mails to my Gmail automatically? I would like to  read such mails from different Mac computers in one Gmail account.\n\nA: On my High Sierra (10.13.4) machine, mail honors the .forward file. Create a file in your home directory called \".forward\" containing an email address. All your mail on the Mac system will be forwarded to this address.\nIt makes good sense to limit access to this file, with chmod.\nFor example (open Terminal in your home directory):\ncube:~ borg$ cat > .forward\nlocutus@borg.org <return>\n<ctrl-d>\ncube:~ borg$ chmod 600 .forward\n\nThen you can test by sending a mail to yourself, from the command line:\ncube:~ borg$ mail borg\nSubject: test\nThis is a test.\n<ctrl-d>EOT\ncube:~ borg$ mail\nNo mail for borg\ncube:~ borg$ \n\nNote: this only works for forwarding MacOS system mail, not for forwarding from any of your cloud mail services. You can enter any valid e-mail address in the file.\n\nA: To manage mail routing on *nix system you should configure your MTA.\nHere is extensive manual about MTA capabilities in OSX systems\n", "Q: What is difference \"defaults read\" and \"defaults export\"?

 \n*\n  \n*What is difference defaults read and defaults export?\n  \n*What is the best choice to edit my sidebar?\n  \n\n\nA: The output from defaults read is sent to standard output in human readable format.\nThe output from defaults export is put in the file that you specify in the command in binary format.\nThe problem with your defaults export example: \n\n\n*\n\n*you redirected the standard output to the file: ~/Desktop/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist (using >) and defaults export doesn't send anything to standard output; the result was a file that had nothing in it.\n\n*defaults export requires that you specify an output file in the command. Including the redirection operator (>) before the filename redirected standard output to that file and effectively removed the filename from the command (since redirection of input or output effectively happens prior to command parsing) Thus no output file was specified which resulted in the error message saying that you need \"a path to write to\".\n\n\nDepending on what changes you are making:\n\n\n*\n\n*if possible, use the Finder's Preferences… to change things.\n\n*if Preferences… can't accomplish what you need then it's probably easiest to use defaults read to produce output in a form that you can easily edit and then use defaults write 'plist' (see man documentation) to \"install\" your changes.\n\n*there are other ways to do what you want of varying degrees of difficulty.\n\n\nI'll just mention that the documentation for the defaults command states:\n\nDefaults can be structured in very complex ways, making it difficult\n  for the user to enter them with this command.\n\n", "Q: Unable to update after iTunes ID has been changed Til last week I was using abcd@gmail.com as my iTunes account. Now I have changed my account to abcd@yahoo.com .  \nI have few pending updates on my App Store.\nWhen I am trying to update it, I am asked to login into abcd@gmail.com iTunes. How do I sync all the existing apps with the yahoo id ?\n\nA: Apps, books, tunes & even the iOS itself belong to the ID that purchased them.  \nWhen you say you have 'changed your account' I'm guessing that rather than simply changing the primary email address on your old ID, you've set up a brand new one.\nThis will now leave you in the position that each time you need to update the OS or any app, you will need to sign in with the old ID again.\nIt is not possible to transfer any apps, books or tunes from one account to another so unless you completely erase the device & start afresh with the new ID, repurchasing previous software, then you are stuck with this double sign-in.\nThe additional problem with having set up a new Apple ID with your new email address is that you can now no longer change your primary address on your old ID to that address.\nThis is the method to change a primary email address - for future reference.\nYou may be able to call Apple & see if anything can be done now, but I'm not sure it can.\nChange your Apple ID\nFollow these steps to change the email address that you use as your Apple ID.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign out of iCloud, the iTunes & App store, FaceTime, Find My Friends, Find My iPhone, and iMessage on each device that uses your Apple ID.\n\n*Sign in to your Apple ID account page.\n\n*In the Account section, click Edit > Change Email Address.\n\n*Enter the email address you want to use as your Apple ID.

When I try to do this, it will not allow me to proceed without credit card details, just to download free updates (!). OK, fine i will probably buy the odd App or two, but it will not accept my card details because I have a UK bank card with a Spanish billing address.

Recently I installed LogMeIn app, and installation was done properly. There was no icon of app was made. I am searching but I am not getting the file or app related information in the system file. I am not sure whether it is Hidden or not. Or it got uninstalled automatically. Now, What I want is, how can I search my entire Macbook which looks into all files either hidden or not hidden, and tells me whether there is any file related to that app or not with complete surety.\nNote: I did search about this app on internet and people are saying that it is hard to locate the files of this app and it is hard to delete and does not show up in normal search, even I tried their methods but it is not helping. So first I want to make sure that whether that app is there or not.     \n\nA: First off, if you just google the words uninstall logmein mac, you will find the vendor's Help entry on where to find and delete the relevant files... \nIn general, it's rather difficult to track every file installed by one application installer (that is if the application files are not consequently self-contained within the .app file).\nA) The Finder's Spotlight search has an option to search files by their date of addition, but the Spotlight search doesn't include Library and System folders. A better search application I would recommend instead would be Easy Find (freeware by Devon Technologies). It has extensive search options and will walk through the whole system, and includes hidden files/folders. \nB) If the application installer came as a standard installer package, a '.pkg file', you can often use the package tool Pacifist (shareware by CharlesSoft) to open it and list the contained files with their target folder locations (in Unix: directories) on the machine. Then you go to these folders in Finder (or the Terminal) and delete files/folders 'manually'. \n\n(Hey I'm not affiliated with any of the companies and don't get money for mentioning them or something. These apps are just tried-and-true classics on the Mac.)\n\nA: What you ask isn't generally feasible.\nInstalling an application can do many things in addition to making a new file on the filesystem in many locations.\n\n\n*\n\n*installers and first run of apps can run scripts to make arbitrary and wide-ranging changes\n\n*installers and apps can modify configuration files that existed and change settings\n\n\nIt's really up to the app developer to follow convention and/or provide a document of what is changed and/or provide an installer that takes into account all the things the application changes.\nIf you want to be disciplined, you could always run a time machine (or other backup) before installing any app. By quitting all other apps, you will minimize the false-positive changes to the filesystem. Then immediately post installation, run tmutil compare or another backup and run a script to list all the changed files.\n\nA: The quick way to find all the files is John Chang's Find File. It simply makes available the old whole volume search by name from before Spotlight. Find File is faster than DevonThink's clunky version EasyFind (which I used before).\n\nOnce you are done deleting all the files associated with the application, you should go through all the Launch scripts to make sure that your uninstalled application isn't trying to raise the dead (you'll get a lot of console errors if it is). Lingon will help with finding those.\n\nThere's an older free open source version of Lingon as well as a new paid one ($10). Go through My Agents, Users Agents, Users Daemons looking for mentions of LogMeIn. When you find them, disable or delete the plist. You can also look for them by hand.\n~/Library/LaunchAgents\n/Library/LaunchAgents\n/Library/LaunchDaemons\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to move an opened file to trash? It's possible to move files to trash via Finder with ⌘⌫. But if i have an opened file (e.g. pdf or txt), is there any way to directly move it to trash without first closing it and finding it in Finder? Any shortcut?\n\nA: The shortest way: Right-click the file icon in the title bar of the document window. It will display a drop-down menu of the file's location path. When you choose the folder icon that is directly under the file icon, a Finder window will open with the file already selected (highlighted), and you can directly press ⌘⌫ to trash it.\n\nA: It depends on the app, which has to implement this, not a general OS X keystroke.\nIn Preview: ⌘⌫\nTextEdit seems to have nothing.\n", "Q: Is the hard disk of a late 2015 27\" iMac 5k still replaceable? I'm getting different information from the web vs. Gravis. I'd like to know if the HDD of a late 2015 iMac 27\" model can still be replaced.\nAccording to Gravis it's soldered.\nMy idea was to get a cheap HDD based model and replace the HDD with a fast/large SSD, like I did in my 2012 model.\n\nA: Yes - Apple provides an internal SATA drive with standard connectors but custom firmware.\nAccording to iFixit if you take the screen off carefully you can replace it, you may have to buy a bracket to secure it SSD that don't match the existing 2.5 inch drive mounting screws. \nLooking at the steps it doesn't seem to be to complicated to do but with the 5k iMac you need to be extremely careful since you have to remove the speakers. \nI would paste in the step by step images however there a load of them and you would be better off going to the site and taking a look at the images.\nAlso make sure you have the right screw drivers since its a t20 screw you would need a T20 * 100m screw driver.\n\nA: The late 2015 iMac with fusion drive has a standard 3.5\" mechanical hard drive with custom firmware by Apple (which causes the fan issues others have noted) and a separate 128gb PCI-e ssd which provides the 'fusion' part, it is not a typical hybrid hdd with an internal ssd partition. The hdd is replaceable but unless you are replacing it with an Apple service part you will need a special cable/adapter with an inline temperature sensor so the fans don't run constantly. OWC has all the parts you would need to swap your internal mechanical drive for an ssd and very comprehensive instructions with videos. Be aware that if the drive is swapped out this may 'break' the fusion feature and you may have to do a bit of low-level work in disk utility to restore it.\n", "Q: Ho can I put my custom made emoji designs into keyboard on phone? I have created custom emoji's and need to set them us as keyboard in my iPhone.\nWhat should I save the files as \nand \nhow do I export them to a keyboard and upload it to my phone?\n\nA: To have your custom emoji's appear on your phone, you will need to create a custom font that includes them, and install that font on your phone.  But since these emoji's are not part of the Unicode standard, nobody else will ever be able to see them (unless they also install your font), and you will not find them on any normal keyboard.  To input them and see them on your own phone you would have to also create a custom keyboard which accesses the codepoints of the custom font where they are placed.\nPerhaps a better approach would be to create graphics which you could place in emails or messages.\n", "Q: Developer account under 18 I'm 16 and I've learned to develop iOS apps recently.\nI've finished my first app yesterday and I want to upload it to the App Store.\nI've tried to register with my name and my father's credit card and I got the verification code from Apple. But when I'm trying to sign in to my account I get this error message:\n\nWe are unable to activate your Apple Developer Program membership.\n  We have received your purchase information and will email you shortly to verify additional details.\n\nAdditionally, I'm trying to reach Apple Developer Support for over an hour but they don't answer the phone.\nAny idea what can I do with that?\n\nA: You need to wait for the activation email — there's nothing else you can do and trying to contact anyone else until then may cause confusion. You used a different name than the name on the card used to purchase the membership, so you will need to complete another activation step. This seems to be manually initiated and you need to wait for the email, which may take up to two weeks.\nYou will be given further instructions which may include information on cancelling the membership and being instructed to pay using a card with your own name, which was the final resolution in my case.\n", "Q: How to recover from deleting Xcode CoreSimulator devices from disk?

Change \"C2\" to whichever cell will be your Correct Row and \"C4\" to whichever cell will be your Correct Column.\n\n*Use the INDEX() function to get the value of the cell and put it into another cell, using the coordinates the Applescript calculated for you.\n\n", "Q: Can I tell if a track is in stereo? In iTunes v.12.3.2.35, can I tell if an aiff song is in stereo or mono? I tried \"Get Info\" but I cannot find a tab regarding this. Thank you for any suggestions.\n\nA: It looks like the \"File\" tab of the track info window has what you're looking for.\n\n\nA: In a Terminal run the following command:\nmdls -name kMDItemAudioChannelCount $name.aiff\n\nExample:\nmdls -name kMDItemAudioChannelCount /System/Library/Sounds/Basso.aiff\nkMDItemAudioChannelCount = 2\n\nIf it shows 2, it's stereo.\nNote that this assumes the file resides on a volume that is indexed by Spotlight.\n\nA: Thanks for your input. I have concluded that I will not be able to use iTunes to determine if a track in my library has true stereo sound (as opposed to dual mono sound). Sorry to get away from my original question, but I did find a trial version of a utility that uses a custom-built algorithm to analyze audio files and determine their stereo content to test the CD \"The Kinks Greatest Hits\" (Catalog #R2 70086) on Precision Records & Tapes, Ltd./Rhino Records which according to the packaging consists of digitally remastered mono recordings except for one track. I used the utility to analyze several of the “mono” tracks and I was surprised to find that it determined the tracks were actually stereo files and the waveform indeed showed the stereo content overlaid on the audio waveform. I emailed the company and a representative told me that if their utility determines a file is stereo, it is in fact stereo. He said: \"...it is possible there is some reverb or other effect that is causing the file to be stereo and that if these audio files that I think are mono were imported from a CD, especially a commercially bought CD, the chances of them being mono is almost 0; they are almost definitely stereo.\" I can only see this being the result of the Duophonic sound process by which a monaural recording is reprocessed into a kind of \"fake stereo\". I see that historically this process has caused confusion and disappointment for music buyers even up to the present.\n", "Q: How can I delete a (null) app in usage?

I used a free trial of Parallels Desktop 11 on my 2009 MacBook and the trial expired before I deleted my files from Windows.

But if the buyer installs Parallels Desktop will they get \"my\" Parallels Desktop (with all my files) because it's a virtual drive unaffected by system restore? If so, how can I erase my files from Parallels Desktop as well?\n\nA: A \"virtual\" drive that Parallels creates when you make a Windows virtual machine is like any other file in your Macbook. Once you restore to factory settings (reformat) your old files (and the Windows virtual drive) are no longer accessible (not easily at least, unless they purposely try to recover your files using special tools).

I'd like to give a presentation to other people who happen to be in the same room. I'll be running various programs and would like my screen to be visible as I work. Instead of a projector, I am wondering if I can use screen sharing. It's not clear to me if there is a way I can start such that I can be absolutely sure there is no chance of others having any control over my computer, cursor, command-line, etc. I only want to broadcast my screen to other computers' screens instead of using a big monitor or projector.\nHow exactly can I set up screen sharing to be sure? Are there good alternatives within OSX? (I don't want to have to download or install 3rd party software).\n\nA: There is nothing built into OS X that allows you to share your screen with multiple people at once.\nOne-to-One : Screen Sharing\nOS X's built-in Screen Sharing is limited to a one-to-one connection. Screen Sharing is based on VNC and can be limited to observation only.\nOne-to-Many : Google Hangout / Skype\nConsider using a Google Hangout to share your screen. While it does require third party software, the use of the Chrome browser is free. This approach also ensures no-one can control your shared screen.\nAlternatively, Skype group calls allow for multiple people to observe your screen.\n\nA: We use Skype screen sharing for group training sessions. The image quality of course is nothing like what sharing over a local connection would offer. But the viewer has no chance to touch your screen or affect your computer.\n\nTeamViewer has similar features, much better image quality and has a free edition but the free version is non-commercial use only. Commercial licenses are prohibitively expensive except in a corporate environment (a single portable seat is about $1000).\n\nA portable projector is looking like excellent value in comparison. A good quality full HD BenQ which you could also use to watch movies at home can be had for about $500. It would be great if Apple would enable screen broadcast in a future OS update. It seems like an obvious add. Perhaps there are DRM reasons they don't (rebroadcast of DRM content).\nIf motion isn't that important but image quality is you could also consider setting up automated uploads from a folder of screenshots to something like a Dropbox gallery. From there you could ask people to open the latest screenshot.\n", "Q: El-capitan crashing while booting Objective:\n\n\n*\n\n*Somehow I want to fix the issue and should be able to login to the El-Capitan without reformating as so many valuable files are there\n\n*Find what has caused this problem so that I can avoid this problem in future\nOverview:\nI have two drives on my mac desktop one is Macintosh HD and the other one is El-Capitan and El-Capitan is my start up disk.\nIt was working nicely for long time, then all of a sudden one day El-capitan started showing trouble logging into the account.\nsome applications disappeared from applications like chrome\nI couldn't open any apps it always showing the color wheel\nthen all of a sudden whenever i try to boot up in the el-capitan system started crashing now I am unable to log in to the el-capitan drive.\nBut I am able to login to Macintosh HD which runs on Yosemite\nThe below pictures will depict all the ways I have tried to solve the problem but nothing fixed it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-in/HT203176\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201262\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*They say DiskWarrior can fix this but that is not free\n\n*Take the backup of files and reformat the drive again which I don't want to do unless there is no other way \nNote:\nI didn't any backup mechanism like using TimeMachine\nI would like to leave no stone unturned\nThanks for any help in advance\nUpdate:\nHere is S.M.A.R.T status\n\n\nA: I/O Error usually means your disk has hardware failure. I would backup everything ASAP and change the disk. Disk Warrior will probably not solve the issue as it's only repairing a corrupted filesystem.\nIf you can mount it at some point (try repeatedly), use Carbon Copy Cloner to backup your important data on a new drive. If you can't, try some recovery software like Data Rescue.\n\nA: Your drive is in the process of failing and will soon become unusable.  Drives fail for a number of reasons and all modern drives will try and protect your data by moving what it can from bad sectors to good ones then mark those sectors bad so nothing gets written to them.  \nHowever, if the data is corrupted to begin with, moving it only means you are moving corrupted data.  Your drive is going to continue to degrade and no amount of formatting or \"stress testing\" or using apps like Disk Warrior is going to change that fact. \nDisk Warrior can attempt to save your data, but it cannot stop a drive from physically failing.\nThe good news is that you have a bootable partition in your Mac with Yosemite on it.\nSave your data (Priority 1)\nWhat you need to do, if Time Machine isn't available, is boot into Yosemite, then go to the El Capitan Drive and copy over everything from /Users/<your user name> to an external USB drive or to a USB Flash drive.  (USB flash drives are super cheap - don't risk your data by getting no-name brand or buying from ebay.  Buy these from reputable companies like Amazon so you avoid the counterfeit stuff).\nGet a replacement drive\nThere are no ways around this, but you are going to have to buy a new drive.  This is a good opportunity to get an SSD and increase your performance.  I have used Samsung EVO in the past with fantastic results (using one right now). \nReplace the drive\nYou didn't mention which Mac you had whether it was a Macbook Pro or an iMac or a Mac Mini.  So, I can't give you specific advice, but suffice to say, replacing a drive is quite easy and http://ifixit.com has some fantastic guides to walk you through.  \nDo a clean install of OS X\nIf you have a Mac that was made after 2012, then you have the Internet Recovery Option which will allow you to boot off an image downloaded from the Internet and install a clean copy of El Capitan.  Just hold down CommandOptionR to boot into Internet Recovery Mode.  It may take a while depending on your internet speed, but you will eventually see the familiar OS X installation screens.\nThe other option is to download the El Capitan Installer. This will require you to download and create a bootable USB (or DVD since you have a SuperDrive).  While you have Yosemite running, download El Capitan Installer and create your bootable media.\nIf you are using your USB (8GB or larger), you just execute this command from Terminal:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/<Your Volume Here> --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app --nointeraction\nOf course, replace <Your Volume Here> with the name of  the volume of your USB stick.\nOnce that's created, you can safely power down everything, replace the drive and reinstall.\nRestore Your Data\nOnce you have everything back up and running, just copy of the files you backed up to your Users Directory and you should be good to go.\nSetup a Time Machine\nYou know that external drive I mentioned earlier?  Now's a good time to set up a Time Machine backup to protect your data.  It's not a question of \"if your drive will fail again\" it s a question of \"when.\"\n\nA: Some disk errors are just plain irrecoverable, no matter which utility you use. I would also be wary of using this disk in the future. To give it a good stress test, reformat it while writing zeros. This will force the drive to write to every sector. A stringent, multi-pass write routine will make the disk mechanism really work itself, and if there is a mechanical problem, it may become evident during the format. Although El Capitan's Disk Utility app has removed this function, it can be done using the terminal command diskutil secureErase 4 /dev/dsk1 where dsk1 is the volume designation. In this example, the 4 value is the most rigorous.\n\n\n*\n\n*0 - Single-pass zero-fill erase.\n\n*1 - Single-pass random-fill erase.\n\n*2 - US DoD 7-pass secure erase.\n\n*3 - Gutmann algorithm 35-pass secure erase.\n\n*4 - US DoE algorithm 3-pass secure erase.\n\n\nPrevious versions of Disk Utility, Yosemite on down, have this function.\n\nA: Your hard drive is physically failing. That means both partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*The absolute first thing you need to do if you want to have any chance of recovering even some of your data is power it off immediately.\n\n*Get a new hard drive (better, an SSD) and install it. Install Mac OS X via Internet Recovery.\n\n*Put your old drive in an external enclosure.\n\n*Your best shot is then to use Data Rescue 4. There is a free version which will at least let you know how bad the damage is, and even allows you to recover a few gigs for free. But you'll have to pony up the cash if you want to recover everything. Up to you if its worth it or not.\nDiskWarrior is a great product (and its been around forever), but it is for fixing file[system] corruption and is absolutely of no use with physical hard drive failure. It could even make things worse.\n", "Q: Data usage in MacBook Pro Can someone tell me what is wrong with my MacBook Pro?\nMy normal data usage for 1 day is shown on the image below:\n\nBut in the past few days and for just 1 hour (I have no idea why) my data usage spikes up and its totally unbelievable.\n\nMy usage is just the same as before, nothing change,\nand also lately I have been using 3G speed because of some network problem\nso I wonder why the usage had been GB when it should just be in MB?\nCan someone explain why this happened and also advise on how to fix this?\n\nA: If you leave Activity Monitor open, you ought to be able to sort by Sent or Received Byes to catch the culprit...\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to make folders open in a new window by default in OS X El Capitan?

Is it safe to charge my macbook after the green light shows? Would it not overcharge the battery, or reduce its lifespan?\nI've heard that doing this is completely safe and it increases the cycles or something. Is that correct?\n\nA: Is it safe to leave in?  Yes.  To understand this better we need to know what is happening when you have your charger plugged in.\nWhat do the LED's on the MagSafe Charger Mean?\nAmber:  Battery is charging.\nGreen:  Battery is fully fully charged and no power is being sent to the battery.\nYour battery will naturally dissipate it's charge without use and the charger will detect this drop and automatically begin its recharge cycle.\nIs it safe?\nI am assuming you are referring to the longevity of the battery and not whether you will incur some sort of injury.\nWhat affects the life of a battery are two things:\n\n*\n\n*Number of Cycles - how many times the battery has been discharged and recharged.  1 cycle is a 100% discharge and recharge, or 5 20% discharges and recharges or 100 1% discharges and recharges.\n\n*Age -  this is actually the number one reason for batteries to fail.  Basically, a 3 year old battery that has never been used is going to perform about as well as a 3 year old battery that is used every day.\n\nI answered a similar question recently about What's the best way to prolong the lifespan of a MacBook Pro battery?\nCatalina Battery Health Management Feature\nAs of Catalina (10.15.5), there is a new feature; it's called Battery Health Management.  It will actually stop charging your battery and lower the maximum charge amount further making the micromanagement of your battery unnecessary. See the linked post for further details.\nLeaving it plugged in will surely have pretty much zero effect on your battery.\n\nA: Yes, leaving the charger in will not hurt the battery in the short term. However, you should occasionally allow the battery to be used and not leave it plugged in all the time. The battery works best when it is cycled; Apple has a brief writeup on their use of Lithium Ion batteries in the MacBook line at http://www.apple.com/batteries/why-lithium-ion/, where they state that a complete charge cycle (not the same as charging to 100%) is what will tend to reduce the capacity. A charge cycle can be adding 10% to the battery each day for 10 days, adding 100% of a charge in one day, or anything in between.\n", "Q: Pages won't open after unexpected shut down I have OS X Yosemite v. 10.10.5.

But still, 2 GB are in the other directories and files, so I should be able to do a cleanup and delete most if not all of the files there.\n\nA: The ~/Library/Containers folder contains files saved by sandboxed apps - i.e. typically apps downloaded from the Mac App Store.\nThese apps are not able to write to files anywhere they like on your system, but are constrained to save inside their own folder in the Containers folder.\nThis means that it is not a specific type of data saved here. This means that it is not solely for configuration files, cache files, user data, game levels, etc. - it is a mix of them all.\nTherefore you cannot say that this folder is just safe to delete. Some parts will probably be safe to delete without loosing anything - others won't be. So you'll have to handle it application by application.\n\nA: Go to ~/Library/Containers/ and type du -h command. Now you will be more able to see which folder/file is taking most of the space in the system. My main culprit was Docker.\n", "Q: How to have GNU's date in OS X?

The little wheel at the top is constantly going around.\n\nA: Settings > iCloud > iCloud Drive and turn that off - This worked for me after turning it off, back on, then off again. Restore stopped and then i turned it back on and did a back up. \n\nA: Likely your phone does not have the storage to completely restore your iCloud data, photos etc etc. Or the 5GB you get for iCloud isn't enough to backup your phone with the default settings.\nGo to Settings > iCloud > Photos and untick Download and Keep Originals \nGo back to Settings > iCloud > iCloud Drive and turn that off too. If it continues to 'sync', then try progressively switching off synced items in the 'Settings > iCloud' menu with 5 minute pauses in between, and let us know which is the culprit. You can then go to your browser on a computer and download or remove that synced data.

Do I have USB3 or not? And if it's only one of them, how do I know which one?\n\nA: Knowing what make and model of Mac you have would be very helpful in deciding what you have exactly as the specifications page on that model at apple.com would have the info you seek.\nBut a little interpretation of your screenshot will show that you have two USB busses. One has your FaceTime camera (the camera built into iMacs and MacBooks) and one with the keyboard and IR receiver (that is built into MacBooks).\nNote that there is nothing under the USB 3.0 bus, which likely means there is nothing plugged into either of your USB ports (amiright?). So plug a USB 3 device into one of these ports and bring this report up again. Then try it in the other port. If they show up under the USB 3 bus then both ports are USB 3.\nOr you could just google your Mac's make and model and follow the link to Apple's support site with the specifications of your Mac.\n", "Q: Broken Bootcamp built in audio with macbook Pro mid 2014 win7 x64, SPDIF LED constantly lit Hardware: Macbook Pro retina mid 2014 15\"\nSoftware: MacOS + bootcamp installed win7 x64 with latest updates\nJust recently speakers and headphone port stopped working and the SPDIF red LED light from the headphone socket is now constantly lit (didn't used to be lit at all).

I have a newer (2009 I believe) iMac, running Yosemite.\nIt powers on, the Apple logo and progress bar appear, as well as the mouse cursor, but then nothing happens, the screen just stays on and illuminated. Any ideas as to what's up?\n\nA: it sounds like you never get a logon screen, correct? If so there is likely a problem with the disk, Mac OS or something installed.\nFirst thing to do is to boot up holding the Shift key. When you see the Apple logo you can release it. Now wait for it to boot fully. Safe Mode takes quite a bit longer as it also does some thorough disk checking so be patient.\nIf you can log in, then do so and start turning off startup items as something that was installed is interfering with the boot process.\nIf it still does not boot, reboot and hold CommandR to get into recovery mode. run disk utility and reapir the disk, paying attention to any messages that Disk Utility gives you. If it can't repair the disk you can do one of 3 things: erase the HD (losing all files and settings) and reinstall Mac OS. Reinstall Mac OS right over top of what you already have (if it will let you without reformatting the HD) or get another disk repair utility like DiskWarrior and hope that can fix the issue.\nIf it can repair the disk try booting again. If it finds no problems the Mac OS is likely hosed and needs to be re-installed.\n", "Q: What to do about recent remote code execution vulnerability in git (on El Capitan) The recent remote code execution bug in git looks pretty serious. The way I read this is that if I'm running a git client prior to 2.7.1, I'm susceptible to remote code execution if I use git to interact with a malicious (or compromised) repo. It seems like a manual upgrade of the git client is in order, but rootless prevents things like brew from working. (I'm currently on the latest stable Xcode 7.2.1)\nWhat's the best way forward under El Capitan? Turn off rootless and install with brew?\nInstall an updated git client from source? (latest stable binary appears to be prior to 2.7.1)\nIs there an updated git client in a newer version of Xcode?\n\nA: If you use Homebrew it's pretty easy:\nbrew upgrade git\nwhich git\n=> /usr/local/bin/git\ngit --version\n=> git version 2.7.3\n\nDone.\n\nA: Brew doesn't ever work to replace or patch an OS version - it's consciously designed to only put binaries beside those from Apple and not in place of.\nIf you want to make sure that no program calls Apple's /usr/bin/git or you don't call it, then these steps will accomplish that goal of hardening your 10.11 installs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run OS X Recovery by holding down Command-R while the Mac is starting up.\n\n*Use the Utilities menu to run Terminal\n\n*csrutil disable\n\n*reboot\n\n*Enter single user mode by holding Command-S while the Mac is restarting.\n\n*mount -uw /\n\n*rm /usr/bin/git\n\n*halt\n\n*Repeat the OS X Recovery step and open Terminal and run csrutil enable\n\n*reboot\n\n\nAt this point, the git from Apple is removed.\nSearch for other git binaries:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/git is 2.5.4\n\n*/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/git is 2.5.4\n\n\nYou are at very slight risk since you only ran without SIP in single user mode long enough to remove the one binary. You can also get git 2.7.4 from brew as of March 18, 2016 if you like:\nbrew install git\ngit --version\n\nYou'll want to watch all OS X updates to be sure they don't pop another copy of git that's patched lower than you wish. For most people, I would focus on only connecting to servers that are patched and/or known to be not malicious. Just having the git sitting there is low risk in my read of the situation.\nSome other threads of interest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use downloaded Git instead of preinstalled Git\n\n*Security update for git on mac\n\n*How to properly update git on mac?\n\nA: I don't have any workflow wherein other tools are calling git so I'm ok with simply installing a patched version and using that.\nI did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cloned from the official git repo\n\n*Installed with make && make install\n\n*And prepended ~/bin to my path in .profile\n\n\nThat should work fine for me I think.\nAs for only interacting with trusted sources --sure, that's ideal, but there's no excuse to use a known vulnerable piece of software. There are plenty of examples of trusted sources getting compromised. Having a git clone actually able to execute arbitrary code is undesirable in my view.\n", "Q: CommCenter (from CoreTelephony.framework) is eating 600+ MB of my RAM, why do I even need it?

He bought a new external HD and he wanted to backup all of his pictures (he uses iPhoto). So, I drag and dropped the Pictures folder onto the HD (formatted as HFS+). I'm assuming this also includes his iPhoto Library. I plan on option click open iPhotos and going into preferences to point to the external HD. \nHowever, once I point to the new iPhoto location, what is the easiest way to delete all files within his Pictures folder? Right now he has 370 GB of pictures on his 500 GB MacBook Pro and so needs to make space badly. Also, once the Library is pointed to the external. He will always have to have it connected when trying to import new pictures into his computer correct?\nI know this might seem like a simple question but google wasn't as helpful as I thought it would be. \n\nA: Firstly, yes he has to point to the external HD when trying to import new pictures into his computer.\nThen you can easily delete Photos Library (see following pic) (usually located in: /Users/<name of the user>/Pictures) that package contains all the photos in the application Photos. At the end if he will proceed with emptying the Trash all the pics in the Mac will be deleted.\n\nMore precisely, you can do the same for iPhoto. The library name depends only to the application you are using. So for instance if instead of using Photos, your friend is using iPhoto the library you want to delete will be iPhoto Library!\n", "Q: Numbers: Force a calculation My apologies for such a basic question, but I have searched for many hours to no avail.

I am new to Mac and now also new to the Windows 10 environment so on a huge learning curve. I have managed to set up Office via VMware Fusion virtual machine on my Mac. \nI need to find out how I can mainly find the @ key to work on the Windows side. Or is there a way to make the keyboard work the same on both sides for applications? I will be working in both environments seamlessly so if I can have the same keys work in both that would be great.\n\nA: In most cases the keyboards should behave similarly with the exception of the Command key. \nGo to your Virtual Machine settings and click on Keyboard & Mouse, in there you can pick a profile, the default works pretty well.

Where that phrase is something i can control?\n\nA: As of right now SIRI can only be initiated by you. You can tell SIRI to remind you about something and you will get a notification about it but there is now way to have SIRI come on and say anything.\n\nA: At the moment (up to and including iOS 12), you cannot have Siri speak to you based on an event (time/date, notification from app etc.). Only you can trigger Siri.\nHowever, you could try a few things that may give you an approximation of what you want to do. \n\n\n*\n\n*Shortcuts: you could write a Shortcut in the Shortcuts app that has a time delay and then speaks the text you want. You cannot have this shortcut automatically invoked - you will have to trigger it - via your voice or your fingers - yourself. \n\n*VoiceOver: you could enable VoiceOver to speak out your Reminders, Timers or Alarms. \n\n", "Q: How can I globally disable 'Text Replacement'? I've been looking for an answer to this question for a while, so I'm guessing this can only be solved with a console command.\nWhat I want to do is disable 'Text Replacement' everywhere on my Mac.\nThe trick is, I have a library of text replacements that I use on my iPhone (like ill > I'll), and apparently it's synced to my iCloud account. As a result, if I make changes in one place it affects all of my devices everywhere - making the easy solution of \"delete all of the text substitutions from your substitution library\" is unavailable.\nThe text replacement I'm referring to specifically is the option you can disable by right-clicking on any text input area, then selecting 'Substitutions < Text Replacement' (see image).\n\nI know you can disable this one field at a time by right-clicking fields and unchecking 'Text Replacement', but it is enabled by default for every individual input on every field for every application (including the entire internet and my browser's search/address bar), and it periodically gets re-enabled on some inputs.\nI've already disabled 'Correct Spelling Automatically' from my system text options. (see image)\n\nAnd still I have to disable 'Text Replacement' on every field or it will try to correct my typing with entries in that dictionary.\nI use iCloud tabs, handoff, and a number of Apple's other \"Better Together\" features (and I don't want to lose the ability to track my devices with 'Find my [device]'), so I don't want to disassociate my iCloud account from my computer or devices, but I'd be really happy if I never had to disable 'Text Replacement' on an input field again.\nAny suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated!\nEDIT:\nI've found https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/217387/172938 and https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/121553/172938 , both of which have some console references:\ndefaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool true from the first link (for enabling 'Text Replacement' in Safari).\ndefaults delete -g NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems from the second link (for deleting the User Dictionary as seen in my second image).\nBoth pertain to my issue tangentially, but each to the opposite effect I'm looking for.\n\nA: Very late, but \ndefaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool false\n\nWill disable text replacement not just in Safari but in all other apps that use that input method (e.g. Evernote). \nReboot is required (at least as of macOS 10.13.6), and the menubar checkmark UI won't visually change within each app. The change also only affects applications, and not Spotlight. \n\nA: Somehow I messed up the Keyboard - Text replacement database (drag & dropped a imewlconverter converted plist into the GUI).\nWith 100k+ entries any input becomes very sluggish (I can feel the latency), it's also been synced to iOS (same iCloud ID) which I don't want as I have iRime.\nTried to manually remove all the entries (by selecting all) and click on the - but it didn't work, all entries re-appear like ghosts after a few seconds or simply didn't work.\nDisabling iCloud Drive sync (System Prefs) and retried, didn't work either. It does NOT matter (on or off syncing System Prefs).\nTurned out to be: I've opened Keyboards - Text Replacement on iOS which still had the huge list of entries at the time, the action triggered an instant sync back from iOS to macOS (really!).\n\n\ndefaults delete -g NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems did not work for me on macOS 10.14.\n\n\nLater on I figured out (thanks to find and fd), it is possible to remove all TextReplacements.db* files under ~/Library/KeyboardServices, open Keyboard - Text again to regenerate the text replacement DB files, issue resolved.\nThe files needs to be removed and generated\nTextReplacements.db\nTextReplacements.db-wal\nTextReplacements.db-shm\n\nWorked on both macOS 10.14 and 10.15.\n\nNOTE: Last but not least, do a Reset Keyboard Dictionary on iOS devices with the huge list of entries to avoid syncing back to macOS.\n\nIMPORTANT: be aware of iCloud sync across multiple iOS / macOS devices, the sync can be instant so the text replacement items may mysteriously come back, check every device and make sure they don't push (sync) to other devices.\nMission accomplished.\n\nA: As far as I know, there is still no good solution to this problem (as of late 2018 and 10.14.1).  It was one of the first things I checked when I installed Mojave, and I was disappointed yet again.\nI believe the problem is that the text replacement setting is very granular, per-window/tab. There is no per-app or global switch that will be respected. (The defaults write command described above may help in some apps/contexts, but definitely not most.) Text replacement relentlessly defaults to ON in any new window/tab, with a few odd exceptions.  In apps where all the action happens in one window (e.g. Messages), you can turn it off and largely forget it, but in apps where you're constantly generating new windows/tabs, text replacement is effectively unkillable — if you have them, you will trigger them.\n\nA: I have found this solution on the web, I am quoting:\nhttps://attonblog.blogspot.com/2019/11/disable-text-replacement-on-safari-in-mojave.html\nIn conclusion:\nYou can remove all Text Replacement settings on your Mac by running the following command:\n$ echo 'delete from ZTEXTREPLACEMENTENTRY;' | sqlite3 ~/Library/KeyboardServices/TextReplacements.db\n\n$ defaults delete -g NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems\n\nText Replacement will no longer occur on macOS.\nIt's just a delete, so if you add a setting on the iOS side, you'll need to delete the synced setting again.\n", "Q: Why is there a yellow bar over my Finder icon?

Your only option is to Export your document to that format, which obviously isn't nearly as easy as simply hitting the Save button.\nIt's important to note that Pages support of .doc/.docx isn't perfect.

Is there a way of fixing it?\nThe problem with my MacBook Pro 2014 started when it took a water damage. The only ostensible casualty was the wifi function, and apple told me it was caused by the breaking down of the wifi airport card. There is apparently other hardware damage, but no other symptom that I can see. But to fix the whole thing will cost almost as much as a new machine, so I decided to buy a USB adapter (http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/cat-11_Archer-T4U.html) to regain the wifi function.  \nThe external adapter was working fine for a week, the only problem being that I cannot log in to the appstore, with the error message \"An unexpected error occurred while signing in, Your device or computer could not be verified\". So I followed the advice here and deleted /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist. Stupidly, I did not make a copy. After a reboot, the status bar looks perfectly fine, and shows me connected to the network (itself fine, too), but there's just no connection to the Internet. I've tried restoring the preference file from a month ago and re-installing the usb adapter driver, but no improvement. I am eliciting your help for any ways to fix this, or any suggestions of what to try. \n\nA: System Preferences > Network\nIf you can see your USB adapter in the list unplug it, Delete the entry using the \"-\" button bottom left of list of devices.\nThen plug it back in, if it fails to auto detect then press the \"+\" button and add your USB adapter.\nIf it doesn't show your adapter in the list:\nthen press the \"+\" button and add your USB adapter.\nOnly do this if the option above don't work, it could be the permissions have gone awry  on the directory to NetworkInterfaces.plist , in which case use disk utility to repair permissions on your hard drive, select the Volume such as \"Macintosh HD\" not the physical drive when you do this.\nIf you are on El Capitan you will need run from teh Terminal\ncsrutil status\nIf System Integrity Protection is enabled (which it should be in most cases), then the command output will indicate so. Being enabled will in turn indicate that permissions have been checked and maintained.\n", "Q: How to move from beta to stable releases of OS X I have this VM which is currently on OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.4 Beta\nI would like stop downloading beta in future and just use latest stable version\nI have unenroll from the beta program\nNow when 10.11.4 Stable version becomes available would i be able to upgrade to that one?\nWhat is the best way to unenroll and go to stable releases in future?\n\nA: Apple Store preferences options disappeared on newer releases and so far the only way to unenroll seems to be via the command line\nsudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog\n\n\nA: The answer is in the link you posted:\n\nIt is recommended that you keep your device enrolled in the program until the next commercial version of the software you are testing becomes available from the Mac App Store. If you must reinstall a previously-released version of OS X, you need to restore your Mac using the Time Machine backup that you created before you installed the OS X public beta.\n\nSo, you could leave now and then when 10.11.4 is released to everyone, the App Store will update your beta with no need to erase or back up anything. \n", "Q: Edit (colorized) terminal output before printing?

Please add the bookmarks once syncing has completed\n\nwhen attempting to add a bookmark or favorite in Safari and how can it be prevented?\n\nA: Your iPad or any iOS/macOS device logged into an iCloud with Safari sharing in Settings -> iCloud -> Safari will sync history, bookmarks, and logins. Any changes to the bookmarks will trigger the sync, forcing you to wait. Its a pain in the arse to manage bookmarks with this always popping up.\nDisable the syncing in your iCloud settings under Safari.\n\nA: It's part of iCloud!

To search for apps only, set entity to software. If you want to call this from your website via JavaScript, you'll probably also need to set callback to something appropriate. \nHere is an example search URL which will return results for apps with \"myApp\" https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=MyApp&entity=software\n\nA: You could use Google and the site: scheme.\nAs an example, you could type in the search engine:\nsite:itunes.apple.com sleep\n\nThis will list all the apps from the itunes.apple.com site that contain the keyword sleep.\n\nA: To get a link, there is a way.\n- Go into Itunes\n- Click on the apps popdown and choose \"create a link\"\nThen you get something like :\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/APPNAME/id1078891695?mt=8\nthis can be sent\nVery frustrating, that there is no way to get this link without ITunes.

Only one device at the time. \nI think the power system may be in bad shape. \nBattery is good according to battery softwares. \nI can also feel the accumulation of electricity in some parts of the corners of the computer.

However, I should have some sort of evidence that there is some problem. \nThe observation is just that you cannot use two USB devices at the same time, and the accumulation of the electric current. Sometimes, strange read/write errors. \n\nHow can you justify dysfunctional USB connections?\n\nA: Look in:\nApple Menu > About this Mac\nThen click \"System Report\" button\nFrom USB in the sidebar you can see for each device \"current available\" and \"current required\" if you plug in a device and it needs more than 500MA then it need an external power source!\nIf however you are plugging in two and each one requires more than 500MA they will need an external power source!\nIf this is not the case and each device is 500Ma or less you have youre proof!\nI think static on the case alone should warrant Apple fixing the device.\n\n", "Q: What is the normal temperature for a Retina 15\" unibody mid-2015 MBP?

I want it to act just like the Japanese input source, but use my own glyphs.\nEDIT 2: Renaming the question to make it more clear.\n\nA: The conversion of letters into glyphs is done by the keyboard, not by the font.  So there is no need to create a font, unless you want to generate glyphs not in Unicode.  If you want to type two letters and have it turned into an already existing glyph, there are lots of ways, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the US keyboard and make entries in the replacement grid of system prefs/keyboard/text.\n\n*create a custom keyboard layout with the Ukelele or Karabiner apps.\n\n*create a custom input method as mentioned in OS X: Create and use your own input source\nIf you want to duplicate the mechanism of the Japanese keyboard, you will need to examine the workings of system/library/input methods/JapaneseIM.app\nIf you want to create a font with custom glyphs, there are various apps for that like Fontlab, Fontforge, Robofont, Type, and Glyphs.

About 2 almost 3 years ago I purchased an iPod touch 5. My phone and my iPod both have 2 different Apple ID's (same as 2 different email addresses). The email address used for my iPod is an email I no longer use and I'm not sure if I deactivated it or not. Anyway when I go to Settings> iCloud> it still tells me that same old email address.\n\nA: Sign in with your old Apple ID at iCloud.com, go to Settings->Manage (Apple ID)->Click on your iPod and remove it from the list of devices. And finally use your new Apple ID on your iPod.\n\nA: Contact apple directly, only they can authorise Apple ID merges or the transfer of products from one ID to another. \nUse the link below to get the details. I would have my passport/ID at hand, you may also have to send them a scan of proof of purchase or proof of identity.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204169\n", "Q: Dual Boot Mavericks + El Capitan I was using El Capitan without issues till now. I'm starting to use Pro Tools 10 which is incompatible with El Capitan, so I will need to install a previous OS X version like Mavericks to make it work.\nI really don't want to transfer all my files and downgrade my Mac, so I came up with the idea of dual booting my Mac. Is there any way to install Mavericks and use it like it was another Mac, even though it would be in the same physical drive?\nI won't need to share any files between these two OS, so I will be using Mavericks when I have work to do on Pro Tools, and El Capitan for the rest of the time.\nI think I can get Mavericks from Internet Recovery, as my Mac came with this OS X version. Using a new version of Pro Tools (now compatible with El Capitan) isn't an option for me now.\nThanks!\nPS: Just found this community and from what I read it seems great!\nMacbook Pro Retina 13\" Late 2013\n\nA: What you need to do is to create another partition on your Mac, and install Mavericks on it:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your El Capitan partition, open Disk Utility (in Utilities) and select the physical hard drive in your Mac. It should be titled \"APPLE HDD ... MEDIA\" or something similar:\n\n*Click \"Partition\" and click the \"+\" sign at the bottom of the pie-chart hard drive. Select how big you want the new partition to be and give it a name:\n\n\n*Make sure the format is \"OS X Extended (Journaled)\" and click \"Apply\". It may take a few minutes to create your new partition.\n\n*Next, you will need to obtain a copy of the OS X Mavericks installer. If you have previously downloaded it, you can redownload it from the \"Purchased\" page in the Mac App Store, you could download it from a friend's computer (if he has purchased OS X Mavericks), or if you are on a paid Apple developer account subscription you could download a build on the ADC Downloads page.\n\n\nIf you have the Mavericks version of Internet Recovery, as you said you might, you can boot into it by holding Command-N at startup and clicking \"Reinstall OS X Mavericks\", and skip to step 10 and onwards. However, it is possible that with an OS X upgrade the process upgraded your version of Internet Recovery to the El Capitan version, for example.\n\n\n*Once you have the OS X Mavericks installer, you should copy it to a USB thumb drive. Copy the installer onto the thumb drive by dragging-and-dropping in the Finder.\n\n*Leave the USB drive in your computer with the Mavericks installer.\n\n*Shut down your Mac.\n\n*Hold the \"option\" key while turning your Mac on. You can release the \"option\" key until you see the Apple logo.\n\n*You will be presented with icons of your hard drives and external drives. Use the arrow keys to select the USB drive you made with the Mavericks installer on it and press the \"Enter\" key.\n\n*Go through the Mavericks installer process. When prompted for which disk you want to install Mavericks on, choose the new partition you created in Disk Utility.\n\n*The Mavericks installer will copy over all the files needed, and restart as part of the process. \n\n*You will be taken through initial setup of your \"new computer\" and when it is finished you will be using OS X Mavericks on a partition of the hard drive.\n\n*You can select which OS to boot into at startup by holding the \"option\" key while turning it on until you see the Apple logo. Use the arrow keys to select which partition.\n\n*You can set your default startup disk (i.e. what disk the computer automatically boots into without having to hold the \"option\" key) in System Preferences > Startup Disk.\n\n\nA: An alternate approach, if you haven't already upgraded, is to use CarbonCopyCloner to make a full bootable backup of your hard drive before upgrading.\nYou can even make the backup, boot from the external drive, and then upgrade that installation instead of upgrading the OS that's directly on your computer.  Then play around with the upgrade before you fully commit to it.\nI used CCC successfully to partition up an external hard drive and install multiple Mac OSes on it, so that I could boot my computer from Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion or Mavericks.\nAnd of course you should have a full backup of your computer anyway, even if you don't need to boot to a different Mac OS.\n\nI'm not affiliated with CCC, but I think it's awesome and every Mac power user should be using it.  :)\n", "Q: MacBook Air won't power on, except I remove the battery and plug it back in (SMC reset?) - sleep works I have a bizarre problem with my 2012 MacBook Air 13\":\nAt some point, a couple of weeks ago, it suddenly stopped turning on. The battery would charge, but pressing the power-button just wouldn't have an effect. I clearing the SMC by pressing Shift-Control-Option, which didn't have any effect. I tried different power adapters.\nThen in a last-ditch effort I decided to open it up. Much to my surprise it did boot up just fine after: disconnecting the battery, pressing the power button (with AC not attached), reconnecting the battery, reconnecting AC power, and pressing power.\nThe weird thing is that everything (including the power button, going to sleep etc) just works, just when I shut down OS X completely, the same problem occurs (all the times), making it necessary to unscrew the bottom and do aforementioned procedure again ;)\nHave anyone heard of this problem before? Are there some specific components on the logic board that could be causing this? (I am not sure if it's worth having this repaired through official channels.)\nUpdate: To clarify the symptoms when the Air doesn't boot up: black screen, no fan, no keyboard backlight (or anything else that would indicate that it is running).\n\nA: There are two possible causes these symptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*Faulty Battery\n\n*Bad SMC Chip (Logic Board)\nFaulty Battery.  As the OP described, once the battery was disconnected, the machine booted fine.  What could be happening here is that the battery life has degraded to the point where it will not hold a charge above the threshold to power on the device.  \nIf you can power the MBA in this manner, try resetting the SMC then reconnect the battery.  If it continues to fail, you probably need a new battery.  If you already know how to open the MBA and disconnect the battery, you are halfway to replacing it.  If you're not sure, ifixit.com has an excellent tutorial.\nGiven that the OP's machine is a 2012, it would mean the battery is pushing 5 years now which is around the EOL for this battery.  It's time for a replacement.  I recommend getting one with at least a 18 month warranty.\n\nFaulty SMC.  There is a possibility that the SMC (chip) is faulty.  The first thing to attempt to diagnose it would be to run Apple Hardware Test (AHT).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.  \nIt may come back with \"no errors\" so the positive diagnostic test would be to attempt with a known \"good\" battery.  If it continues to fail after the battery is replaced, there's a high chance than the SMC is bad.  It's time to take it in for service.\n", "Q: How can I duplicate a pdf page without doubling the file size? I have a large single page PDF file of a poster that is 200 megs.

I am aware how to compress the image...this is not the solution that I am looking for. I am also aware that I can simply print a single page 10 times...again, this is not the solution that I am looking for. \nThanks.\n\nA: You can do that by turning the page into a Template, and then spawn it with the XObject parameter.\nYou will need Acrobat Pro for that, and you will use Acrobat JavaScript, which means you should have a good look at the Acrobat JavaScript documentation.\n", "Q: Dtrace script newproc.d stopped working after upgrade, because of missing proc:::exec-success probe I'm trying to run:\n$ sudo /usr/bin/newproc.d\n\nwhich suppose to snoop new processes as they are executed, but it fails with the error:\n\ndtrace: failed to compile script /usr/bin/newproc.d: line 22: probe description proc:::exec-success does not match any probes\n\nThis is on OS X 10.11.2 and as far as I remember, this was working before the upgrade.\nIt seems new OS X doesn't have anymore proc:::exec-success probe as I've checked by:\n$ sudo dtrace -l | grep proc:::exec-success\n\nFailing code of that script (note: this was provided by the system, I haven't changed it):\nproc:::exec-success\n{\n  print_pid[pid] = 1; /* This pid emerged from an exec, make a note of that. */\n}\n\nIs that probe was removed or renamed to different probe? Maybe I could activate it somehow? Otherwise what I can use instead?\n\nA: This is probably because of the \"Rootless\" feature in El Capitan.\nYou can disable this feature by rebooting into recovery mode and running the command csrutil disable (and you can similarly reenable it with csrutil enable).\nThere is a great explanation over at this Ask Different question: What is the “rootless” feature in El Capitan, really? The second answer addresses Dtrace directly.\n\nA: To be even more secure, you can run:\ncsrutil enable --without dtrace\n\nbut this is not intended for production use according to Apple.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 Logic Board Water Damage Clean/Repair I'm aware of this question, however it doesn't solve my problem.\nToday I bought a water damaged iPhone 6 at a good price, thinking that since I am pretty decent at repairing iPhones (and fixing water damaged ones before), that I should be able to fix it without any issues and have a working iPhone 6.

I want to create a service which will be shown in the context menu when I right-click on any link in the Safari (need get the URL into the service).\nThis is my current contextual services menu on the right-click to any Safari link, eg. want add the my service to this menu.\n\nAny suggestion?\nEDIT\nFor the simplicity, I want:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a service (by the Automator or by any other way)\n\n*let say the service name should be: \"Save URL\"\n\n*the \"Save URL\" service should appear in the Services context menu when I right-click on any link in Safari\n\n*The real workflow of the service isn't the matter. Just want to know how to create a service which will appear in the context menu.\n\n*but, if you want - for the simplicity let's say - the service should do only one simple thing: open a new TextEdit document and add the URL of the given (right-clicked) link into it.\n\n\nI tried to create an Automator Service, but the saved service doesn't show up in the menu.\n\nA: UPDATE: I initially misunderstood the question. To learn how to create a service for the context menu in Safari, see part A of this answer. To learn how to create a service that takes no input and appears in the menubar > Safari > Services menu in Safari, see part B.\nPart A: Creating a Contextual Text Service\nStep 1\nFollow part B's step 1 (I'll refer to it as B.1 from here on out).\nStep 2\nFollow B.2, but instead of selecting \"no input,\" select \"rich text.\"\n\nIn this case, you won't want to use anything else, because this is the step that makes it possible to see it from the contextual right-click menu when selecting text. This is because Automator requires some sort of input usually, and the type of input determines how it will get that input. If it's manual input, then it'll simply ask for the input when it runs, but if it's some sort of text that's already on the screen, it needs selected text to function. Note that you can't choose \"URLs\" because that does not mean that you can right click on URLs on the webpage, but that you can save the URL of the current page using the menubar. I chose \"rich text\" for this because it saves the text with its URL properties (i.e. you can click on it and it'll take you to the webpage once it's in the TextEdit document).\nStep 3\nAs with B.3, write your workflow. In this case, it's really simple (there will be no download link because you can make it so easily):\n\nIn this case, all I'm doing is taking the input of the selected rich text as specified, and then copying it into a new TextEdit document, which should open up with the link once you've used the service.\nStep 4\nFinish things off by saving, as in B.4, and optionally do B.5 if you want to see where your services are located.\n\nIf you're looking to do something more advanced, like copying the URL from selected text, that would be more complicated, but feel free to experiment with it. You can always try URL shortening to create links, or perhaps have Automator open that webpage in a new tab and copy its URL as with the script in B.3.\nPart B: Creating a Menubar URL Service\nStep 1\nFirst, you'll want to make sure that the workflow you created is a \"Service\" workflow. To do so, when you create a workflow, select the \"Service\" option like so:\n\nClick on \"Choose\" and you're ready to create your service. You should see the typical Automator workflow builder window, as usual.\nStep 2\nOnce you're there, make sure that you say your application is for Safari, using the menu at the top of the window. The other dropdown menu determines whether or not the Automator workflow takes any input. Depends on what you're doing, but in this case, I think you don't need any input, so select \"no input.\"\n\nStep 3\nAt that point, go ahead and build your workflow. It sounds like you already have a workflow you want to use, but here's one I built to do what you'd like:\n\nAt this point, you'll see that the service does not yet show up in the dropdown in Safari.\n\nStep 4\nIn order to make it show up, make sure you've saved your Automator workflow.\n\nThe header on Automator should look like this: \nIf you check Safari now, your \"Save URL\" service should come up.\n\nStep 5 (optional)\nIf you really want to check that your service was saved because it still isn't showing up in the menu, you can go to ~/Library/Services/ in Finder, where all workflows are stored. Keep in mind that the Library folder is hidden if you've never accessed it before. You can go here to find out how to view it and its contents.\n\n", "Q: We need some help on how to utilize the Apple ID on multiple Apple computers in a network We have 8 Apple Computers on a network in a dental office where users move from machine to machine and have no need to use any Apple ID capabilities.

In chrome I am getting the error as ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED and in Safari it shows as Server is not responding\nAgain reiterating, its only for a few sites I am getting this message and others are working fine. Any idea what I need to check? \nP.S - On initial googling I have added both the browsers to the firewall exception list.\nAlso please note that I am completely new to a mac and so need explicit instructions to follow (sorry for that - but till now I havent used anything else except Windows!!)\nLet me know if I need to provide any other info!\n\nA: This post from the Apple Support Communities might help: Link\nThings to try according to this post:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings/Networks/Advanced/Proxys, Discover new proxys\n\n*Check the ignored domains for blocked domains\n\n*Safari/Preferences/Advanced - enable the Develop menu, then empty caches\n\n*Safari/History/Show History - delete all history items\n\n*Restart your router (obvious one, but often works well)\n\n\nOne other thing to try:\n - Change the DNS server to Google: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4\n", "Q: Is it possible to get the text log for Disk Utility First Aid check? Does/can the standard Disk Utility in OS X (El Capitan) log the \"First Aid\" disk check results in text file?\nCopy paste does not work on this control and to record the whole log I had to take 22 screenshots.\nOr maybe there is a CLI counterpart to this check?\n\n\nA: The CLI counterpart would be diskutil repairVolume /Volumes/MyPassport.\n", "Q: Problems reconnecting to WiFi if connection is lost In the area where I live there are frequent power outages for a few seconds.  I am connected via a router, which (of course) restarts each time.  Unfortunately my Mac (2011 MB Pro) does not automatically reconnect to the WiFi after the router has restarted and I have to manually reselect the network.  \nAllan's answer below provided a temporary solution by simply trashing the airport preferences.  Unfortunately this solution only worked for a short time and now my Macbook won't reconnect again.  Does anyone have any further ideas?  \nI had assumed this was a problem of the router (and maybe it is) and therefore in the original question asked, whether it was possible to have some script or app run in the background that monitors whether WiFi is connected and when it's not it either tries to reconnect or to turn WiFi on and off or something that would ensure that I regain access.  \nNonetheless, finding the root of the problem would obviously be preferred.  Any help greatly appreciated! \n\nA: The WiFi on your MBP is, by design, supposed to reconnect to known networks automatically without the intervention of the user and/or an automated script.\nThat said, WiFi issues seem to have been an ongoing issue for Apple:  How do I connect my Mac to wifi automatically?\nNow, I am assuming that this is a simple home network where you just have to select the network you want to connect to and provided you have the right passphrase or key, you get connected and away you go.  \nGiven that you have a MacBook and it's portable, have you tried different networks - like gone over to a friends or a relatives home and see if the systems exhibit there?  If so, then the issue is limited to your MB, and not the router.\nAlso, does anyone else report having the issue with your router?  If not, it will again confirm that the problem is with your MBP and not the router itself.\nWhat you can try:  Delete the Airport .plist\nTo  delete the plist file associated to the Airport,\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Airport\n\n*Delete the plist file; /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n\n*Re-enable airport and select your favorite network again\n\n\nThis will delete ALL connections of the connections in your saved WiFi networks. You will need to save all of the passwords for all the networks that you want to connect to later.\n\nHow to get your WiFi Passwords\nBefore you delete the plist, you will want to make a copy of all your SSID passwords.  They are stored in your Keychain.\nWhen you open your Keychain (CommandSpace and type \"Keychain\" to use Spotlight to open it) you will see a list of saved credentials from websites, to network passwords and of course the one we are interested in, Airport Passwords.\n\nIf you right click on the WiFi network you are interested in, you will have the option to \"Copy the Password to the Clipboard\" (how convenient is that?!?!)\n\nYou will be then asked to authenticate 2 times.  The first time because OS X will want to \"make changes to your computer\" and then a second time because it wants access to your \"System Keychain\"\n\nThis will require you to type your user name and password of an Administrator (if that's you, then your username and password).\nYou can now paste that password anywhere...\n\nOr maybe in a spreadsheet for safekeeping...\n\n\nA: The simple solution I use is an economical UPS to your router which has enough battery power to last through these outages. Better UPSs can also help protect devices from power surges.\n", "Q: Apple Mail in El Capitan - where is data that used to be in Accounts.pilst? I run about six IMAP accounts on two different OS X machines and one iOS device. \nSeveral of the mail accounts are under different domains, but all hosted on the same 3rd party mail provider so presumably running identical IMAP and SMTP servers. Also, the settings on the OS X mail clients in Mail/preferences/accounts look identical, except for the account-specific settings like name/password, etc.\nNonetheless, still I have a several undesired behaviors, different both between accounts and between clients, which I can't seem to fix. \nPrior to El Capitan I would have looked for causes of these differing mail account behaviors in ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist. That file is still there, but it seems to be an unused, outdated leftover from an OS upgrade, as it shows no current mail account settings.\nMeanwhile, looking at the several plist files in both ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail and ~/Library/Mail/V3, I find none of the mail account settings I want to see.\nSo in El Cap, where does one find the equivalent mail account settings data that used to be in ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist ?\n(OSX 10.11.3, Mail 9.2)\n\nA: I recently tested Mail in a new User account to find all the files that are modified after adding an account to Mail. \nThese following files contain account info. I can't say with certainty that you will need to reset all files in order to reset your account. Remember to log out/in and empty the trash before resetting. Make sure you have backup if needed.\n~/Library/Accounts folder\nAccounts3.sqlite\nAccounts3.sqlite-shm\nAccounts3.sqlite-wal\n~/Library/Preferences/MobileMeAccounts.plist\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist\n\nA: I had problems with all Mail accounts and data missing after upgrade. It came out the problem was invalid import of existing account under El Cap's Internet Accounts.\nWhat helped was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove data from ~/Library/Accounts (actually copied the folder to ~/Library/Accounts.bak to save as backup, then removed the 3 files under it),\n\n*log out of OS X user account and again back in\n\n*restore Mail data from before upgrade (old Mail.app held data in ~/Library/Mail/V2 but now it's under ~/Library/Mail/V3: important was to restore the old V2 directory, especially ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist)\n\n*if you use symlinks to refer to other location of mail data than standard (~/Library/Mail) then make sure now the link works and disks are mounted)\n\n*run /System/Library/InternetAccounts/internetAccountsMigrator\n\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro is crashing with kernel panic.

I have a 4TB Lacie P9230 external drive which has been working for about a year just fine. The drive has been partitioned into two partitions, one for TM backups and other as archive and other stuff that isn't important or can be downloaded from the internet. When I tried to enable Time Machine encryption, the process failed and the backup partition disappeared. Disk Utility listed it as grey and couldn't mount it or something. Then I did the wisest thing and simply unplugged the drive's power cord and reconnected. Now it's in this weird state where the volume apparently doesn't have a file system nor does the backup partition. The archive partition has a file system (JHFS+) and it is visible in Finder, but all the folders are there but they empty even though Disk Utility shows the correct amount of data used.

When trying this with the same image in the mask, it simply fades it, rather than animates it, not really sure why this is, it is like it is not detecting that the position of the image within the mask, just that it has changed.\nIs there any way round this?\n\nA: I actually figured it out myself.

I just started using TextWrangler in place of Eclipse for writing Java programs. I found a script for testing Java programs in Terminal, but I’d like to handle everything right through TextWrangler.

Or is there a Java shebang which is specifically for TextWrangler? \n\nA: Here is a simple wrapper script that effectively can work as a Java shebang on OS X and Linux:\n# /* ------- build and run wrapper script for Java -----------------------------\nTMP=$(mktemp -d)\ntail -c +3 ${0} > ${TMP}/$(basename ${0})\ncd ${TMP} && javac $(basename ${0}) && java $(basename ${0%.*}) ${@:1}\nRV=${?} ; cd - > /dev/null ; rm -rf ${TMP}\nexit ${RV}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------- */\n\npublic class example {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello world\");\n    }\n}\n\nHowever, as pointed out in the comments this is technically not a \"shebang\", but it comes pretty close in terms of functionality.\n\nA: #! /usr/bin/java  --source=11\n\nThe --source argument is required.

As soon as the recipient will have downloaded the file, you'll receive a confirmation email. Name of file: IMG_0508.mov\", dimension: 30 MB\", and there was a link to download. After 1 minute I received another email telling me that the file was indeed downloaded by the recipient.\nThe problem is that I never used WeTransfer, wasn't even aware of its existence 10 minutes ago! Apparently it's a legitimate service, which I never used. I don't know whose that email belong to (even though the email provider is well known in Italy) and I have no clue what is going on. Obviously I did not click on any link on the email, thinking it was just a scam mail that tries to make you click on the download button to install some malware.\nBut given that the company seems genuine, I'm worried that some hackers have somehow compromised my system and sent themselves a file with my stuff, and immediately downloading it (30 MB in one minute means the recipient is ready to receive the email). On the other hand I wonder why they would put my email address for me to receive such an email... \nI disabled the wifi of the Mac and I am writing this from my phone. I also started a full system scan with BitDefender virus scanner (don't know how helpful it is, but still. I do it once in a blue moon though, never found anything)\nSo what has happened? What do I do now to protect myself?\nEdit\nI received another email just now. Apparently this person just sent me back this file, and WeTransfer informs me that I can now download this. So to recap: 1st email is about me sending file A to person B, 2nd email one minute later is to tell me that person B downloaded file A, and finally 10 minutes later to tell me that person B has sent me file A.\nP.S. having trouble adding tags from the phone \n\nA: Or person C mistyped their email address and you're receiving their notifications.\nNot at all unusual.\n\nA: Firstly, we need to find out what exactly are the contents of the 30 MB file they sent with your email. Check the sender's actual email address. I advise you right click the download link, select Copy Link Address and paste it into your browser. This will tell us if it is a phishing scam or a virus deployment scheme.\nBEFORE HITTING ENTER, read the link: what does it say? I've never used WeTransfer before, so;\nCase 1: If the link seems legitimate and doesn't take the form of an IP address or a clearly non-WeTransfer affiliated site:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the file from the link.\n\n*If the file format is a form of compressed archive (.zip, .7z etc), take caution. Apple's Gatekeeper should prevent any unauthorised programs from running though. It would be best to use Pacifist to unpack the archive.\n\n*Either in Pacifist or Finder, look through the contents of the sent file. If any of your personal data has been compromised, do the usual \"change all passwords\" routine.\n\n\nCase 2: If the link does not seem legitimate and takes the form of an IP address or a clearly non-WeTransfer affiliated site:\n\n\n*\n\n*DON'T DOWNLOAD ANYTHING. I would advise against doing so, but if you feel confident you can use the above three steps and apply them to here.\nCase 3: If the link redirects you to an appearance-legitimate-address-weird page (e.g random address: healthproducts.com asking for Google credentials and looks like a legit Google site) prompting you for your credentials:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't enter anything. This is a classic phishing scam.\n\n\nYou can also try the above steps on the file they sent back.\nEDIT: Tyson's second comment is correct indeed. It is in the nature of such scams to make you concerned about how they got your email address et cetera, so they want your email address (which they already know) and your password (which they don't). Definitely use the \"change all passwords\" routine here.\n", "Q: Applescript code to find path to Desktop picture in Desktop 2 I need an applescript that will find the path to the desktop picture used in Desktop 2.

I'm very confused here..\n\nA: Apple does not support running Windows from USB drives. This does not mean you can not, just that Apple does not provide a way to do so. This also does not mean you can run Windows from an USB drive. I lot depends on which Mac you own. For sure, the Boot Camp Assistant is not going to help install Windows on a USB drive.\nAfter installing Windows (internally) using the aid of the Boot Camp Assistant application, Windows boots and executes exactly the same as if you installed on a PC. In fact, you can install Windows on your Mac without OS X installed. One user posted where the Boot Camp Assistant was used to create the USB Windows Installer. Once booted from this installer, the internal disk was wiped clean of OS X and Windows was installed as the only operating system.\nThe company twocanoes offer a product called WinClone. They claim it can be used to migrate Windows to an USB drive and then booted using a Mac. See the link Migrate Windows 8 or higher to an External Drive . The key word here is migration. Windows was installed somewhere else, then migrated (copied) to the USB drive.\nInstructions for installing Windows 10 on an external drive can be found as several answers to the question: Is it possible to use Boot Camp with Windows 10 from an external HDD? \nPersonally, I prefer my answer which only requires the external drive and the Windows 10 ISO file.\n", "Q: My iPhone Literally Gets Full When I Connect To Computer 0 bytes available even though the apps on my phone aren't close to filling the 16GB.

Try to disable/limit sync for apps like Google Drive, Dropbox or even fitness apps where you have to download training videos, etc.\n\nA: I found the solution. Back up to computer, encrypt, then restore that backup from computer.

I have a MacBook Pro Retina, so it has an SSD but no HDD. I use Dr. Cleaner and I've often noticed that when 99% of the app memory is being used, the OS X El Capitan freezes. At this point of time, nothing works: not my trackpad nor my keyboard. There is no choice but to hold down the power button and hard shut down. \nMy question is: Considering that I have SSD and not HDD, is it ok to hard shut down frequently? Do I run any risk other than corrupting the currently open files?\nEDIT: I have 8GB RAM and generally 99% of the app memory is used when I use safari and have other apps like google chrome (multiple windows) open. \nUPDATE: After some researching and scouring, I found out that a force shutdown on a mac does not harm the SSD, but I am still unsure about the OSX. So does a force shutdown harm the OSX in any way? Or is the only risk losing some data (eg. word document)?\n\nA: OSX will always try to use the maximum available RAM that way it can perform better, and it is Operating Systems job to deal with it anyway, and in general OSX do a good job in that regard. You don't spend on that much RAM if you are not going to utilize it isn't it.\nHowever, Try Alt+Cmd+Escape that would bring \"Force Quit Applications\" and you can force quit any App that's not responding or Relaunch Finder. If that works that should be the first thing you do. If it doesn't you should go for the hard restart.\nIf it happens frequently, take it to an AppleStore. You may have a software/hardware issue.\n\nA: I would suggest patience. When your computer lags (I'm going to assume you have the spinning beach ball), it's probably doing something behind the scenes - a forced shutdown should only ever be used as a last resort method when your computer has been unresponsive for the past three hours or so.\nThe best method to get your computer back to normal is to use Force Quit (keyboard combination Option ⌥Command ⌘Esc ⎋) - this might take a while to show up under those memory usage conditions (note: your keyboard is still \"responsive\", just really, really slow), but it will.\nWhen it does, select the app causing the slowdown (again, this may take some time) and click \"Force Quit\" (yes, this may take some time as well). The app will quit (eventually) and your system should return to normal.\nIf the problem persists, though, I would either inform the developer of the app and/or if the problem is not limited to one app, take it in to Apple for advice.\n", "Q: Can IPv6 be disabled on an iPad? TL;DR: Can I disable IPv6 on an iPad?\nStrange issue that I've just figured out. For months I've been seeing content show up in Netflix that should be unavailable to me (I'm in Canada), or things that should be available not showing up. Sometimes I'll pause a show and when I restart it, I'll get an error that it's not available in my region!\nI just realized that I'm getting my IPv6 connectivity through a Hurricane Electric tunnel, which of course is American. I'm thinking this explains a lot of the transient problems I've been having with Netflix, especially w/r/t regions. My primary device for viewing is an iPad, so I want to disable IPv6 on it. \nIt doesn't seem like it's possible; I can't even see what my IP is from the network settings, but thought I'd throw it out there and see if anyone know any tricks. Thanks!\n\nA: No - iOS has no profile or setting to disable IPv6. Even if you jailbreak, I don't know how to set that on iOS operating systems.\nYes I am also using a Hurricane Electric tunnel for IPv6. I have similar problems with my two iMac computers. I have to set my IPv6 to \"link local only\". This fixed my connection problems. \nThis partial solution (controlling the router) only works over WiFi though - cellular data carrier routing also would need to be changed if you can't allow IPv6.\n\nA: As stated, you can’t disable IPv6 in iOS but if you have access to the router settings, you can disable it there so that the router no longer connects using IPv6. Worked for me in keeping my home automation and media system accessible.\n", "Q: How to unlock an iPad 2 Without Restoring Back to Original Factory Settings My iPad is locked. Is there a way in which I can unlock it without having to restore it to factory settings? Is there a software program that helps?\n\nA: I assumed you cannot unlock your iPad, and your iPad is not \"locked\" in some other way. In this case, as far as I am aware, the best way is to back it up to a computer, then factory resetting it. After it has been reset, simply restore data back into the iPad, and the iPad will be like before but without the passcode lock.\n", "Q: USB external harddrive not being recognised My WD 2 TB hard drive has suddenly stopped being recognized by my MacBook Pro, running OS X 10.11.3, but it's working on my ThinkPad, running Windows 7 and Linux Mint.

An iOS device (iPad or iPhone) receives notifications, even when the device is sleeping. Apple calls these “push notifications”.\nHow does the device receive these notifications? Are there any periodic (recurring) actions involved? If so, what actions are they and how often do they occur?\n\nA: From the Apple Push Notification Service documentation:\n\nEach device establishes an accredited and encrypted IP connection\n  with APNs and receives notifications over this persistent connection.\n\nThis means it uses some sort of socket-based persistent connection. It could be its own proprietary protocol, or WebSocket, etc. The \"periodic actions\" you're asking about are usually implemented in these protocols at the lowest level possible using TCP/IP sockets and are being constantly polled for new data on the socket. When the data is finished being read off the socket, an event is fired off to go perform some action such as display a notification on the device.\nTo further explain, the way sockets work is your device makes a connection to a remote server, the remote server pushes data to your device and gets put into the socket's buffer, then your device reads the socket's buffer and does something with the data. The moment the data gets pushed to your device, your device will process it. This is because your device is checking for new data on the socket's buffer all the time. It tries to read data, and if it gets data, it sends it off to get processed and then tries to read data again; if it ever doesn't get data, it just tries to read data again - forever. If the connection to the remote server ever gets disconnected, it just tries to connect again until it succeeds.\nThe code documentation I linked earlier is taken from Boost's ASIO library which is widely used for sockets in C++. It's implementation and usage can be simplified as follows:\n01 start program\n02 try to connect to server by using a socket\n03 if not connected to server, goto 02\n04 try to read data on socket\n05 if data was read, process data\n06 goto 03\n\nIn step 03 above, the device knows when you're offline and won't attempt to connect again until you get back online (the device sends out an event when you connect to the internet, so it will all happen instantly).\nWhen no data was read in step 04 above, it immediately tries to read it again without waiting (assuming you're still connected to the server). It takes a very small amount of processing power to repeatedly try to read data on the socket, so there's no need to worry about battery or wasted resources (see @malhal's answer here for a better explanation on this and also how it works when the device is sleeping).\n\nA: Yes the device CPU is asleep but the cellular modem has another CPU called the baseband processor which keeps running, it monitors for incoming packets that match a certain filter and then wake up the CPU using an interrupt and allows it to process the incoming data. This is trick taken from Microsoft's Pocket PC direct-push, which was an improvement upon Blackberry's implementation that required telco-side BB infrastructure.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create a group of Applications on Dock without changing the path? Now that I have a bunch of applications on my Dock, I want to create a group to manage similar applications altogether. For example, I want to group a set of graphics apps (e.g. Affinity Designer, Sketch 3, Pixelmator) at one place, and access to them by tapping on the group first, and then selecting the app.\nThis can be done if you create a new directory and move the apps to it, and then drag and drop the directory to the Dock. However, this changes the path of the app (e.g. /Applications/Graphics/Pixelmator.app), which I like to eschew. (That's why I called it group, not directory.)\nAlso this has a problem, in that you must drag and drop to the right side of your Dock...\nSo is it still possible to create a group in this case?\n\nA: You can put app aliases to the new folder and then add it do the Dock. You can create an alias by right/secondary clicking on the App and choosing \"Create Alias\" or pressing ⌘ CMD+L.\nMacworld has an article about aliases and putting them on Dock.\n\nAn even easier way to create an alias and move it to your more convenient location is to hold alt (option) and command while clicking and dragging an item. Drop it onto your desktop (or other convenient location) and you've got yourself an alias in the place you need it to be in one swift step.\nYou can find the original item for an alias by selecting the alias and choosing File > Show Original.\n\n\n", "Q: How to enable iCloud on broken iPod My iPod Touch turned off last night and after, it never woke up again. Is there any way to turn on iCloud Photo on this iPod by using my Mac? iCloud is working but not for photos, only for notes.\n\nA: If the device is dead, it's not going to be able to sync anything, even if you could otherwise switch it on remotely. \nYou can switch on photo sync from System Prefs > iCloud for cloud storage, or use iTunes or import using Photos or Image Capture... but all these methods require the device to still be capable of doing that. \n", "Q: Can I import photos from a locked iPhone to Mac? I recently messed up my iPhone and my screen's busted. I can't tap anything, but it'll tap randomly anywhere and everywhere. So I can't type my passcode and I'm trying to get all my photos back through iPhoto but since my phone died and I need to enter my password... I think you get the picture... Anyways, is there any way for me to get my photos back? \n\nA: It will do it without unlocking, unless you've restarted the phone or entered so many incorrect passwords that the phone has locked out any further attempts. \nIf you've restarted it or tried too many times, then you're in about the same position as the FBI in the US right now - in short, no, you can't get it to do anything until it's unlocked.\nYou could try putting another identical phone side by side with it & tapping in the same place on both phones simultaneously, to see if it will accurately recognise the taps; but if that doesn't work [& be careful you don't accidentally lock out the other phone] then the only real solution is to get the screen fixed, or check your iCloud storage - see if they're all already saved online.\n", "Q: How to remove my local Backupdb.backupsdb? On my local harddrive on my MBP retina (2014, 10.11.3) there is a Backupdb.backupsdb folder:\ndrwxr-xr-x+  5 root  wheel   170B  2 Jan 03:32 Backups.backupdb/\nI thought that folder only exists on timemachines?\nHowever, i want to remove it, as it only holds an old unfinished backup: \ndrwxr-xr-x@ 5 root  wheel   170B 20 Mär 14:06 2016-01-02-020746.inProgress/\nI disabled SIP, but neither rm -rf nor sudo rm -rf worked, not even in recovery mode. I always got Operation not permitted.\nDoes anyone know how to delete it?\n\nA: What you are asking is to disable local backups, right? To do that, type this in terminal:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nThe local backups will go away, and so will the space taken up by them (The folder, backups.backupdb)\n\nA: The short answer is remove ACL from the folder. SIP prevents system files from being deleted as root (so enable that again) whereas ACL are used to prevent root from modifying user files and perhaps backup copies of system files.\nHere's how to list the permissions on a specific folder using ls -l which shows long format results:\n\n\n*\n\n*ls -lO shows restricted for SIP and the O is capital letter \"o\" - it's unlikely you will see restricted or other flags on Backups.backupdb \n\n*ls -le shows the Access Control List (ACL) - it's highly likely you have something like 0: group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown causing the sudo rm to fail on you. Use the number (0 in this case) to then remove that ACL restriction.\n\n\nYou can combine both as ls -lOe and get both the ACL and SIP restricted status. As you can read in this post on how malware could potentially unlock Time Machine backups - you can do the same as root/sudo from an admin account:\nchmod -a# 0 /Backups.backupdb\n\nAlso, you might need to recursively remove the ACL since a directory needs to be made changeable and then you can change the files within. Also, ACL can be inherited, so depending on what your exact permissions are on your folder and the files it contains - you might need to change things slightly from the syntax above.\n", "Q: OS X El Capitan Auto Tail Log files So i know i can manually tail files using\ntail -f filename.log\nQuestion\nI would just like to double click any .log files and have them open with Terminal using tail -f\nBackgrounds\ni am a long time windows users, and i have always used baretail but this is my work MAC so i can't just install or download any software would love to use just out of box tricks\nEdits\nNot launching from console but more of like i open the .log and they can open in Terminal itself and then i don't mind just leaving that Terminal or multiple Terminals while i am viewing them \n\nA: There isn't an easy way to change the opener of the files and inject tail.\nHowever, you could make very simple shell scripts and have them open the appropriate commands at log in time:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opening new Terminal.app window/tab with a certain profile from command-line or AppleScript?\nAlso, you can set up several windows and several tabs with different font, color, arrangement (even across multiple Mission Control desktop spaces) and then have terminal open the group. Terminal's help has some tips on both AppleScript automation and using Window Groups (export/import) is possible to edit the xml configuration files for advanced cases.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal via AppleScript\nFor me, I just define aliases that are easy to type in my . initialization scripts.\nalias tf=`tail -F`\nalias tailf='tail -F /var/log/system.log`\nalias upd=`tail -F /var/log/install.log`\nalias mas=`tail -F /var/log/commerce.log`\n\nSo you can tf an arbitrary file or easily kick off specific files of interest rather than scripting a file to run a specific command. It really depends if your brain likes to bring a new window to an existing file or a new file to an existing window.\n\nA: One thing to keep in mind here is that system.log rotates and is compressed periodically. If you have an open tail -f to the file, sooner or later you will notice that no new updates are arriving to it. This is because the system.log file you are pointing to has been deleted, and a new one started. The solution is to ctrl-break and restart the tail. \n", "Q: What is best after a clean install, copying Application Folder or reinstalling all the applications? I have done a clean install but I was wondering if it would make any difference if I just reinstall all my old applications or if I just move my backup applications folder.\n\nA: It really depends on the application, so there is no correct a) or b) solution that would encompass all your apps.\nMany Mac apps are 'installed' by the simple expedient of copying the app from a disk image to the Applications folder.\nSo long as your new install uses the same Apple ID as your old &/or you have any required activation keys, all is good.\nThe issue arises with apps that needed to run as an Installer, asking permissions to modify System items, install background processes etc. For those you will need to correctly re-install.\nI guess empirically, the 'suck it & see' method might be the simplest...\n...copy the Applications folder across, see which ones work...

I have the following mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (27-inch, Late 2013)\n\n*3.4 GHz Intel Core i5\n\n*8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce GTX 775M 2048 MB\n\n\nIt has a HDD, and I have 240GB out of 1TB free space.\nI'm on OS X El Capitan (10.11.3).\nSince some time this mac has been very, very frustratingly slow. It takes about 15 minutes to go from a clean boot to getting firefox up and running. Especially starting applications is painful. It's a bit hard to quantify though, because at other times it seems ok. There's a big perception/psychology part to it.\nI'm considering doing a fresh install, and perhaps go with an older OS X. But I'm also just extremely curious what's causing this. I can't figure it out. I know HDD's are slower, but the machine was fine when I got it, and I find it hard to believe that newer OS X's are so much worse.\nHere's a few things I've done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off time machine, for good measure.\n\n*Turn off dropbox. My dropbox is rather large and I noticed it can be a pretty big factor when it's indexing.\n\n*I don't use FileFault.\n\n*1Password is in the startup items, nothing more.\n\n*I recently did a scan of my disk in recovery mode, to ensure that the disk wasn't failing. S.M.A.R.T. says verified.\n\n\nThere's nothing out of the ordinary in Activity Manager / htop. CPU and Memory both seem reasonable. Also worth mentioning that if I start a game like Starcraft or Cities Skylines, these applications perform pretty well once started. Starting them takes a long time though.\nI'm basically at a loss why my fairly new Mac is worse at running applications as back when I got my first white macbook in 2006, when the applications I'm running haven't changed (firefox, terminal, thunderbird), and Memory quadrupled.\nI'm very comfortable with the command line, and I just want to satisfy my curiosity.

If the below doesn't help, you can take it to an Apple store to run hardware tests.  I've seen instances where faulty sensors, for example, would cause the computer to go into limp mode, and the hard drive was fine.\nHave you tried resetting the PRAM?\nThere are some command line utilities that should be able to pinpoint what's using the disk (if that's the case).  You can try iostat 1 - this will display general disk activity, refreshing every second.  \nTo see more granular info such as the process, use \"fs_fsusage\": sudo fs_usage -f diskio\nI'd first try to narrow down what's eating all the I/O using the above commands.  You can always wipe and reinstall if you want, but if you restore your entire Time Machine backup, you'll be potentially re-introducing the problem.  So I'd say only restore your data/ user account w/o the ~/Library folder if possible.\nOn the hardware side of things, these devices shipped with at least 7200 RPM drives.  While much better than the slower 5400, modern OSes will still choke with excessive disk activity (spotlight, time machine, various system services).  \nReplacing the drive with an SSD on your own IS possible but you need tools, and have to be very careful handling the screen.  So if you've never done it before I'd recommend paying someone to do.\nEDIT: Also check your system log in Console... look for disk i/o errors\n\nA: I know this is kind of a blunt comment, but after seeing your Mac specs, you really really should buy an SSD.\n   If there is no other real problem (maybe there is) that is the single most obvious bottleneck I can see. ssds are fairly cheap now, so u can get a 250gb for well under 100$, and the hdd is easy to clone+ install, and your Mac will feel (and maybe be)5x as fast. \n   If u still have warranty up u might have to pay a cert. Mac Tech tho.\n\nA: I ended up doing more searching myself, and came with a different solution.\nSince CPU usage was fairly low, I figured it had to do with HD access. I used a combination of iotop and fs_usage to figure out who was doing what.\nTurns out that Spotlight-related processes are pretty much busy all the time. That, and app store-related processes.\nFor now I killed the app store stuff, and added a lot of directories to the Spotlight exclude list. I pretty much just use Spotlight for launching applications, so I can probably live without it for the most part.\nI'm going to see how this is going for a while. If it turns out that this solution is 100% fool-proof I'm closing this ticket, and the end of ~2 years frustration with crappy Apple engineering. But I'm waiting a bit, don't want jump the gun.\n\nA: Running down \"my computer is slow\" problems is what keep IT & computer repair people in business as it is tough to narrow down.\nBefore doing much else I would be tempted to clone your HD to an external drive and then unplug it. Nothing like a well meaning maintenance routine doing something unexpected and hosing some (or all) of your data.\nNot sure that zapping the PRAM is going to help with slowness issues, then again it can't hurt and only takes a few minutes, or in your case about 15.\nI would run one of the maintenance utilities like Onyx or such. Go to the Automate tab, check all the boxes and let it do it's thing. Reboot when it is done and see what happens.\nI would also boot into recovery mode and run Disk Utility and click on the drive and then repair to verify there really is nothing wrong with the drive.\nIf all of that does not work I would make sure you have a clone of your drive standing by, wipe the internal and reinstall the OS fresh. If it then boots up and is faster use the Migration Utility to copy your files and settings. I would be hesitant to copy the apps over as something there might have caused the problem (assuming migrating your settings didn't slow things down, then it is likely a preference file that is damaged or is putting the Mac in a strange state.)\nFailing all of that then your choices boil down to an older OS that is not so resource intensive or a new SSD. El Cap. really does use all of the resources on a Mac: Memory & Storage to it's fullest so if it is choking a little on memory or utilizing the drive a lot those are potential slow downs and a faster SSD or more memory may indeed help the situation.\nI have an older iMac with El Cap. and finally (because I didn't want to go through opening it up --what a mess--) I added an external Firewire 2 drive which helped the performance quite a bit. But internal gives you the best performance, your choice.\n", "Q: message: drag dmg file to applications folder keeps repeating I have downloaded stellarphoenixmacdatarecovery.dmg file.

I own a 2011 21,5\" iMac, and I need to install Windows to run some software that is Windows only.\nI have done this in the past by altering Bootcamp assistent so it can use bootable USB drives, which is not natively supported on the 2011 iMac. (as explained here)\nNow lately I reinstalled my iMac, so I wanted to modify Boot Camp again. As it turns out Apple 'fixed' this workaround by making bootcamps internal files not editable anymore.\nSo after I realized I couldn't use a USB drive, I tried using a bootable DVD, this didn't work, since Boot Camp gave me the message that \"There is no bootable USB drive installed\". \nIn other words, Boot camp thinks it needs a bootable usb drive, when those aren't supported on my model.\nSo my question; does anyone know a way to work around this 'fix'?\n\nA: Boot Camp Assistant.app - among other apps in the Utilities folder - is protected by System Integrity Protection as outlined here.\nBy disabling SIP you will be able to edit the info.plist again.\nSo boot to Recovery Mode by pressing cmdR while booting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app (menubar -> Utilites -> Terminal)\n\n*Enter csrutil disable\n\n*Reboot your Mac \n\n*Edit the file /Applications/Utilities/Boot Camp Assistant.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\n*Reboot again to Recovery Mode and enable SIP again: csrutil enable\n\n*Reboot your Mac\n\n\n\nYou should also be able to edit the file directly after booting to Recovery Mode without disabling SIP:\n/Volumes/name_of_main_volume/usr/bin/nano /Volumes/name_of_main_volume/Applications/Utilities/Boot\\ Camp\\ Assistant.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\nYou'd have to make notes how and what to add though because you may have no real internet access.\n\nEven if you can create a USB Windows installer, this does not necessarily mean that you can boot your Mac to Windows using this flash drive.\n\nA: I have a version of the Modified Boot Camp Assistant that I made.

Others have suggested converting the image into a high-resolution raster image first, e.g. here and on the Microsoft support forums. However, none of the workarounds will keep the inserted image as a vector-based figure (which has many advantages over a raster-based image, e.g. you can select and search text). My workaround is to save the PowerPoint as a PDF after inserting the image. In that way, you can keep the image in a vector-based image. Does anyone know of a better solution?\nI’m a Mac user, so I’d be more interested in a Mac solution here. \n\nA: PowerPoint 2011 and 2016 don't retain vector graphics from PDF files, but merrily convert everything into bitmap graphics when the presentation is saved. To embed vector graphics in the presentation file, it's necessary to use an .EMF or .WMF file (Enhanced Metafile / Windows Metafile) instead of PDF. These  are Microsoft's own portable graphics formats from the Windows world and can contain bitmap elements and vector elements. The EMF format is preferable over its older version WMF because EMF supports vector graphics better.\nTo embed vector graphics from a PDF file, the PDF file will need to be converted to an EMF file, but if possible, it would be preferable to use an EMF file exported directly from the software that was used to create the graphics in the first place. Vector graphics editors like Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape as well as OpenOffice Draw all can export .EMF files. (Affinity Designer currently not so.) The possible downside is that more complex graphics and effects from advanced applications like Illustrator may be rendered wrong in the EMF format, which then makes it necessary to convert the vector graphics into bitmap graphics after all. \nFor conversion, there are commercially sold utilities and free websites. There are also tools to convert PDF files directly to PowerPoint presentations (.pptx files), but I'm not sure about the quality of these solutions, e.g., they might just convert the vector graphics into bitmap graphics...\nUsing vector graphics applications for export or conversion:\n• Adobe Illustrator can export to EMF format. So if AI is at hand, this is the tool of choice: Open the PDF file (or the original .AI file) in Illustrator and choose File > Export…, then choose \"Enhanced Metafile (emf)\" from the format selection in the dialog box.\n• Inkscape (open source software) can export to the EMF format (File > Save As…), and placing the these files in PowerPoint seems to work fine. But when importing and re-exporting existing PDFs with complex graphics, e.g., from Illustrator, the result may differ from the original.\nWikipedia has a comparison of vector graphics applications with their export formats.\n\nIf this is all too much trouble and you want to keep at least a high-resolution bitmap image, the best workaround is to convert the PDF into a high-resolution image yourself, e.g., by using the Preview application to open and export the PDF as PNG. (Beware: Depending on the source of the PDF file, it may contain low-resolution bitmap graphics, which can not be 'upscaled' without visible pixelation.) \nAfter placing the image, it's important to adjust PowerPoint's automatic image compression setting before you save the presentation: Choose File > Reduce File Size, and in the dialog box select \"Keep Current Resolution\"from the drop-down menu.\n\nA: Actually, after investigating different solutions, I found that EPS (also a vector-based format) works perfectly in Mac Powerpoint 2011 (I've not tried MS Word yet, but I guess it will work, too). If you convert PDF to EPS and insert it into powerpoint as a picture, it will keep crystal clear and infinite resolution :D The only caveat is the EPS file is usually ~1.5 fold larger than PDF. It worths to give a try if you are picky with the resolution like me :)\n\nA: Mac & Powerpoint users forget about everything. Just copy/paste each layer/graphic from the original vector graphics application to powerpoint (use several slides to ease your work), one by one, and then unite them. In this way you can create an animated logo for instance, easily. But be aware that you must use \"screen recording\" in quick time player, and than simply trim the video.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open PDF in PDF-XChange Editor\n\n*Right Click on the drawing\n\n*Choose \"Export Selection to PowerPoint\"\n\n\nThis exports beautifully to PowerPoint, AND the vector drawing is fully editable afterwards in PowerPoint! Change line widths or colors, add or delete lines etc. pp...\nSide note: editing the drawing afterwards in PowerPoint will only work when a valid license for PDF-XChange Editor is present. Otherwise the *.ppt file will be read only.\n\nA: Open PDF in Illustrator. Save the PDF from Illustrator as SVG. That imports well into PowerPoint, and scales very well in PowerPoint. There are options for the font too when saving to the SVG.\n\nA: As of macOS 10.12.6 and MS Powerpoint 2016, it appears that direct drag-and-drop a PDF to a slide will make it shown as a vector image and stored in EMF format (if you unzip the .pptx as a .zip file you will see the inserted image as an .emf).\n\nA: I narrowed it down to problems with gradients and transparencies. I found two workarounds. 1. create an EPS file with each image saved separately (irritating when I have a lot of images that I want to copy and paste into Powerpoint). Use Insert Picture into Powerpoint and it holds as vector after closing and reopening. The madness is having Powerpoint say the file is saved with your beautiful artwork displayed and reopening the file and it's changed. 2. Eliminate transparencies. This worked an image that had a lot of radial gradient fills. However, I have a linear gradient fill on a stroke in Illustrator that bitmaps on closing. I believe there is some type of transparency built into the gradients in Illustrator so it may come down to an inability to convert transparencies into WMF.  None of this excuses making changes without notifying the user.\n", "Q: How would I identify what's causing my Mac to permanently hang on shutdown? Whenever I try to shutdown or reboot my Mac (Macbook Pro 15\" Retina late 2013, OS X 10.11.3) it closes all programs like normal and then it goes into that black screen with the progress bar. When it gets to about halfway it permanently hangs and won't ever finish rebooting. I looked at the log viewer and couldn't find anything in particular. Is there a way to monitor a shutdown more closely and find out what's causing it to get stuck?\n\nA: My first response whenever something is broken in Mac OS X is to try a safe boot. Safe boots perform several repair tasks in addition to safe booting your mac without extensions or startup items running.\nShut down your Mac. Power it up and begin holding down the shift key the moment you hear the startup chime. Keep it down until you see an onscreen progress bar. Eventually, you will get a login screen - Login and wait until your machine is fully started up. Now restart normally and see if problem is fixed.\n\nA: I would recommend starting your Mac in Verbose Mode.\nWhen you startup and shutdown you will see the Console entries in realtime on the screen.\nSometimes you can see what the computer is getting stuck on at shutdown.

The effect is the same if it's loading at this moment or it has 100% or 15%.\nA crash starts by a freeze. Nothing works, after 1-2 minutes the freeze changes to black background and an dark-grey apple. Then the apple changes to the \"standard\"-colored (brighter) apple. After some minutes the iPad has restarted. But this is no guarantee that it runs now without a new crash.\nHope anyone has an idea to solve this problem.\n\nA: Have you tried restoring it? There could be something app or service running that you are not aware of, thats causing it.\nI would try doing that.\nRestore to new, and install a couple of app and test it for a day or two to see if it still crashes.\nBefore you do, take a full backup to your computer!\nIf that doesn't work, you probably need to have it looked at by a pro.\n", "Q: How to prevent automount of a partition in El Capitan There are two boot partitions on my MacBook.

Occasionally I’d like to connect to my home computer from my work computer. Both run Yosemite. \nI’d like to do this using Remote Desktop, as in I’d like to be able to run all programs on my home computer as if I was sitting behind it (view my Desktop, and access and run all my apps)\nAt work most outgoing connections are blocked. Can I get around this by using a paid VPN service whenever I want to connect to home? I have no experience with VPNs but do understand the concept and since I have admin rights on my machine I must be able to set one up.\nOnce the VPN is up and running I guess I can use any Remote Desktop app to connect to home?\nThen the next question is that I probably need a fixed IP address or hostname at home, since I’m on a residential DSL connection that periodically changes IP. Would DynDNS help me with that? I see that Dyn also has a Remote Access product - would that let me see my desktop and run apps, or only access my files?\nCan anyone confirm if this general overview is correct and possibly recommend a good VPN service and remote desktop app for this type of scenario? \n\nI don't want to use iCloud!\n\nA: I have personally used TeamViewer.\n\n\n*\n\n*No need for a VPN or DDNS\n\n*Free for Personal Use\n\n*Works on Mac, Windows, Linux, Andrioid, etc.\n\n*Substantially faster than VNC\n\n\nWith a VPN, you run into the issue of it either being blocked by your company's firewall or if it is a SSL VPN, you either have to pay for the service or spend a lot of time and effort setting it up - it's quite complex and not something that is baked into consumer grade routers.\nDDNS or Dynamic DNS can be done quite easily and it's fairly cheap, but it's not required.\nI have found that TeamViewer performs much faster than VNC which is choppy and lags quite a bit over remote connections.  It also dosen't have all the hassles associated with VPN connectivity and there is even a USB version that you can run without having to install (meaning you can put TeamViewer on a USB stick and run it from any computer with Internet)\n", "Q: How to uninstall Jetbrains IDE?

Apple Developer and EV Certificate? My employer plans to distribute Mac OSX software outside the App Store through their website. Do I need to get an organizational developer ID from Apple ($99 USD/yr) plus purchase an EV code-signing certificate from Symantec? Or, will the Apple Dev ID certificate work just fine? I'm confused -- what's the process? And if you could also show what we do at command line or XCode, that would help, too.\nSee, I'm used to distributing on Windows. On Windows, we just get an EV cert from Symantec to sign the product. By doing the expensive EV cert, it gets past the web browser filters without warning eventually, given enough downloads from different IP addresses.\nApple states the following, but it's clear as mud (no surprise there, given that this is Apple documentation) because it doesn't explain if I don't need to sign with both certs or just one (if that's even possible to sign with two certs).\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html\nOn that page, it states:\n\nNote: Apple uses the industry-standard form and format of code signing\n  certificates. Therefore, if your company already has a third-party\n  signing identity that you use to sign code on other systems, you can\n  use it with the OS X codesign command.\n\n\nA: Here is what the Apple Documentation says about this in the Developer ID section: \"You can distribute your Mac applications outside of the Mac App Store by using Developer ID.

Nothing responds and I need to force shutdown to be able to reboot. \nThose are the things I already tried :\n- rebooting in safe mode : desktop icons will appear, but everything freezes after a couple of seconds.

Since some days, it seems to be impossible to open both WhatsApp and (Facebook) Messenger. For both of them, the following applies.\n\n\n*\n\n*On the home view with all the apps, you can see that there are new messages. But if you open the app, it shows for 1 second, then the screen goes white, and then the home view with all the apps shows again.\n\n*After double-clicking on the button (in order to reveal the miniature view of all apps opened), you can see that the app is indeed opened, but if you click on its miniature view, you will again see the scenario with the white screen.\n\n\nWhat could cause this and how can she solve it?\n\nA: Because of the closed nature of IOS, there really are no troubleshooting steps that can be taken, besides deleting app/reinstalling, or wiping the device, setting up as 'new' device, and then trying again.\nUnfortunately, though the apps list IOS 7+ and 6+ as requirements in the app store, I have seen this behavior on older iPhones (namely my GF's) and the 'fix' has been to update IOS to a newer version.  Though this is not technically a 'fix', as the apps SHOULD work with 8.1.3, it does (for my GF at least) 'solve' the issue.  \nOf course, your first step should be deleting the apps and then re-installing them from the app store as I mentioned above.\nIf that doesn't work, and if you have performed a backup of the phone (either to iCloud or iTunes), you can try simply resetting the phone to factory defaults (keeping IOS at the same version), setting the iPhone up as a 'new' device, and then try to install the apps to see if they work.  If they don't, then you have your answer.  If they DO work, then you can reset the phone once again, restore your backup and hope for the best.\nIf this STILL doesn't work, you may try to update the IOS version, either via iTunes or the phone's native Over-The-Air update process, but the latter requires there be enough free space on the phone to download the update TO the phone.  Of course, make sure to take a backup first.\nAt the end of the day, I have personally had to just bit the bullet and start all over, setting the iPhone up as a 'new' device, and NOT restoring from a backup, in order to resolve some issues.  If you elect to take this route, make sure you have your data backed up/saved elsewhere, OUTSIDE of the iPhone backup.  Alternatively, you can use third-party software like PhoneView, iExplorer or iBackupBot to retrieve data from iTunes backups.    \nTo reset phone to factory defaults (only do this after you have taken a backup): Settings>General>Reset (at the bottom) > Erase All Content and Settings.\n", "Q: I'm Getting Errors When I Try to do 'brew update' I want to install a gem.

Intensive processes see the fan speeds go up to 6200.\nFor temperatures, idle activity should have temperatures at 40-50 ºC (CPU PECI die) and 30 ºC for air flow proximity.\nIf your fans get really loud and noisy, it may be a sign that your fans are malfunctioning or there could be some form of obstruction that causes noise when air runs over it.

After speaking with a senior advisor at Apple, I have been informed by them that the Night Shift feature (and other iOS features in the 9.3 upgrade) are not available for Ipod touch 5th generation, which is frustrating, as there seems to be no available alternative.\nI used to have a great app on my Ipod called F.LUX (which as only available if I jailbroke the Ipod).

As referenced in this comment, Apple doesn't remove features without a significant reason, but other 3rd party apps like f.lux and GammaTool can do colour changes on 32-bit devices just fine. What are possible reasons Apple might not have been able to do this?\n\nA: The simplest explanation could be one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simple limited resources - finite time to QA and test. This is always something to consider - for each device that runs code, you need to provide devices to the coders, test during development, test during QA, support over the 2-3 year period that OS will be under mainstream support, etc... Basically, technically feasible features lie strewn across the cutting room floor all the time due to the fact that resources are not infinite, timelines exist, and budgets exist.\n\n*The framework Apple uses to implement this simply doesn't support or hasn't been written for the older hardware. Yes - you can write code in the basic 1+1=2 for just about any chipset or framework. My educated guess is night shift is written in metal or a lower level API. Apple's documentation explains the hardware needed to support metal and OpenGLES v 3.0:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/OpenGLESPlatforms/OpenGLESPlatforms.html\nIf you look at all the OpenGL2.0 and non-metal devices that now don't support night-shift it might be a compelling technical reason to not ship that feature without the metal/3.0 capabilities of the graphics API and hardware support to back up what the code describes.\nMy hunch is solidly in Hardware + API limitation camp, but it's worth stating that there is a large cost to every change and every decision in the iOS ecosystem at this point with most of the 1 billion active users of Apple products being iOS users.\n", "Q: Does the smart cover keyboard on the iPad Pro have any features that a bluetooth keyboard wouldn't? If you buy either model of the iPad Pro, you have the option of using the smart-cover keyboard. \nAside from the fact that the smart keyboard draws its power from the iPad Pro (using special contacts for that purpose), are there any other additional features that couldn't be done using one of the many bluetooth keyboards designed for tablets? \nI don't see any special keys on the smartcover keyboard, which leads me to believe the answer to this question is a simple: No.\n\nA: Well the keyboard does act as a stand, you get a folding triangle bit at the back and it holds the iPad at 45 degrees, so you can stick it on your desk and type away. The bit in contact with the desk is like felt, so the whole thing doesn't slide around. There is also a magnetic grip/strip that keeps the keyboard secure when its in the stand, so again it doesn't slide around. It all feels very secure and connected.\nThe keyboard also opens out completely and folds over the iPad and acts as cover for when you're carrying it around, so the screen is protected from scratches and other knocks. In this mode the keyboard has a small magnetic contact that switches the iPad off when you close the cover and wakes the iPad up when you open it back up.\nAlso the keyboard draws power only when you hit the keys, so doesn't put a drain on the battery quite like running bluetooth does.\nIts also smart enough (because of the connector) to understand that pressing CMD + TAB together means switch between apps like you get on a desktop\nSo the keyboard really acts as a keyboard, stand, anti-slip device, scratch protection, screen cover, better battery, CMD+TAB  and 'go to sleep/wake' combination device.\n", "Q: Contact names are gone, but still shown in Messages My iPhone 6's contact names are gone, but the numbers are still there.\nHowever when I go to messaging and add a new message and type for a contact by name, all the contacts show up with both the name and the message. Therefore I know that the iPhone still has the names stored somewhere, because it shows up when searching in the messaging search.\nWhat can I do to get all my contact names back, because I know that they are stored somewhere.\nI don't have any backups, but I shouldn't need any, because my device seems to have the contact names somewhere, as I see them when I add a message and search.\n\nA: Try these possible fixes :\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > iCloud > toggle Contacts on and off\n\n\nThe Second fix only applies if you have multiple email accounts synced with your iPhone (iCloud,Gmail etc) :\n\n\n*Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Gmail or whichever you use > toggle Contacts on and off \n\n\nAlso check the Default Account in Settings to see which email account is selected.\n\nA: This happened to me. I had deleted my gmail account because it was taking up too much space. I remembered the changes I made before the contact names deleted. I restored the account and my contact names were restored. Then I imported the contacts to sim from gmail and cloud so they would save. \n", "Q: How can I analyse Others data in my iPhone? My iPhone 5s currently running on iOS 9.2 has been misbehaving for a couple of months now. No matter, how much free space I give it, it slows eat it away, reducing MB by MB till I have 0 bytes free space left.\nEven if I don't use the phone, it stills eat away the free space. My suspect is that an app is writing logs like a maniac. I tried syncing with iTunes thinking it might be the debug logs that gets sent for crashes etc, but it's not that either.\nHow do I go about getting an idea on what makes up this other data? If I know its an app (I am thinking Whatsapp since its a chat app and the only thing on my phone that keeps on running all the time), I can get rid of it.\n\nA: Whatsapp might be causing the problem.delete it but if you want to backup your whatsapp contents,see if you can do that with Whatsapp itself beforehand.after removing whatsapp check the memory size and then re-install the app.\n", "Q: Access Mac App Store via VPN I am pretty new to Macs, but I am not sure that is relevant here. I do use a VPN sometimes (and will do so more). It seems to work OK for browsers, email etc as it should.\nHowever, I wanted to change my location on the App Store. The reason is legitimate: A software vendor is only selling via the App Store, but is charging extra (ie ripping off) customers in my country. It is legal to get around the discriminatory pricing here with a VPN, proxy etc.\nBut the new \"location\" doesn't seem to work for the App Store, which apparently has me where I actually am, hence I have to pay the ripoff price in the local currency. Is there any way around this? Am I missing something obvious?\nIt is enough money to make some difference, but the principle is also important.\n\nA: The App Store does not care about your physical location, you can shop in any country's app store from any other country. To change stores, just click the flag icon at the bottom of any page. \nYour main problem will be that to purchase from any country's app store, you need to use an Apple ID that has a valid billing address in that country.\n\nA: As far as I know, on the App Store the purchase is available on the market where your Apple ID is registered. I mean, if the App Store sees that your location is US, it will switch you to the US market automatically. The only way to bypass paying extra money is to create a new Apple ID using the location where this app costs less. \n", "Q: Unable to get iOS 9.3 update OTA iOS 9.3 was released yesterday, so I wanted it on my iPhone 5s. However when I try to open Settings → General → Software Update, it pops up with a message:\n\nUnable to Check for Update, an error occurred while checking for a software update.\n\nI tried several things found on the internet like resetting the network settings, changing the DNS, switching to cellular network, but I am still getting the same error.\nHow can I download iOS 9.3 OTA?\n\nA: Usually the first 24 hours are the hardest. Since the servers are busy pushing out the update for millions of devices.\nIf it doesn't work after that, you might have to go for the update via iTunes.\n", "Q: How do I use spell check in OSX with several languages? I often need to write emails in French that contain English technical words and it seems that the spell check in OSX can't understand that a document can contain both languages. \nThe result is either French or English words are red-underlined and this isn't pretty. \nI've tried the trick on How to make Firefox to spellcheck in multiple languages simultaneously? that consists in merging several .dic and .aff files downloaded from titoBouzout/Dictionaries but the grammar check is less precise than the default OSX one. \n\nA: Go to system preferences/keyboard/text/spelling and click on the window and go to the Setup item.  Then check the boxes for only the two languages you want and set it to Automatic.  Also set the dictionary to Automatic in Edit > Spelling and Grammar > Show Spelling and Grammar.\nI suspect this works better for separate sentences or paragraphs in different languages than for different languages in one sentence. \n\nA: Try this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go into System Preferences / Language and Region and set French as Primary language under Preferred languages.\n\n*Restart the computer.\n\n*Set back you previous primary language (by dragging it from the Preferred languages list to the top).\n\n*Restart. \n\n\nI just tried this, and even after deleting French from my Preferred languages it kept correctly correcting French words.\nI'm not entirely sure why, but it seem to do the trick.\n\nA: Tom Gewecke's solution mostly worked for me, but I had to add a secondary source in Keyboard -> Input sources. Then it worked as expected.\n", "Q: When apple replaces the battery in a 15\" MBP retina, do they replace the entire top portion of the case? Apple's site says it is $199 to replace the battery.   Do the techs replace the entire top portion of the case including  the keyboard and trackpad?   I've read a few things on the internet alluding to that since the battery is glued in, they replace the entire assembly.   \nJust wondering if this includes the keyboard and track pad.   (I think it must include the keyboard since it is riveted in).  I'm wondering specifically about the trackpad, since mine has been flaky for a while, and now battery is about due for replacement. \nMine is a mid 2012 macbook pro retina.\nUpdate:  Had this done, and for the low price of $199 I got a new keyboard, trackpad and topcase as part of the deal, as expected.   I can't believe how worn out my old keyboard was!\n\nA: The battery is glued to the top part.  In the Apple's internal instruction to employees, it is strongly advised not to attempt separating the battery from the top case.  Your entire top case will be replaced, which includes the battery, the keyboard, and the track pad.\n\nA: It appears to be the case that Apple will replace the top case assembly if you want to replace your battery.\n\nAs first reported by Treehugger, which received a copy of an Apple internal service document for the \"Mid-2012\" 15-Inch Retina Display MacBook Pro, Apple informs its own service personnel that \"batteries must be replaced with the top case assembly\" and that \"the battery alone is not a replaceable part.\" EveryMac.com also has been provided with copies of the internal service documents for subsequent 15-Inch Retina Display MacBook Pro models and although there are internal differences, the battery design effectively is the same.\nAdditionally, Apple warns its own technicians that \"batteries should\n  not be separated from the top case assembly for any reason,\" as\n  attempting to do so could puncture the battery and lead to fire or\n  injury. Do not attempt to pry the battery apart from the top case.\n\nSource:  EveryMac.com\nAccording to iFixit, it will cost local repair shops around $500 to source the top case assembly to replace the battery.  \nIFixit.com also has instructions on how to remove this battery should you want to replace it.  Batteries with a minimum of 12 month warranties can be had for $90USD makes this a worthwhile consideration.  Keep in mind that this is a difficult repair and if you are unsure of your ability to tackle something like this, best hand it over to a pro.\n\nA: There wouldn't be a need to replace the keyboard and trackpad unless during the battery replacement they damage it.\nCheck out this iFixit guide to see how they remove the battery\n", "Q: Removing XCode while keeping the command line tools (on El Capitan) As by subject.  There are a number of links, such as this that deal with the issue but are not El Capitan specific and/or are just not that on the subject or are not up to date.  \nIs it possible to Uninstall XCode 7 while keeping the Command Line Tools (and still being able to get the CLT upgrades)? Should I just uninstall everything and reinstall just the CLT (how?)?\nAny other way?\n\nA: Personally, I think that instead of trying to \"bodge\" a method of uninstalling Xcode while leaving CLT intact is too cumbersome.  My suggestion is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall Xcode completely\n\n*Install Xcode CLT\n\n\nDoing this should take you less than 5 minutes total and is quite simple.\n\nUninstall Xcode\nThere are a number of different ways to uninstall Xcode.  An excellent tutorial can be found at OSXDaily.\nHowever, the most reliable way I have found to uninstall software is with the free app recommended by Macworld.com called AppCleaner.  You can \"drag and drop\" or \"Search\" for your apps that you want to remove and it will find all related files/directories for you - even the ones that get installed as launch daemons.  \nDisclaimer:  I am not affiliated with the app or the developers of the app in any way. \nInstall Xcode CLT (Yosemite through Sierra)\nInstalling Xcode CLT is actually quite simple.  In Terminal, execute the following command:\nxcode-select --install\n\nYou will get a dialog box that will prompt you to \"Get Xcode,\" \"Cancel,\" or \"Install.\"  Select \"Install\" to install the CLT only.\n\nThe installer will do its thing and will notify you once it's complete.  Once finished, you will have access to tools such as git and svn.  You can execute those commands by testing them out in Terminal.\nCLT will be installed to /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/\nThat's it!  Xcode CLT are installed and ready for use.\n\nA: Monterey: uninstall Xcode, re-install CLI tools\nUpdate: I just upgraded my MacBook Air to Monterey (took ages) then used Homebrew to install the apps I use. Running brew doctor warned of outdated Xcode. Read up, realised I only need Xcode to develop Apple apps (which I don’t do) but need the CLI tools. Did the following after reading through this and many other posts:\n\n*\n\n*brew install --cask appcleaner (I've used AppCleaner many times before)\n\n*remove Xcode by dragging the Xcode app from Applications to AppCleaner and deleting all finds in one go via AppCleaner\n\n*run brew doctor, which highlighted that there were now no CLI tools\n\n*followed Homebrew message to xcode-select --install\nAll fine, thanks to some of the advice above.\n", "Q: xpcproxy using all my bandwidth I have recently installed an SSD in my iMac and restored my backup using SuperDuper!. Since then, xpcproxy seems to randomly download stuff and uses all my bandwidth for minutes on end. What would be the reason?\nI am running the latest version of El Capitan (yesterday's update).\n\nA: Here is how I found out which app was causing all this bandwidth:\n(I was downloading roughly 300k)\nI started Wireshark for a couple of seconds. Then sorted the resulting list by source ip. Now I looked which ip was listed most often (therefore sending the most traffic to me).\nThat got me an IP address which I looked up who owns it: https://db-ip.com/all/162.222.43\nTurns out the address was owned by CrashPlan. So I fired up CrashPlan and saw that is was doing some synchronisation.\n\nA: I've also observed it running on Yosemite. As for what xpcproxy actually is, it's part of the OS X anti-malware software, according to this Apple forum post, which also warns not to mess with system processes such as this.\n\nA: In my case, it was nsurlsessiond (by sudo lsof | grep -i nsurl)\nFired up Charles with https MITM'ing, but didn't find anything talking to Apple (but it wasn't making any new connections to intercept).\nIt seemed to go away after a little while.\nEDIT: After sleeping and waking it up with Charles running, xpcproxy showed it was downloading pictures from iCloud ([redacted].icloud-content.com).\n(xpc services need some better monitoring tools and/or they're not well-known.)\n", "Q: restoring ipod touch forces update I have been trying to restore my 5th Generation Ipod touch from a backup which is stored on my computer. The restore process works fine, however after its' completion there is a white screen lock with a SLIDE TO UPGRADE option that prevents me from using the Ipod, unless I upgrade.  \nSince I do not wish to upgrade the software on the Ipod from the currently installed iOS version (9.2.1), is there some way to circumvent this lockout by Apple?\n\nA: The \"slide to upgrade\" screen doesn't update your iOS firmware; it simply prepares your backup for iOS 9.\n", "Q: ipad 2 not opening Yesterday I did an update on IOS that was available in my iPad 2 (I think it was 9.3.2).

What I'm wondering is, why is Night Shift not available for my phone? Is it the architecture of the processor, something to do with the screen, or perhaps something else?\n\nA: You can install F.lux instead using xcode. It's not very complicated and it doesn't require you to jailbreak your phone at all and it's not a hack : https://justgetflux.com/sideload/ You'll just have to download the project file from another website as they've deleted it following apple's demand to take it down. It works nicely on my 5C.\n\nA: From Apple site:\n\nNight Shift is available on iPhone 5s or later, iPad Pro, iPad Air or later, iPad mini 2 or later, and iPod touch (6th generation).\n\nSo I think It's related to 64bit processor architecture.\n\nA: I might guess, based on insight from being a software developer: The f.lux page says that it is no longer available because it doesn't use the documented API and Apple doesn't like them getting around it. The new Night Shift feature is part of a new iOS release, so it must use a newly added API feature.  That feature may be added for current devices only and it would be different to implement on older devices, and they did not put that work into it because it's obsolecent.\n", "Q: How can I install template from 3rd party to Keynote? After downloading a template for my Keynote program, I can't seem to install it correctly so that I can utilize the 200+ slides that are included when I wish to add a new slide in the presentation.\nI have the latest software of El Capitan and the latest version of Keynote installed.\nThis is what I have done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchased \"Eureka - Minimal Keynote Template\" from this site (http://graphicriver.net/item/eureka-minimal-keynote-template/15099332) and downloaded files.\n\n*Folder downloaded is split up into different sub folders: 1 Documentation, 2 Presentation, 3 Vector Icons, 4 Double Exposure PSD. \nFrom folder 2 there are two files named Eureka - 16x9 - MAIN.key and when opening them in Keynote, on the left sidebar 200+ slides are displayed (these are all the slide templates that I wish to utilize when creating new presentations). \n\n*So I choose \"Save Theme\" and add it to the \"Theme Chooser\", but when opening it from the \"Theme Chooser\" I only get the two master slides - one white and one black\" to choose from when clicking \"add slide\".\n\n*So I go back and check the Eureka - 16x9 - MAIN.key that I first opened, and see that when clicking \"add slide\" in this one, I also only have the two options of the black and the white slide here.\n\nSo this is where I am puzzled - should not the template I have purchased when saved give me the opportunity of finding all the 200+ template slides in the slide navigator when I click \"add slide\"? This is what I want - so I can choose between the 200+ of them when creating a new presentation based on the template. So how can I do this?\nDo I have to save all the 200+ slides as master slides, and if so how do I do this?\nOr are there another solution?\nI have been googling for hours now, and all I can seem to find are that I have to add the downloaded file to /library/application support/Keynote/templates , but there are no /keynote/templates to be found in my library.\n\nA: The specific location where the files are stored is:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iWork.Keynote/Data/Library/Application Support/User Templates\nOR\nYou can just use the Save Theme > Add Theme to Chooser option to achieve the same result.\n\nHowever, you will need to add the missing slides to your set of Master Slides manually. \nAdding New Master Slides\nTo do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to a unique slide that came with the theme and copy the unique elements\n\n*Under View, Select Edit Master Slides\n\n*Make sure you can view the Navigator on the left\n\n*Right-click (two-finger click) over the Navigator and make a new Master Slide \n\n*On the new Master Slide - clear out any default elements if it's not blank\n\n*Paste the unique elements from the slide copied into step #1\n\n*Rename the new master slide to something memorable about the content\n\n*Exit the master slide editor (Done button)\n(Repeat for as many slides that you want to use with the template)\n\n\nWhen finished you should be able to save and use the updated Keynote template normally. \nKeynote used: version 8.0.1 (5579)\n\nMissing fonts - Lots of 3rd party templates come without the fonts.\n  You'll need to install these or choose substitutes and then reboot to\n  have Keynote recognize all the fonts.\n\n", "Q: How to disable Xcode's '\"ProjectName\" is a project downloaded from the Internet.

Using the El Capitan Contacts app, I was able to drag and drop several contacts from an Outlook account to a Google account. However, there is one contact that I am unable to drag and drop.

I recently got a MacBook Pro. Its hard drive is completely empty. So every time I hit cmdR it goes to the internet recovery mode and takes hours to download data recovery. However, when I restart my system, every downloaded data seems to disappear, and it re-downloads recovery mode data. Does anybody know how can I make recovery drive permanent?\n\nA: Booting to Internet Recovery Mode boots directly to a netboot image provided by Apple/Akamai servers. The netboot image is a stripped down OS X version which only provides some diagnostic tools and a tool to either restore OS X or a Time Machine backup. The downloaded OS is completely loaded to RAM and nothing is written to hard disks.\nAfter shutting down/rebooting the Mac the RAM is wiped and everything has to be downloaded again if you want to start to Recovery Mode a second time.\nTo create a Recovery HD on your Mac you have to install OS X (Restore OS X). While downloading and installing OS X a recovery partition will be built also.\nAnother option is to set up a Mac running Server.app and enable caching services. That will keep a copy of the recovery image locally in cache and speed up the download - perhaps 100x as fast if you have a gigabit speed network locally.\n", "Q: Problem with scripted account deletion syntax I'm working on an account cleanup script module that can handle the hidden and unhidden accounts we're creating in bulk on new MacOS systems.\nWe've kept the logic simple to start.\nHowever I keep getting an error: line 4: [: missing `]'\nI have the space...what am I missing?

So I went to the manufacturer's site and looked to see if they had Mac drivers, and I did find some. However, upon installing them, the printer still fails to even show up in the Add Printer window whether I connected it via USB or Ethernet. So I decided to use Wine to use the Printer Service Utility (only for Windows) to see if it's being detected at all, which it isn't. There isn't an available PC to use, so I've been trying to find a appropriate Windows emulator that has driver support. I should be able to get my hands on a Windows installation disc if I need to. Answers or links would be very much appreciated.\n\nA: As far as getting PC emulator, why not take a look at VirtualBox?\nWith VBox, you can create a \"workstation\" that exists on your network (bridged connection) then load the native printer drivers.  If you are able to get it working there, you can do two thing:\n\n\n*\n\n*verify that the printer is working\n\n*share the printer and allow your Mac to print to it\n\n*it's free\n\n\nThe best part is that everything will be native and not emulated.  Emulating things just adds another layer of complexity to the problem.\nHowever, I am not quite convinced that you don't have a faulty printer. Just doing a quick search there does seem to be a Mac OS X Driver for this line of printers.  A Quick look at their website gave me this result:\n\nIf you are not seeing your printer either natively on OS X nor using the Windows drivers through an emulator whether it is connected via USB or Ethernet, I would connect it to a PC to verify compatibility.  VirtualBox is the next best thing to a native PC.\nYou you connect it to Ethernet, you should be able to ping the printer.  If not, then you have an issue with the printer itself.\n", "Q: Why \"Documents & Data\" is consuming so much space in iPhone?

Is there any way to bypass the ID Apple problem in my case?\n\nA: You should try to find the model.  The only Mac Pro not capable of running the latest OS is the MacPro1,1.  I think they were from 2006-7.  \nOlder computers which existed before 'free' OSX upgrades had to purchase them via the App Store.  It's possibly trying to verify an Apple ID that was used for this.  \nIf you have access to another Mac, you can build a bootable USB with an OSX installer.  First you need to obtain the Install OS X app. As per Apple:\n\nUse these steps to download the version of OS X you want to install.\n  From the Apple menu, choose App Store.  Hold the Option key and click\n  the Purchases tab. You should see the versions of OS X you've\n  previously purchased. If you don't see your purchases, log in to the\n  App Store with the ID you previously used to install OS X.  Click the\n  Install button next to the version of OS X you want to download. The\n  Mac App Store normally displays OS X as being \"Installed\" in the\n  purchases pane. This prevents you from downloading it when your Mac\n  already has the same version of OS X installed. When you hold the\n  Option key as you click the Purchases tab, the button to the right of\n  the item you want to download should change to say \"Install\". If it\n  doesn't, use Spotlight to search for \"Install OS X\" on your computer.\n  It's likely you already have a copy of the same OS X installer in the\n  Applications folder, or on a connected drive.\n\n(I'll just quickly summarize the rest; if you get this far, and have questions, just respond and we'll try our best.)  Once you have the installer, you'll also need at least an 8 GB flash drive.  Wipe it and format as GUID and HFS.  Then follow these instructions to create a bootable installer.  Once done, plug it into the Mac, hold option while booting, and select the USB drive. The rest is self explanatory.\n", "Q: How do I make the folders and files wrap on Finder in Mac OSX?

I've noticed my machine keeps swapping memory even though there is (at this moment) around 7 GB of RAM still free; does anyone have any insights on why this is happening, if I should care, and if so, how I can stop it?\nSee this image:\n\n\nA: This looks 100% normal, fine and not at all even beginning to look like a problem.\nSwap is for items that the system determines aren’t needed actively and frees up RAM for other tasks that can benefit. You have a very large proportion of free memory so the system is well in the green.\nApple’s activity monitor now has a “pressure” gauge so I would look at that and only worry if you see large page in / delays or yellow / red pressure on Apple’s graph.\nTo check page rates to and from swap, open a shell in terminal.app and run:\nvm_stat 60\n\nYou will see counts per minute and the swap in and out are the ones to worry about. Next would be that you have a stable and low amount of free pages so that number going down to 0 or 10 would be worrisome about swap or allocations. Until then, you’re likely at full speed with any amount of swap that’s not filling your drive causing other issues.\n\nA: \nDoes anyone have any insights on why this is happening\n\nAs officially documented by Apple, this is happening to keep a preferred portion/percentage of memory free and available for immediate allocation as processes request it.\n\nif I should care,\n\nNo, you should not care, as long as performance is not suffering. The time to start caring about swap is when you experience long delays when switching between apps or when the entire systems slows down. When a system uses swap space to the point of thrashing, the resulting slowdown is not subtle, it is major and painfully obvious.\n\nif so, how I can stop it?\n\nThe only practical steps to take are to add more RAM or run fewer applications at the same time, but until you are seeing significant slowdowns or getting error messages, it is not worth trying to stop the system from swapping memory to disk.\n", "Q: How can I assign \"middle click\" to a button on my mouse?

I don't want to see this message on my lock screen every day, how can I acknowledge the message and disable it?\n\nA: Removing the management profile\nSomeone else mentioned how to remove the management profile from the phone. That has some potential issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your boss may not want you to remove the profile, which may lead to undesired consequences like being fired\n\n*You may lose access to any resources the profile allows you to access\n\n*You may start sending things unprotected directly over the Internet rather than through the VPN your profile sets up for you\n\n\nWhy the message probably can't be removed\nAs far as leaving the profile there, it's very likely that you can't remove the message because a lot of people are used to their personal iPhones being secure and private and they need to be informed when their privacy may be at stake because they may be being watched.\nIf they're issued a work phone, they may incorrectly assume that the security and privacy are just as good as their own iPhone.\nIf they let an untrustworthy acquaintance use their personal iPhone, they may have no idea that it's even possible for the acquaintance to take a few minutes to begin managing the phone and to then spy on them later.\nImagine if the boss or the untrustworthy acquaintance could just turn off the warning right after beginning to manage the phone. The user of the phone would then be kept in the dark about potential spying.\nThere's no easy way for an iPhone to distinguish between a spy disabling the message and the user disabling the message, so there's no easy way to allow for what you want while still ensuring users receive that vital information.\n\nA: According to the 9-to-5-Mac Blog, the message is simply is alerting you that your iPhone has a profile installed using the MDM program.  These are files inside your phone called .mobileconfig.  I've linked above to a cached version of this blog, from Google.\nThese are mostly used to control which preferences and applications you have enabled by default, although there are nearly unlimited advanced uses.  For example your company could easily erase or lock your phone, if desired.  For readers' future reference, you can also create your own profiles or use 3rd party profiles, not just get one from a company.\nDepending on the settings of the profile you may be able to remove the profile without your company's consent, although that might not make them happy:\nGo into Settings and look at the settings for Profiles. You can remove the profile from there, if your company is not blocking you from removing profiles.  This may not only make the message go away, but also modify the look and feel of your phone, as well as, remove things you need, like automatic access to company VPNs or wi-fi networks.\nThere may be a setting within the MDM from your company, that with their admin tools (even just a simple tweak in Profile Manager) where they can disable this message that you don't like;  I would say just ask about it.  The blog above speculates that this feature has been added because soon there may be more ways implemented for companies to track employees using their managed iphones, in addition to the many already-possible ways to track people using iPhones or other cell phones, such as using GPS.\n", "Q: What is the most OSX or Darwin-like command-line experience available (without buying an expensive Mac or hauling my production machines home)? I want to emulate the command-line experience from OSX with a small netbook and practice my skills with the comfort of this small machine.\nSurely Apple offers actual Darwin Links for developers or sysadmins...  their url is even \"OpenSource.Apple.com,\" but so far the images I've found in web-archives seem even older; see for example this post or this unix & linix post.  \nI thought FreeBSD would provide this, and I'm loving using FreeBSD, but OSX has incorporated so much more into the systems that I feel like it is not accurate training or the answer to my question.\nIt is possible to get an .iso of so-called Pure Darwin (The successor to Open Darwin), but it seems like it focuses on VMware images and getting people into a GUI (which is cool, but not my goal here), plus it is naturally a bit out of date.

Currently my Verizon Wi-Fi Calling on iOS 9.3 works fine at home but not at work (which I control so I can modify it). The two networks have different base stations and routers but I haven't yet found anything different enough between them to account for the non-working Wi-Fi Calling on my work network. \nIn the article https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203032 at the bottom in the Get Help section it states in point 3:\n\nConnect to a different Wi-Fi network. Not all Wi-Fi networks work with Wi-Fi Calling.\n\nIs there a list of what is required to make a Wi-Fi network support Wi-Fi Calling? I have yet to find anything other than the ports listed on https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202944 about what is needed for a Wi-Fi network to support Wi-Fi Calling.\nDoes anyone have pointers to more documentation or know what needs to be enabled for Wi-Fi Calling to work? Are there any debugging methods I can try out there?\nUPDATE: I didn't end up making any changes on the network and now the Wi-Fi Calling is active. I'm just going to go scratch my head for a while and assume it was an upstream issue I hadn't had a chance to diagnose. Thanks all for the replies and information.\n\nA: What's now often called Wi-fi calling is actually GAN (Generic Access Networking), so you can prioritize the UMA packets; according to Apple's link you shared above, that is port 500, using IKEv2 over UDP.\n\"Some types of network traffic (like DNS and IPsec-encrypted) need to be permitted by the network,\" to get UMA to work, according to a Wikipedia user.\nAlso, there are conflicts with Apple's Continuity and Wi-fi calling, so it is possible some settings on a Mac or other device at your work are blocking it.\nTo go deeper, you could find troubleshooting documentation directly into the GAN/UMA protocols.  The site I wanted to reference quickly, Umatoday.com, was down as I tried to access it now.\n", "Q: How to prevent change in network configuration? I want to know if there is a way to prevent users (even administrators) to change a network parameter (dns domain for exemple).\nNot simply \"lock\" the parameters and be allowed to unlock them with a password to change them, I want something like the GPO on windows that disables totaly any possibility to change the network settings except if the local policy itself changes to re allow it.\n\nA: Get the latest OS X Server.app. Enable all appropriate services. One important service is the Open Directory Service.\nThen enable and configure the Profile Manager. With the Profile Manager you can set up OS X and iOS devices. Beyond a lot of other features you can also restrict access to all System Preferences items.\nCompletely explaining the set up and the configuration would be beyond the scope of an answer. Please check Apple documentation or a walk-through like this one.\nWith additional tools like ADmitMac and a Windows AD environment you can also use Windows GPOs.\n\nA: It's hard to say.  There are certainly third party management products that leverage config profiles etc. to lock down options.  But it's very difficult to stop that via the command line if there are admins.\nFor example, I suppose you could  set a launchagent to watch specific network plist files, and do something if they're changed.  You would also have to think about cached preferences (cfprefsd and all).  However it may prove inadvisable to interfere with the normal operation of the OS.  \n(Administratively speaking, messing up a network config and losing communication with all your machines would be a nightmare. :) \nYou may also want to consider achieving your goals by other means.  If you're having issues with people changing DNS entries, you could simply schedule a script to run every day that reverts DNS.)\n", "Q: What does \"slide to upgrade\" do? On iOS 9, after restoring from a backup, a screen comes up that says \"slide to upgrade.\"\n\nThis doesn't update your iOS firmware, right? I imagine it just prepares your backup for iOS 9. Is this correct? I have scoured Apple's support articles, Reddit, and the likes. All I can find is information about a bug related to the slide to upgrade screen.\n\nA: I just bought an iPhone SE. It came pre-installed with iOS 9.3.2. I set it up from an iPhone 5s iOS 8.1 iTunes backup. When the restore was complete, I was greeted with the \"slide to upgrade\" message. I slid it, and a loading bar with the Apple logo was displayed.

It is now asking me to update to iOS 9.3.3.\nThus, \"slide to upgrade\" does not update your iOS firmware to the latest version, it likely just prepares the old backup data for use with with iOS 9.\n\nA: Great question! For anyone worried about this I want to confirm that \"Slide to upgrade\" does NOT update iOS (Apple really should change that message to avoid misunderstandings).\nMy iPhone X was on 12.4.1, and I just restored from a backup from iTunes and got the same \"Slide to upgrade\" message. At the time of restore 12.4.1 wasn't signed (only iOS 13.1.2 and 13.1.3 was).\nAnd after doing \"Slide to upgrade\" my device was still on iOS 12.4.1.\n\nA: If you restore, on any device that can accept that iOS, you will have to update too.  I imagine this is one of the reasons why 'they' say not to restore a jailbroken phone [not that I've ever had one].  \nI've never actually seen the Slide to Upgrade, as I don't do upgrades/restores OTA, always connected to iTunes, but on iTunes it wants to fetch the update before it will let you do anything else at all.\nThe only exception would be an iPhone 4, etc, which has reached end of life.\nFollowing comments that you can revert to an earlier version by downloading the .ipsw file - this is always going to be the case for a few weeks after an update, but will always timeout & leave an upgrade as the only alternative most of the time - research shows me that indeed today is that day (6 April 2016) for 9.2.1 - Following release of iOS 9.3 & 9.3.1, Apple stops signing iOS 9.2.1\n", "Q: Creating a new user account using iCloud password I am trying to create a new OS X user account using iCloud password but the option to do that isn't displayed.\nI am on OS X 10.11.4\n\nAccording to this support document I should see an option to pick the kind of password and set the iCloud ID.\nFileVault is turned off, so I can't think of a reason for this to be happening.\nI also don't have the option to change the iCloud ID on my current account.\nIf I create the account I can't set the iCloud ID on it either.\nAny help would greatly be appreciated.\n\nA: The linked iCloud/OS X Password feature appears have been removed in 10.11.4\nThe Change Password Dialogue box used to ask if you wanted to link your iCloud password with your account, now it goes directly to \"Old password/New Password\" \n\n\nA: I ended up using steps 1-6 on this website.\nBasically in single user mode in the terminal I ran:\nmount -uw\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nshutdown -h\nI then set up the iMac using the other account I wanted to create.\nWhile this isn't an ideal solution (and may bring some other issues?) it works until Apple fix this issue.\n", "Q: Plugging USB hard drive put my Mac to sleep I just plugged a USB hard drive into my MacBook Air and for some reason it immediately went into sleep mode (it also stopped the music I was playing on iTunes). What could be the issue? Is it something I should worry about?

If this happens only once, I wouldn't worry about it too much, however if it becomes a repeat issue, it could mean there is a problem with the power regulation, the USB port, or both.  \n", "Q: Why can't I left click on my Macbook Pro?

As fun as it is to toggle mouse keys on and off, I’d really like to get the clicking working. Please help. I will be happy if this has a stupid easy answer.\n\nA: Let's just say it's a story of unknown Bluetooth interference or a paired Bluetooth device that’s in range of the Mac. \nI had this very issue last week on my Early 2013 15' MacBook Pro with Retina Display. Normal (Left) mouse-click wouldn't work under any conditions while running OS X, the built-in Trackpad, Magic Mouse or USB Mouse, while the secondary-click was fine on all.\nI booted my MBP with a Linux Mint Live USB Flash Drive and the built-in Trackpad, Magic Mouse and USB Mouse all worked, both normal-click and secondary-click.  So at least I knew the built-in Trackpad, Magic Mouse and USB Mouse hardware was fine and it was looking like a software issue.\nAs another trouble shooting process I made an OS X USB Flash Drive Installer, figuring it would boot clean and the built-in Trackpad or Magic Mouse would work fine since it worked under Linux, however during the install... no normal-click would work, while the secondary-click was fine.\nTurns out my Magic Trackpad, which I was not using and was in the closet, was depressed by a book that fell over on to it.  Because it was connected, even though not in use, it was causing the other clickable devices to fail on the normal-click while the secondary-click still worked.\nThis drove me crazy for a couple of hours because the book fell when I was not in the room, so I never heard it or suspected the Magic Trackpad to be an issue.  Linux Mint Live USB Flash Drive worked because the Magic Trackpad was not paired to it and therefore couldn't and didn't interfere.  Unlike in OS X it automatically connected.\nWhat a pain it was but who doesn't love a good mystery!\nDo you by chance have a Magic Trackpad lying around? \n——\nOr a Bluetooth mouse in a travel bag - if that mouse is pressed down, you can’t ever get a left mouse up event from any other device. \n\nA: I have experienced this before.  Your trackpad is faulty and is probably stuck in the \"clicked position\".\nFirst thing:  Try disabling the trackpad.  In terminal, issue the following command:\ndefaults write -g com.apple.mouse.ignoreTrackpadIfMousePresent 1\nYou may need to reboot.\nIf the problem goes away while using your USB mouse, then the issue is your trackpad.\nIf you have Apple Care, you should take it in for service.  \nIf you are comfortable doing the repair yourself, it is a fairly inexpensive part to swap out.  Amazon has them for under $35. It will require removing the battery to gain access to the track pad.\nifixit.com has excellent guides on how to do this.    \nIn the meantime until you get it fixed, you should use a regular mouse or an external trackpad.\n\nA: TL;DR: Try to rule out 'Ctrl' key hardware malfunction if you are unable to left-click.\nI encountered this question when attempting to solve my own problem of inability to left-click on a Macbook Pro, so I'll put the solution here in case it helps anyone.\nI have experienced a similar situation in which every 'left click' attempt both from an external mouse and the trackpad seemed to be interpreted as 'right click'. I followed a similar set of error-fixing attempt steps as described in the question. This included me attempting to reset the NVRAM multiple times, but was unable to do so -- the login screen kept appearing as normal.\nThe cause of both of these issues was a stuck 'Ctrl' key on my external keyboard. This prevented the Cmd+Option+P+R reset from working, and also causes each left click to seem to be interpreted as a right click.\n\nA: I experienced the left mouse button stuck in clicked position issue.\nIt turned out I simply had a Magic Mouse inside my backpack, paired with the mac, turned on and -of course- pressed.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences → Accessibility → Mouse and Trackpad. Slow the double click speed.\n", "Q: What iPhone model is shown in Apple's Recycling video? In Apple's most recent event, they highlighted their environmentally-friendly products.

So I just updated to iOS 9.3 and everything seems fine overall. But when I launch the Music app, I used to be able tap on the name of a track while it was playing to view/edit the star rating. But now if I do that it just oddly brings me to the same track again… And again… And again…\nIs this a “feature” or something? The UX on this seems weird. Is Apple ditching star rating for the hearts/love thing? What’s the deal.\n\nA: So I accidentally figured this issue out. Where before you could click on  the name of a track to view/edit the star rating, now the UX for that is to click on the album artwork. The artwork blurs and the star ratings show up dead center in that area; see picture below.\nStill doesn’t explain the weird UX of tapping the current track name bringing you to the same current track name again and again.

Activity monitor shows finder using ~24 gb of RAM (screenshot below), when my machine only has 16 gb installed. I figure this has to be a bug because \"Memory Used\" only shows 9.62 gb, and I'm not experiencing any slowdowns. However, it's a little alarming and if there's an easy fix I'd like to take care of it. I'm using the most up-to-date Apple OS software as of writing (3/22/16). Thanks for your help!\nJack\n\n\nA: You're showing that you do have 16Gb installed - that's the Physical Memory number shown at the bottom.\nThat 24Gb number is for compressed memory. Because it's compressed, and might not be being physically used, you can go over the physical limit.\nThis explains it: http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/06/12/compressed-memory-in-os-x-109-mavericks-aims-to-free-ram-extend-battery-life \n24Gb RAM used for Finder is still a little excessive though.\nIf you look, you're using 12Gb of swap, which is where your extra memory that's being used is coming from. You're swapping it all out to disk.\n\nA: I would say that this is a bug in the display.  If you were to use top -o mem in Terminal.app, you would likely see something like this:\n\nAs you can see, in this view, no single app is using more than 720M (because we're sorting by RAM usage, we only see the top RAM-hogging processes).\nIt's also possible that your Activity Monitor display is removing a decimal point, because 2.4G would be slightly more reasonable for Finder to occupy.\nPossibly relevant links: \nhttps://superuser.com/questions/669331/osx-mavericks-using-way-too-much-ram\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2784719?tstart=0\n", "Q: AirDrop between WiFi networks I have a Fritzbox acting as WiFi Access point and handing my home DSL connection, DHCP etc. I also have an Airport Extreme connected via network cable to the Fritzbox, only creating a Wireless network.\nThe wireless networks on both the FritzBox an Airport have the same SSID, password etc. I can only see one WiFi network SSID when I search for available WiFi networks.\nThis appears to work okay, however I haven't figure a way to Airdrop from my phone which is often connected to the Fritzbox WiFi network, and my Mac which connects to the Airport WiFi network (due to location in the house).\nIs there a way to set this up so Airdrop (and probably bonjour?) can see devices on both WiFi networks?\n\nA: Basically, you need to establish a permanent wired Ethernet connection from one of the LAN ports on the FritzBox to the WAN port on the AirPort Extreme.\nThen, configure the AirPort Extreme to create a wireless network using the same wireless network name, same wireless security settings and same password as the Fritzbox router.\nThe last step to check would be to make sure that the AirPort Extreme is configured to operate in Bridge Mode, so it will function correctly on the network.\nFrom https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5152388?tstart=0\nIf you've already done all this, make sure that your cables are good and everything.

If I go and type whoami in Terminal, it says vlado too. So this is fine. But in my folder structure in hd/Users/vlado/Applications I don't see my Applications, which I can otherwise see through Finder. I have my applications no problem and I run them no problem, but the folder structure is confusing me. Shouldn't the applications go into my user's (vlado's) folder structure and not to hd/Applications?\n\nA: Just a quick answer....\nItems in the Applications are system wide, not per user.  You can deny Users access to particular applications, but in general they are available to everyone.\nThe User folder holds items that are specific to each user and only available to each user individually and the superuser (root).\nMacworld has a good article that goes into this further\nAlso, OS X Daily had a nice summary table of the folder structure which should be helpful:\n\n", "Q: Command line equivalent of Disk Utility, which is not diskutil, to obtain UUID Following on from the answer to Can you make OSX mount just certain partitions when you connect an external HDD?, all of the sites that I have checked (CNET, OSXDaily, Apple Support community threads) say that you have to use Disk Utility (or the command line diskutil info /dev/disk<X>s<Y>) to find the UUID. \nIs there a command line equivalent that will give me this information, which is not diskutil? In particular, one that will work in single user mode?\nWhy diskutil does not work\nIn single user mode (at least on Mountain Lion) after running: \n/sbin/fsck -fy\n/sbin/mount -uw /\n\nrunning: \ndiskutil info disk0s5\n\ngives the following error\nUnable to run because unable to use the DiskManagement framework.\nCommon reasons include, but are not limited to, the DiskArbitration\nframework being unavailable due to being booted in single user mode.\n\nBackground\nMy issue is that I have a dying partition on my internal disk, which only holds an out of date Snow Leopard OS, but is slowing down my Mac (unbearably), as the console is (repeatedly) reporting:\nkernel: disk0s5: I/O error.\n\nI no longer boot into Snow Leopard as I boot Mountain Lion which is on an external FireWire disk, so I would like to leave the Snow Leopard partition unmounted, using the line\nUUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX none hfs rw,noauto\n\nin /etc/fstab. \nHowever, to obtain the UUID of the faulty partition, I have to open up Disk Utility and have the faulty partition mounted, which is a torturously slow process (it takes Disk Utility about twenty minutes to open).\n\nTL;DR -\nCan I obtain the UUID of the internal partition, when booting into single user mode of an OS stored on a partition which is on an external FW disk?\n\nA: Update:\nIOReg gives the partition UUID, not the volume UUID, as it operates below the HFS layer. I had incorrectly assumed that the device UUID was required rather than the volume UUID because it was substituting for a device node. To get the volume UUID, use hfs.util. For example:\n/System/Library/Filesystems/hfs.fs/Contents/Resources/hfs.util -k disk0s3\n\nReplace \"disk0s3\" with whatever the \"device identifier\" of your volume. This is different to the \"device node\" (which is \"/dev/disk0s3\" in this case\").\nOriginal IOReg details:\nYou can run ioreg -c IOMedia -r to show the device tree for the disk devices in your system. This should give a manageable amount of output (as compared to ioreg -l, which shows everything).\nIf you want to just extract UUIDs, you can ioreg -c IOMedia -r | grep UUID, but the downside is that you lose context.\nThe diskutil information is interesting; it obviously depends on daemons that do not run in single user mode.\n\nA: Install GPT Fdisk. After booting to Single User Mode enter:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n/sbin/mount -uw /\n/usr/local/bin/gdisk\n\nIn interactive mode first enter the device node (e.g. disk0):\n/dev/disk0\n\nthen i to show detailed information on a partition.\nFinally enter the partition number e.g. 5 to get the Partition unique GUID:\nPartition GUID code: 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC (Apple Core Storage)\nPartition unique GUID: 7AA0FD56-01BC-4EA1-8CE2-7972E63A2A6D\nFirst sector: 409640 (at 200.0 MiB)\nLast sector: 133955543 (at 63.9 GiB)\nPartition size: 133545904 sectors (63.7 GiB)\nAttribute flags: 0000000000000000\nPartition name: ''\n\n\nA: As an aside, I have just discovered that there is no actual need to do any of this, because, en lieu of using the UUID, you can use the volume label instead, in /etc/fstab, like so:\nLABEL=Archive none hfs rw,noauto 0 0\n\nThis method has the benefit of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Being much simpler to implement, and more importantly;\n\n*The volume label does not change, whereas the UUIDs change as you plug in other FW or USB disks. So, if you are using UUIDs  in /etc/fstab then you need to update those UUIDs for the unmounted disks, in /etc/fstab, each time you change the disk configuration.\n\n\nNote: The use of the LABEL in /etc/fstab, may not always work (i.e. if the disk is very corrupted and the label can not be read). In such cases, you will be obliged to use UUID.  \n", "Q: Setting up execution path in Terminal I have no experience with using Terminal but I am trying to install a program msbayes \n(installation instructions here. \nThe instructions say to set up an execution path using either\n$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nOr \n$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nI have tried both of these but am still getting a command not found response.

When it's actually working, it works just fine without stutters of any kind.\n\nA: If you can touch the cable and have it drop in and out, I would say you either have a bad cable or bad connector (or both?) on one of the computers.\nTry your setup with a different cable and see if you get the same result.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I think it has to do with the timing. Did you connect your Thunderbolt cable before or after your iMac reached the login screen?\nI do not know how target display mode is programmed, but I think all sound drivers on your iMac should be initiated first, before you connect the cable.\nSo when sound is not working, my simple solution is: CmdF2 out of target display mode, disconnect the cable. Wait a few seconds, reconnect is,  CmdF2 back into target display mode. It does the job for me.\nNext time, make sure your iMac reached the login screen and the hard drive isn't making much noise anymore before connecting your Thunderbolt cable.\n", "Q: How to present my IPhone screen on Windows I must present my iPhone screen on a skype meeting, but Skype for business does not appear to have that option. \nA coworker said me that there is some official app that i could use to share my screen on my desktop computer running Windows 10. Of course, I searched on appstore and the internet with no luck. \nSo, could you point me out in the right direction?\n\nA: One solution is to use Mirroring360.\nYou can mirror from iPads or iPhones to a Windows or Mac computer. Mirroring an iPad / iPhone or Mac screen is achieved using the AirPlay™ technology made by Apple, all you need to do is simply install the Mirroring360 application to the computer you wish to mirror to and start mirroring!\nOf course, mirroring a Windows PC screen requires the installation of Mirroring360 Sender on your PC.  Make also sure that the computer and the mirroring device are on the same WiFi network.\nYou can download from here. You have a 7 days trial, then it will cost 14.99$.\nAs the website says, this tool is useful for presentations, screening recordings, classrooms and so on.\n", "Q: SIM required after iOS update I have just updated iPhone to latest iOS. I do not have a phone contract and do not have a sim. I get an error message stating SIM required. How do I bypass this step. \n\nA: Another method to activate your iPhone is using the iTunes application. Follow the steps below to activate your iPhone without a SIM Card.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install the latest version of iTunes from Apple on to your computer.\n\n*Using an iPhone compatible USB data cable connect your non-activated iPhone to the computer.\n\n*Run iTunes on your computer and follow the instructions which show up on the screen to activate the iPhone.\n\n\nThat’s all now you can use your iPhone without a SIM card.\n", "Q: Customise Restrictions passcode on iphone I know you can customise the iPhone main passcode to strengthen the security but there doesn't seem to be that option when doing the same when setting up restrictions. After I have written it down somewhere I don't want to remember the passcode, and I definitely will if't it only 4 numbers. \nIs it possible to write an app for something like that?\n\nA: Very much doubt Apple would allow any app to access that API.\nThe restrictions passcode is so hard you need to wipe the phone & start over if you forget it.\nIf you really don't want to know what the code is, get someone else to set one & not tell you what it is. You then have the opportunity of changing your mind later, assuming they remember it.\n", "Q: Create a symbolic link do navigate with cd Is it possible to create a symbolic link to easier change directories? like\nln -s /Users/mles/Documents /usr/local/bin/d\nso I can cd d instead of cd ~/Documents?\n\nA: The problem with creating a symbolic link in that manner is that you are limited to where the symbolic link is created.  It also adds to the problem if you have a directory ../d/.. somewhere on your system.\nThere are a couple of ways to solve this....\nCreate an Alias\nIn terminal, you can create an alias by issuing the command\nalias cdd='cd ~/Documents'\nThe benefit here is that it will work anywhere without having to add it to your PATH.\nTo make it permanent, add the command to your .bash_profile in your home directory.\nMake a variable cd-able\nAlso, in your .bash_profile add the following\nshopt -s cdable_vars \nexport Docs=$HOME/Documents\n\nNow, when you type cd Docs it will expand out HOME to whatever your user directory is plus the directory you specified. (/Users/yourusername/Documents)\nPersonally, I did this with a variable called icloud as follows:\nexport  icloud=$HOME/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/\n\nNow, I can reference my iCloud documents location without having to remember that lengthy path.\n\nA: You can define variables pointing to your directories. For example:\n[~]$ export d=~/Documents\n\n[~]$ ls -l $d\n[~]$ cd $d\n[~/Documents]$ \n\nIn bash you can use cdable_vars option to be able to cd without preceding $:\n[~]$ shopt -s cdable_vars\n[~]$ export d=~/Documents\n\n[~]$ cd d\n[~/Documents]$ \n\nBut it does not allow dropping $ for other commands, so ls -l d won't work.\n", "Q: How to reauthorise a Google account in Internet Accounts (after changing Google Account password) on Mac OS 10.11 My Google Account is connected to Mac OS X using Internet Accounts. I changed the password of my Google Account (at google.com) and now the OS - and especially Mac Mail - can no longer access the account.\nI believe that Mac OS X is using OAuth to authorise with Google, so is it possible to force the OS to reauthorise the connected account (without deleting and starting again)?\nMac OS Version: 10.11.3\n\nA: Have you tried opening System Preferences > Internet Accounts? Opening it will usually ask you to reauthorize when you've changed passwords. If not you can try checking and unchecking Notes.\n", "Q: How to enable password lock on Notes in iOS 9.3? I recently got iOS 9.3 for my iPhone, but I'm not finding an obvious way to password-lock my Notes. This feature was advertised by Apple as part of the iOS 9.3 package, but is it only available for certain devices, similarly to Night Shift?\nI'm using an iPhone 5C, but the problem also seems to be occurring on my iPad Air 2.\n\nA: The relatively difficult-to-find solution to the problem is to go to the Note you wish to lock:\n\n\n*\n\n*in the top-right corner, tap the \"Share\" icon\n\n*on the bottom row, there will be a lock symbol with a caption that says \"Lock Note\". \n\n*select that symbol\n\n*you will be prompted to create a password that locks this note, but remember that this single password will secure all your protected notes, not just the note you're on. \n\n\nYou can also use Touch ID to secure your notes. Remember that if you secure the note, it will no longer be accessible by devices running versions of OS X older than 10.11.4, or devices running a version of iOS different from 9.3 or higher. Next time you try to open that Note (or others that are locked with the passcode), you'll be prompted for your password to unlock it.\nYou can change the Notes password by going to your Home screen, then Settings > Notes > Password.\n\nA: Angelplayer's directions are great. Except be sure your note is in iCloud Notes. If the note has options to handwrite on it (a squiggly button in the bottom toolbar of the note), then it is in iCloud; otherwise it is not.\nIf you use Gmail or another non-iCloud service to sync your notes, Apple will not let you lock them (they would still be visible in Gmail and Apple does not want to give you false confidence about the secrecy of the notes).  \nHow to set up iCloud Notes: Go to Settings on your iPhone/iPad, tap iCloud, then toggle on Notes. \nOnce your notes are synced with iCloud, you can tap the export button in the top left of a note and tap \"Lock Note.\"\n", "Q: Magic mouse 2 scrolling not working after installing windows 10 I have installed windows 10 via boot camp. Now when i start up with windows , i can move magic mouse 2 on the screen but scrolling with mouse not working.\n When i start up with Osx 10.11.4 magic mouse 2 does not have problem.\n\nA: I would recommend updating the Bootcamp application and drivers through Windows by using Apple Software Update. It is likely an outdated driver being on your system which does not have the proper information to handle the newer Magic Mouse 2.\n\nA: navigate to \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Apple Software Update\" and run the updates. You will be able to se the scroll feature.\n", "Q: Force Re-Download of El Capitan from the App Store? I'm trying to download the latest version of El Capitan (10.11.4) to build an updated flash drive installer. I fire up the App Store, click the OS X El Capitan link on the right, then click the Download button. A pop-up warning asking:\n\nWould you like to continue? OS X v10.11.4 is already installed on\n  this computer. Use the Updates page to install the 10.11 update or if\n  you would like to download the full OS X installer click Continue.\n\nSince this is indeed what I'd like to do, I click the Continue button. The pop-up goes away and the spinner in the upper left keeps going. Eventually, I get tired waiting for the spinner to stop, so I'll go to a different desktop and do stuff or minimize the App Store window. When I return to it, the spinner is gone, nothing is downloaded, and I can no longer click the Download button. (The text appears slightly less dark.) \nI can exit the App Store, restart it, go back to the El Capitan page and do the whole process again, but nothing seems to let me download the full, latest version of 10.11. Even if I use defaults to enable the debug menu on the App Store, bump the logging level up to 4, there's not a lot of info shown in Console. \nRestart didn't change behavior. Disabling the Little Snitch network filter didn't affect anything. \nAny suggestions for how I can d/l this version to build an updated install drive?\n\nA: Here's how I did it!\n- Open Mac App Store\n- Go to Purchased\n- Look for El Capitan\n- Hold the Option Key + Click Download, you should see the progress bar in front of it.\nYou're done!\n\nA: I had the exact same issue. The culprit, in my case, was that I had older versions of the installer in other locations on my drive.\nThe solution was to move all older versions to the Trash and reboot. I did not empty the Trash, however (just in case). Upon rebooting, the App Store behaved and I was able to re-download the complete OS 10.11.4 installer. Then I emptied the Trash of all of the older versions.\n\nA: Same problem on my MacBookPro6.1 17\" Mid-2010.\nIn my case, the solution was taking these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Signed Out of App Store;\n\n*Searched for \"El Capitan\" by using the App Store search bar;\n\n*Clicked on \"El Capitan\" on the search results;\n\n*Clicked on the button to get it;\n\n*Provided my email/pass when App Store asked for them;\n\n*Confirmed App Store question to buy it.\n\n\nAfter these steps, the download started immediately.\nWhen the download was finished, the file \"Install OS X El Capitan.app\" was placed on \"/Applications\" folder. \n\nA: Had this exact problem. Tried the Sign-out of App store recommendation and still failed. When the store is trying to download the OS X El Capitan installer app, it scans all your mounted drives to see if you already have the installer.  If it finds an older El Capitan installer app (in my case I saved a backup copy on a separate volume to free up space on my startup drive), it will determine you're ineligible for download of the full installer app and point you to install the update from the Updates store instead. Even if I clicked Continue, the download would just do a spinning sprocket and never prompt me for my App Store log-in.  Once I unmounted my backup volume with the old installers, the App Store prompted me for log-in and began the download of the latest El Capitan installer app.\n\nA: You're doing nothing wrong procedurally. The servers are busy is the likely problem. I would restart your Mac (perhaps in safe mode) and try once again. Looking in /var/log at the system.log, commerce.log and install.log might show an actionable error.\nAssuming you haven't installed other software that's modifying things network wise - you may need to wait things out or try from a new user account - try from another clean OS install.\nIn time the error should clear up. You could also download things directly:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/downloads/macos\n\nA: I rather skeptically followed Lucas Brero's instructions. In my case, the trick seemed to be---I needed to accept new terms and conditions. These were only presented after I followed those instructions! Then, the button changed to \"Downloading\" and I got a progress bar. \n\n\n*\n\n*Sign Out of App Store\n\n*Search for \"El Capitan\" by using the App Store search bar\n\n*Click on \"El Capitan\" on the search results\n\n*Click on the Download button\n\n*Provide Apple ID and password\n\n*Confirm terms and conditions\n\n\nA: I ran in to this issue as well only to find out the I had to agree to some new license agreements in the app store prior to downloading. Silly thing was it did not tell me until after I updated/restarted and such. Once I agreed I tried again and low and behold it worked. \n", "Q: EPUB files are not syncing through iCloud for iBooks along with iOS 9.3 Since 21 March 2016, I am able to sync any books via icloud between devices. It works pretty good for pdf. But it doesnt work for EPUB files. I have downloaded for my iPhone some EPUB file from the website and saved to iBooks, but it didn't appear on my another device, while the pdf did appear. \nWhat is wrong?\n\nA: In iOS iBooks try tapping the \"Collections\" selector top center of the app below the system time and turning OFF \"Hide iCloud Books\".\n\nA: OK, I actually did the OPPOSITE and it worked -- Turned ON \"Hide iCloud Books\" and restarted the app and suddenly everything was synced up.\n", "Q: After enabling two-factor authentication, I no longer have the option to use my iCloud password to log in I enabled two-factor authentication (the new one available in iOS 9, OS X 10.11, etc., not the old two-step verification) for my Apple ID. After doing so, my MBP prompted me to change my password saying that I couldn't use my iCloud password to log in to it anymore, so I changed it. I expected the same thing to happen on my iMac, but it didn't. iMac is still happily using my iCloud password to log into my local account. Going into Users & Groups & clicking \"Change Password\" for my account on my iMac, I still get the same old \"Use iCloud password...\" option, but on my MBP I don't have that option.\nIs this expected behavior? Why can I still use my iCloud password on my iMac, but not on my MBP?\n\nA: I would suggest logging out and then back into iCloud on the affected machine to ensure that it has the most current and up-to-date settings. It is likely that there is just something stuck, considering both systems are running the same OS.\n", "Q: Turned off iCloud, but still deleted my photos from all devices I got a new phone (iphone 6s) so I wanted to wipe my old one (iphone 5s), once I had signed into icloud on my new device everything was recovered, photos, contacts, apps etc. So I turned off iCloud on my old phone so it wouldn't remove everything from my new phone and laptop. However when I deleted my photos it still deleted them off all my other devices, I have now lost over 1000 photos! It didn't wipe anything else I deleted just the photos! Is there a reason for this? Or anyway I can get my photos back?! \n\nA: The problem is you misunderstand how iCloud Photo Library works. It syncs your photos so that all devices match at all times. Therefore, when you told it to delete your photos on your old phone, you were telling it to delete them everywhere. You can restore them from the Recently Deleted folder on your Photos app and/or www.iCloud.com.\n", "Q: How bad is it to run an ancient Mac Pro with an unsupported OSX? I have an ancient (c. 2007?) Mac Pro running OSX 10.7.5 at work. It's so old, Software Update no longer allows me to update to a newer operating system. I use a lot of software provided by MacPorts, and I'm finding I'm having issues that may be related to not being able to update. I'm no longer able to update certain software, either. I use it to ssh to when I'm not in my office, so it's open to the network (though I expect that it is protected to some degree by my institution's network).\nUnfortunately, I lack the funds to purchase a newer model! \nI know running an outdated computer has problems: \n\n\n*\n\n*Software vulnerabilities don't get patched, exposing me to hacks (eep!)\n\n*Possible instabilities with 3rd party software that might install on my system but not work with my system. \n\n*The most current versions of some software packages won't install\n\n*I miss out on some of the new features of the newer OSs (e.g. Messages)\n\n\nI'm primarily concerned with the first problem listed.\nQuestion\nWhat are some other risks, and how can I evaluate and/or navigate them? Is it really, really bad for me to run it like this--so bad that it might be advisable to install and use Linux instead (as described here)? \n\nA: If you have the 2007 Pro 1.1, 10.7.5 is the end of the line for you. But depending what you need to do, it's not all bad. I have a 2010 pro and run only Snow Leo, 10.6.8 most of the time. \nThe only thing you can do is monitor what apps no longer function, and save up for an upgrade. $600 or so to jump to 2010 pro.\n\nA: Running an older OS opens yourself up to attacks, as security patches are no longer issued. As those vulnerabilities are discovered, they can be exploited. You could try to safeguard against this by using 3rd-party AV software, but it cannot be guaranteed as it is up to the vendor to continue supporting older OS's. There is no telling how bad these exploits may be, it would depend on a variety of environmental factors combined with your unique personal activities which would increase the likelihood of stumbling across one of those vulnerabilities. \n\nTL;DR: There is a risk, no matter how you slice it. We cannot determine for you how major that risk is beyond informing you that running old software is bad practice. Either determine a way to get to a newer machine, or install an OS which has regular security updates still issued for it. \n", "Q: Embed Keynote presentation on website Is there any way to get a Keynote presentation up on the web somewhere? There are things like SlideShare, but they seem to only work with PowerPoint. \nI see that Keynote provides a variety of export options, but each one is problematic in one way or another:\n\n\n*\n\n*PowerPoint: things get cropped weird, transitions are awful\n\n*HTML: weird DHTML format that only seems to work in Safari\n\n*PDF: not really a presentation\n\n*Quicktime: umm... no\n\n\nMy presentation has a lot of precise formatting and transitions (nothing too over the top, but things do move around) that I'd like to preserve. Also presenter's notes would be nice. \nIs there anything out there that I can use?\n\nA: My answer is No. I have been looking for weeks. I have tried many programs, read many articles, and even called apple. Apple said, \"We do not make our software with web development in mind.\"\n\nA: I know this is an older question, but the latest updates (this week) to Keynote actually do allow you to embed a Keynote. This is Keynote 7.1 for Mac and Keynote 3.1 for iOS. \nThe features are very limited. Your slideshow can't do anything complex, including transitions and builds. But, it seems to work pretty well. Getting the embed code is a little tricky, so I built a simple little tool for getting it here: \nhttps://keynoteiframe.com\nYou should be able to embed Keynote slides anywhere that allows iframes. \n", "Q: iPhone 6s not displaying names on text messages I have a brand new iPhone 6s which suddenly stopped displaying names on text messages after I downloaded iOS 9.3. Any new ideas?\n\nA: I tried the answer above but that didn't work for me. After some trial and error turning off contacts in iCloud and then turning them back on worked for me. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to settings > iCloud\n\n*Turn off \"Contacts\" option\n\n*It will ask you if you want to delete the contacts synced on the phone or keep them. I deleted them.\n\n*Verify that the contacts are gone. (Optional)\n\n*Go back to the iCloud settings and turn the contacts on. \n\n\nThis worked for me. Took about a minute for all contacts to resolve in Messages app. I am on iOS 10.2 and this happened when my phone turned off unexpectedly due to battery issues.\n\nA: None of the answers here worked for me. I had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app.\n\n*Scroll down to Contacts.\n\n*Tap the Short Name option.\n\n*Turn off the Short Name switch at the top.\n\n*Go to the home screen. \n\n*Open the Settings app.\n\n*Turn the Short Name option back on. \n\n\nAfter that procedure, the Messages app on my iOS device once again showed names instead of phone numbers.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Settings->Messages\n\n*Scroll down to the header SMS/MMS\n\n*Uncheck \"MMS Messaging\"\n\n*Restart iPhone\n\n*Go back to \"MMS Messaging\" and turn it on\nThis should fix the problem\nEdit: This bug has been reported to Apple by many users under bug ID 22817380\n", "Q: Mount all mountable partitions of a removable disk with diskutil I have a USB drive containing 2 FAT partitions which are automatically mounted when the drive is plugged in.

This\nfunction is no longer permitted under El Capitan.\n\n*Removed flash drive, inserted flash drive, unmounted disk using\ndiskutil, and mounted disk using diskutil. Everything works fine.\nNo problems.\n\n*Boot to El Capitan OS X 10.11.4.\n\n*Removed flash drive, inserted flash drive, unmounted disk using\ndiskutil, and mounted disk using diskutil. Everything works\nfine. No problems.\n\n\nOne difference I did note. Your fdisk output shows the id for the FAT formatted partitions as 0C. Yosemite created these partitions, on my Mac, using the id of 0B. I used the fdisk command to change the id of the first partition to 0C. Now when I unmount and mount the flash drive using the diskutil command, the first partition does not mount. The remaining 4 do.\nIronically, if I use the command \ndiskutil mount /dev/disk1s1\n\nthe first partition, on the flash drive, mounts. (On my computer, I am not using core storage, therefore, the flash drive is disk1.)\n\nA: Though I can't verify this, I think the problem is related to the nodev flag of the partitions. In theory the nodev flag doesn't allow a non-root user to create a device node like /dev/disk2s5. So you have to prepend sudo to remount the mountable partitions of the disk.\nThe following should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create mount points: mkdir mnt1 and mkdir mnt2\n\n*Mount the partitions \nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk2s1 ~/mnt1 \n#and respectively for the 2nd partition\nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk2s5 ~/mnt2\n\n\nRechecked with a real thumb drive:\nSimply use:\nsudo diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk2\n\ninstead of diskutil mountDisk /dev/disk2\n", "Q: IOS Upgrade Downloading for every device I have many apple devices 5 iPhones and 4 iPads to be exact\nI upgrade by connecting to my Mac and then from iTunes\nSo when upgrading iOS, it's downloading the software every time?\nI would understand the reason for having separate download for iPad and iPhone but for all my phones it has to download 1.59GB every time\nWhich is time consuming and also wastage of my download\nQuestions\nIs there a way to make it so when i upgrade my phones it uses the same file\nsame goes for iPads\n\nA: If you have identical devices, even if they are synced to different computers using different iTunes, then this is the way to save the download bandwidth...\nYou can choose to do the download via iTunes for the first device, or directly by picking the correct ipsw file from https://ipsw.me which simply provides direct download links - the downloads themselves come directly from Apple in both cases.\nAssuming you are on Mac...\nif you are using ipsw.me then skip this step.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the first device then when asked about the update select \"Download Only\". This gives you chance to sync & backup first, but otherwise doesn't affect the update. Allow the update to finish, then disconnect the device.\nYou now have the downloaded file.\n\n*If you are going to share this update to other computers, or other Mac user accounts on the same machine, then you need to find it & copy over...  \n\n*From Finder, open a new window then hit  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   G  for 'Go To...' then copy paste ~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates & hit  Enter ⌅ \nInside there you will see the downloaded ipsw file.  \nnow rejoin if you got the file from ipsw.me... but remember the path from the last step \n\n\n*Copy [don't move] this to your other locations using the same method to find the folder, or if the other users are on the same machine, copy to a 'public' folder that all users can see, then get each user to copy from there to their own folder\n[each user has their own folder, accessible from their own account using the same path, as in 3. above].\n\n*Connect any of your identical devices to iTunes from the correct user account for that user.\nYou can now begin the standard update process, the update file is already there & will be recognised.\n\nA: I feel your pain, here is how I solved the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to https://ipsw.me/\n\n*Download the iOS(s) you need for your devices\n\n*Go on iTunes\n\n*Back up your devices\n\n*Hold down the Shift button and click on \"Restore\"\n\n*Find and open the .ipsw for your device (make sure you chose the right one)\n\n*Sync the device with the back up and you should be set!\n\n\nA: I had the same download size when I connected my iPhone to my Mac. But when I disconnected it and attempted to update it, the download size was only ~300MB. Downloading it via WIFI on your phone is much easier as you don't have to leave your Mac on to download a 1.59GB update. So if you really don't need to update them via iTunes, try updating each of them on their own via WIFI.\n", "Q: Is it normal for MacBook Pro CD/DVD drive to makes noise on wake after long sleep Every time I put my MacBook Pro (13in, mid-2012) to sleep and shut the lid, then wait at least 20 mins then open the lid and wake it up, my CD/DVD drive makes an odd sound as if it thinks there's a disk in there to read but then realizes there isn't and stops the sound.\nMany of my friends own MacBook Pros and none of their CD/DVD drives do this on wake after a long sleep. I should probably also mention that this sound only started happening about 6 months after I bought it, it's now 1.5 years old.\nSo, is it normal for my MacBook Pro to make a sound on wake after a long sleep?\n\nA: Yes.\nAfter all, OS X wants to allow you to access what's on the disc currently inside the drive. When you eject a disc, the system reacts by no longer showing the disc on the desktop or in Finder. When you insert a disc, the system reacts by showing the disc on the desktop and in Finder.\nWhen the system is asleep, it's no longer keeping track of whether a disc has been ejected, inserted, or replaced with a different disc. It has to check what's in the drive when it wakes up in order to react properly to what's there.\n\nA: Yes, but I've seen different sounds and behaviors across different Superdrive manufacturers. Since Apple only buys the drives from other hardware producers, like Mashita, they are basically commodity hardware, and not all of them are as exquisitly designed as the rest of the MacBooks ;) but don't worry, in a few years you probably won't have a Mac with any spinning disk in it anymore! \n\nA: Yes.  I've never figured this out, but some older models with disc drives would definitely make a noise when waking.  Even if there was nothing in the drive.  (My mac mini 2009 does this too)\n", "Q: Setting up new iPhone 6 issues and major headaches Old iPhone 5 16Gb all backed up on iCloud. Tried to set up my brand new iPhone 6 but turned out the last (manual) backup attempted on the 5 hadn't fully completed. Reinitiated a new mail backup on my old 5 to iCloud (18 mins), just attempted to set up new 6 using iCloud but get \"error connecting to iCloud\". Reset new 6, finally logged into my Apple account but showing zero available iCloud backups with which to restore new 6.\nOver an hour and I still cannot even use my new 6!  Currently getting out windows laptop to do it all again manually via iTunes. Just feel like taking the 6 back to the shop. \nWhat can I do to ensure a good restore?\n\nA: iCloud syncing over iPhones of different generations can be tricky. I highly recommend backing up your iPhone 5 directly to your computer (not iCloud) and then syncing that back up file to your new iPhone 6.\nOnce all the old data is on your iPhone 6 you can then sync it to iCloud through your iPhone 6 (which can be done in the background).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: One thing to check is the exact build on the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6. If the 6 is at a lesser build version than the 5, no backups will be shown by design.\nOnce you've gotten both devices updated and backed up, If iCloud servers are under increased load and have elevated API errors, you might need to be patient. Once the iPhone 5 gets a good backup, you can try again there.\nUsing iTunes to make a local backup might be a great plan and way to avoid any congestion between you and the iCloud servers. It would also cut out busy servers if that is causing you slowness.\nAnecdotally, my iCloud backups seem about twice as slow in the 48 hours surrounding a launch. Before the launch, a lot of people presumably are making backups. After it, lots of people chose to wipe their devices and run with all the new settings and defaults for a while before restoring the backup.\nIt's no fun delaying your new purchase - but I can't think of any other things than to a) avoid the cloud b) make lemonade and try the new phone without a backup while you wait for the iPhone 5 to finish a backup.\n", "Q: How to batch download all files in a Volafile.io room? \nVolafile.io Live Filesharing & Chat\n\nExample URL: https://volafile.io/r/$ID. \nThere is Feature request: Download all the content of a room in a .zip file. #117.

This changes the default code to from cat to:\n for f in \"$@\"\n do\n     echo \"$f\"\n done\n\nNow you can use $f to act on the target Folder(s), e.g. cd $f and now you're in the directory of $f and can add additional code to act upon the files/folders within $f, etc.\nUpdate:\nUse the following working code as an example:\nfor d in \"$@\"; do\n    cd \"$d\" || exit\n    for f in *.log; do \n        [ -f \"$f\" ] || continue   \n        rm \"$f\"\n    done\ndone\n\nWithin the Test and Test copy folders there were a number of .log files and files with other extensions as well.  When the above code was run it deleted only the *.log files within the target folders as show in the images below using two folders or one folder and both files and folders with/without spaces in their names.\nNote: The screen shots below do not contain the error handling that was added to the example shell script code per comments to this answer.\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to detect any certificates not packaged by Apple? I recently received a Mac and connected to my employer's network. When I connected, my Mac (not browser, it was in the connection dialog) asked me to do something with a new certificate. I accidentally clicked yes before I got past the title, and am worried I installed a root cert that allows my employer to see my encrypted traffic. Is there any way to check for any installed certificates not put there by Apple? \n\nA: Chances are you installed the certificate that was required by your employers network.  For example at my work place we have 802.1x authentication on our Wifi, basically users log in with their normal username and passwords instead of a pre-shared Wifi key.  When they log in they must accept a certificate from our servers.\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that your employer can see your encrypted traffic, however it is very possible.  It depends what kind of infrastructure your employer has, i.e. do they have a system that does SSL inspection?  You won't know unless someone in IT tells you.\nYou can view the installed certificates through Keychain Access (Finder --> Utilities --> Keychain Access).  For my 802.1x Wifi there is a certificate in the 'Certificates' section at the very bottom of the left column (not the My Certificates).\nNever-the-less you will be able to see all installed Certificated here.\n", "Q: Is disk version of iWork 08 compatible with El Capitan Opened a iWork 08 Pages file created in 2015 and very little appears.

IS this a El Capitan issue?\n\nA: If you have installed iWork from disc you may be able to then upgrade to the latest version via the App Store. It's been a while since I tried it but it worked a few years ago.\nThat would then give you a compatible version that can open the older files.\n", "Q: Running brew doctor shows I have 3 different python \"config\" scripts installed.

A package called watchdog por monitoring file system events and triggering actions. It's actually a python package, but it also includes a shell utility so you can create scripts from the terminal without actually coding.\n2nd. use a small program called fswatch which uses Mac OS's File System Events API to monitor your files and folders, and can trigger scripts. \nThey both require you installing the package/program, and seem to do what you require.

The only thing I can think of would be mobile Time Machine backups, but I have no idea.\n\nA: I think you might be on to something here, the .MobileBackups folder is supposed to be invisible, but sometimes does actually take up storage space. The other thing is caches, they can easily grow to gigabytes in size, though I wouldn't expect them to take up 100 GB by themselves...\nWhatever the case, if you still have your files in your home folder, then you're probably good! But I hope you made a backup before installing the update anyways, right?! \n\nA: Mac OS X allocates swap space in the file system (in /private/var/vm – don’t touch these files!) and when the system reboots it reclaims that space.  If you’ve been running programs with big memory footprints they could have consumed a lot of disk by virtue of that and it would only be released when the system restarted after upgrading.  It may not have been the upgrade, it may just have been the restart that caused the disk space to be released.\n", "Q: Login in the app store in Turkey I recently purchased a Iphone 5 in turkey, and when i try to log in into the app store is asking me for a credit or debit card. \nHow do I by-pass this?

When I checked it on System, it says 8 GB RAM. But I wonder, if I put 16 GB of RAM in the two slots of my MacBook (2 8GB sticks) will it work?\n\nA: Some Mac's can utilize more then the official amount stated however according to EveryMac.com, the actual maximum amount of RAM a MacBook Pro \"Core i7\" 2.66 GHz 17\" Mid-2010 can utilize is 8 GB.\nI've found that information presented by EveryMac.com to be very accurate in this area and wouldn't waste my time or money trying to put 16 GB in this model MacBook Pro unless it can be corroborated by an authoritative source.\nAs mentioned in the comments by RedEagle2000, \"Mactracker says the same\" and they too are known for being very accurate in this area as well.\nAlso at crucial.com, from Micron Technology and one of the top Semiconductor producing companies in the world, the model you have can only take 8 GB. \n\nA: I always used 16GB RAM even before OS X officially supported 16GB on laptop, and (1) I never had problems and (2) the OS did recognise and use all the RAM.\n\nA: I will add I currently placed 16gb of 2x8gb sticks in my Macbook Pro 6,2 i7 2.66ghz and it worked- however in a short time it gave kernel panics and shut off and on at an alarming rate. if you are going to try this successfully- I recommend trying it with TESTED ram first- which probably isn't easily done- but I seemed to narrow it down to quality of the RAM sticks I used.

I want to block sideloading the apps (ipa) to my iOS devices (iPhone, iPod, iPad). I googled about it and to my surprise, everyone was asking questions on how to sideload the apps. \nSo, if anyone could help me in identifying this, it would really be a great help. \nThanks. \n\nA: Without the device being jailbroken or having a development provisioning profile installed, there's absolutely no difference between an app installed via the App Store or via \"sideloading\", except that one might be able to install an old version of an App Store app. Or possibly an app which the developer removed from the app store by choice. It's simply not possible to install any app that's not originally from the app store via \"sideloading\" without it being configured for development as all applications must have a valid App Store code signature.

I've had a computer failure and had to replace my computer with a new one. I have a Time Machine backup that I want to use to restore a large number of files from, but I don't want to do a full system restore. My old setup was a little crufty, and the OS version is old, so I want a new, clean OS/Application install. I don't want to use the Assistant, because I want more fine grain control over the files I'm copying over.  I know how to use the \"Browse other disks\" function buried in the Time Machine setup, but this is a pain.\nMy question is about what you see when you browse the disk in the Finder or the Terminal. It lists the backups by date and time stamp, along with a shortcut to \"Latest\". I know Time Machine making a complete copy each time it backs up. My understanding is that it's not copying the diff each time it runs, it's just recording a new copy of any files which have changed since the last backup (like a directory diff).\nWhat then does the user actually see when the browse to a particular folder with a given timestamp? Is OSX representing the filesystem in such a way that these folders look like a point-in-time representation? Can I just treat them as such without having to use the stupid animated, kill-everything-else on screen, Time Machine program?\n\nA: You can safely restore files using finder or the command line (rsync or other) if you want to avoid using the Time Machine animation.\n\nThe reason why needs explanation: Technically, the system uses hard links. So if you make three new files on the desktop named A, B and C and then make three backups. This is what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first backup copies the new files to the correct location on the backup drive (in your user's home folder for the time specific snapshot - or /Volumes/Drive/Backups.backupdb/mac_name/2011-07-03-123456/Mac HD/Users/you/Desktop/A and B and C.\n\n*The next backup detects that the file is unchanged and makes a hard link in the next backup interval desktop directory pointing to the original file on the first backup.\n\n*Now modify file B and make a backup. There will be one copy of A, C - each with link count of three (three intervals have that version) and there will be two versions of B one version with link count of 1 and one version with link count of 2.\n\n\nNow the file \"exists\" in both directories with a link count of 2. Any copy operation copies the correct bits to the new place, and if you deleted one copy (Time Machine prevents this with Access Control Lists) of file A it would decrement the link count on the file and remove it from the folder list where you deleted it.\nEventually when the link count of a file is 1 - deleting it deletes both the data and the entry for the file.\nFor your case - you could pick a time and copy whatever files you want as hard links don't cross volume boundaries and you'll end up with a non hard linked file with link count 1 where you put the file on your current disk.\n\nYou didn't ask, but be sure to use tmutil to clean up files on the Time Machine or the graphical interface. They understand link counts and work well. If you try to delete files manually (say dragging them to trash) - you are in for a bad time unless you are sneaky about it.\n", "Q: Can I use my Mac's speakers and AirPlay / Bluetooth at the same time?

But if you use Airfoil you will have to use 2 different applications to play the music (eg. Spotify will stream to AirPlay while Chrome plays on Mac). I know Airfoil isn't the fix you're asking for but it's the closest solution you are likely to find.\nhttps://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/mac/\n\nA: I don't have a rectangular Airplay button on Itunes, but if I click the circular airplay icon to the right of volume bar, I get multiple options to redirect the audio output, similar to the picture in the accepted answer (MacOS 10.14.6, ITunes 12.9.5.5).\nHowever, as is mentioned in the comment to the accepted answer, my Airplay broadcast disconnects as soon as I try to change the audio output in ITunes.\nI was, however, able to direct audio from VLC to my built-in speakers without affecting the Airplay output.

Then run this script.\n\nset oldDelims to AppleScript's text item delimiters\nset the_strings_to_strip to {\"ee\", \"shot\", \"Z\", \"at\"}\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set the_files to the selection\n    --\n    repeat with a_file in the_files\n        set the_name to name of a_file\n        repeat with I from 1 to count of the_strings_to_strip\n            set AppleScript's text item delimiters to item I of the_strings_to_strip\n            set the_text_items to text items of the_name\n            set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"\"\n            set the_name to the_text_items as string\n        end repeat\n        set the name of a_file to the_name\n    end repeat\n    --\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDelims\nend tell\n\nThe idea is, you have your set of characters or phrases that you want to strip. Then, you use them as \"text item delimiters.\" Normally text item delimiters are \"\". So, when you have a word like \"cat\" the text items are \"c\", \"a\", and \"t\". But, if you SET AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"a\" instead of \"\" you will only have TWO text items in the word \"cat\": \"c\", and \"t\".  Then, when you set the text item delimiters back to \"\", and then you concatenate the text items, you've essentially done a search and replace: replacing your string with \"\". \nI tried this on a bunch of screen shot files and it worked fine. \nNotice that at the end, I set AppleScript's text item delimiters back to whatever they were when the script started. It would be a good bet that they were \"\" but just in case, I record what they were, and restore them at the end, in case they are/were something other than \"\". No point guessing when you can know for sure.\n\nA: \nIf I misunderstood your issue and/or example, forgive me, but if I did, other people probably have too. Thus, if that is the case, please provide us more realistic examples.

It can be deployed, for e. g., from Terminal window with a SHELL-command:\nsudo launchctl reboot userspace -s\n\nPractice\nEl Capitan\nI tested it in El Capitan on a Macbook Air 2015 where it worked. But I also have report from a user that his attempts on El Capitan were unsuccessful though. The only difference I can think of is Retina which requires different graphics mode or somesuch. I don't have Macbook with Retina running El Capitan, so for the time being I can't tell anything more in support of such a version.\nHigh Sierra, Mojave\nMy tries with High Sierra were showing that this functionality is no longer working (compared to El Capitan). Again, may be it's due Retina, it's not clear. Mojave doesn't have it working also.\n\nThorough explanation by a contributor¹\nThere is a way to get back down to single user mode from an up und running macOS without doing a full reboot by running\nsudo launchctl reboot userspace -s\n\nThis will relaunch just the userspace part of macOS without restarting the Darwin kernel and is equivalent to changing the runlevel on old-day-UNIXes.\nFor additional details see man launchctl:\nreboot [system|userspace|halt|logout|apps|reroot ]\n    Instructs launchd to begin tearing down userspace. With no argu-\n    ment given or with the system argument given, launchd will make\n    the reboot(2) system call when userspace has been completely\n    torn down. With the halt argument given, launchd will make the\n    reboot(2) system call when userspace has been completely torn\n    down and pass the RB_HALT flag, halting the system and not ini-\n    tiating a reboot.\n\n    With the userspace argument given, launchd will re-exec itself\n    when userspace has been torn down and bring userspace back up.\n    This is useful for rebooting the system quickly under conditions\n    where kernel data structures or hardware do not need to be re-\n    initialized.\n\n    -s       When rebooting the machine (either a full reboot or\n             userspace reboot), brings the subsequent boot session\n             up in single-user mode.\n\nThis means that on a technical level sudo launchctl reboot userspace -s doesn't call reboot(2) and therefore provides a way to switch to single user mode without a reboot. \nAlso the Wikipedia article on Single user mode says:\n\nIn OS X El Capitan and later releases of macOS, the mode can be reversed to single user mode with the command sudo launchctl reboot userspace -s in Terminal, and the system can be fully rebooted in single-user mode with the command sudo launchctl reboot system -s.\n\n\n1 — Courtesy of @nohillside\n", "Q: give read&write permission to only 1 file in folder I am trying to manually modify preferences file located at \n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist\n\nTo modify it, I need to give it read&write permission.

How can I see why it is disabling?\n\nA: I use Viscosity as my VPN and by default it disables time machine upon connecting to the VPN. It is pretty much always on so that is why it seemed to be disabled all the time. I was able to fix this by disabling the option to disable time machine when connected to the VPN. \n", "Q: Notify the system that preferences were changed I disabled SIP (How do I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA \"rootless\" on OS X 10.11, El Capitan?) and started editing the file /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist\nI successfully edited the entries HTTPProxy, HTTPPort, HTTPEnable and save the file. Then I checked my IP address on the web, and it doesn't change. The file is set correctly, but the system doesn't know it changed and therefore it uses the old settings. When changing settings manually, hitting Apply in the Network Tab notifies the system that preferences.plist has changed and that it must use the new settings. Same goes for turning wifi off and on. I changed the file, checked the IP (it is the same) turn wifi off/on, checked the IP and now it has changed.\nHow can I trigger that event of notifying the system of changes programmatically on a Mac?\n\nA: Your question needs some editing and clarification.\nWhat I think you're asking is, how to force OS X to re-load data after editing a plist file.  There are two methods of doing this.\nOS X uses a caching daemon for preferences, cfprefsd.  You can simply save your plist file, then do  sudo killall cfprefds.  It will restart automatically, and should load your changes.\nThe recommended way of forcing changes is with the defaults command, which informs the daemon of the changes. For example\n\n# Reveal IP address, hostname, OS version, etc. when clicking the clock\n# in the login window\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow AdminHostInfo HostName\n\n\n\nA: This is the wrong way to adjust the network settings on OS X. The network is managed by configd, which reads its settings from /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist at startup. Changes should be made via configd, so that it can update its live state, the actual network interface settings, and the preferences file all together.\nI know of three ways of doing this: via the Network pane in System Preferences, with the networksetup command, and with the scutil command. scutil is messy, so I don't recommend it; fortunately networksetup is easy to use. Something like this should work:\nsudo networksetup -setwebproxy Ethernet proxyserver.example.com 80 off\n\nNote that \"Ethernet\" is the user-friendly name of the network service (/interface); use networksetup -listallnetworkservices for a list. Also, the \"off\" argument means that proxy authentication is off. See the networksetup man page for more info.\nBTW, please turn SIP back off. You do not need to turn it off in order to change the network settings.\n", "Q: What if I don't want my keyboard occupy 2/3 of the screen?

Literally any bluetooth keyboard will work with any iOS device, and when that keyboard is active and connected, no on screen keyboard will be present, so you'll get the entire screen used for contents. \nOr like other suggestions:\n-Vertical mode uses less real estate\n-Splitting the keyboard uses even less real estate\nBut what do I know, I'm a \"fan\"\n\nA: Nope; currently that's not possible even with the latest version of iOS.\n", "Q: El Capitan Remove Finder from Application Switcher (cmd tab) I'm having trouble removing the Finder icon from the application switcher in El Capitan.

I can't figure out how to get it back. \nMy question is: How do I change my health app from a bar graph to a line graph?\n\nA: Simply the answer is: you can not change because of the update\n", "Q: My app is showing install size instead of download size in App Store My uploaded iOS app is showing 28.3 MB size in the App Store app on an iPhone 5s. As per the Estimated App Store file size from iTunes Connect, my app size will be as shown in the image.\n\nMy concern is that it is showing the install size (28.4 MB, the amount of disk space that the app will take on the customer's device) in the App Store app on the iPhone 5s.\nI think it should be Download Size instead of Install Size. Is anything wrong with the size showing in the App Store? Or is it so?\n\nA: The App Store shows the install size because this is the amount of storage space the user requires on the device once the app is installed. The download size is rarely useful. There is nothing you can do to change what is shown on the App Store page.\n\nA: This is due to download size for different device is variant . So before build for appstore check that you are build for universal ipa.\n", "Q: How to fix Final Cut Pro X's \"Modified File\" message Final Cut Pro (FCP) X 10.2.3 today gave me the most unhelpful warning message in my timeline: \"Modified File\" - thanks Final Cut Pro! What can I do to fix this problem?\nI've tried relinking the clips, Googling just lead to more questions and no solutions. Anyone have a clue?\n\n\nA: Found a solution to this.\nIn FCPX go to File -> Delete Generated Event Files -> Delete optimized media, restart FCPX = Voila!\nThat worked for me instantly. Hope you guys find it helpful too.\n\nA: Open the finder window and find the photo.  Drag it into the timeline to replace the \"Modified\" image and it should reappear. \nGood Luck.\n\nA: Open Package library content - open folder \".fcpbundle//Transcoded Media/High Quality Media\"\nFind media file or alias for modified file.\nCheck file or alias for correct properties. In my case alias had wrong old destination. I find destination file, make alias, copy to folder above, delete wrong alias, and rename new alias. Restart FCPX and error gone.\n\nA: Apple's Final Cut Pro X: Alert icons support document says only:\n\nModified File : A media file has been changed by an application other than Final Cut Pro.\n\nHave you tried recreating the optimised media and proxy files?

Where are Google Chrome cookies located on a mac?\nI went\n~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies, but I don't think that this file is the one. I cleared cookies, went to this file, copied content, brows a little, paste the content i copied back into the file and saved.

19:21 PlugIns\n\nIt looks correct to me, but I might be wrong.\n\nA: It seems that at some point, plugins were moved to (Edit: it seems these are only the standard plugins and plugins added by the user are still in the old place.  The standard plugins may have been there forever for all I know.)\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns\n\nI was able to reproduce this problem by changing permissions on one of the plugins residing in the above directory.  (Edit: You get the same if you change permissions on the plugins in ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/ but since you don't have any of those, it shouldn't matter.)\nThe permissions should be drwxr-xr-x\nso in Terminal:\ncd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns\nsudo chmod 755 *\n\nshould help, possibly with the -R option.\nNote: If you have a very old Xcode installation that has been upgraded since the dawn of time, plugins may show up in (at least) the following locations:\n~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins\n~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Shared/Plug-ins\n~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Plug-ins\n\nI would delete them all and put new ones in the current standard location.  (I just did)\n\nA: I managed to get it working again by downgrading to version 7.2.1. Not ideal, but at least I can work now!\nUpdate:\nBecause of changes made in Xcode 7.3, I was having Issues doing certain things, so I downloaded Xcode 7.3.1 and it works.\n", "Q: Remove \"Other...\" from Login screen I've just upgraded to El Capitan from Mountain Lion, and now an Other... icon appears right next to my usual user-account (admin account) on the login screen.\nWhen I click on it, I can log in, as another user, but I only have one.\nMy first thought was, that it could be the root user, which could have been enabled (I don't know how though). But from the Edit menu, in the Directory Utility, it only says \"Enable root user\", which should indicate that the root user is disabled. I then tried to enable it, and disable it again, but the Other... still appears on the login screen.\nI've even tried to disable it from Terminal using this command, with no luck:\ndsenableroot -d\n\nAfter some search on Google, I found a thread with people having the same problem.\nA lot of them solved the problem by following this guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the root user from Directory Utility and then log out.\n\n*Log in as the root user account and change the password.\n\n*Still on the root user account, disable and then enable root user from Directory Utility.\n\n*Log out from the root user account, and log back it to the usual account.\n\n*Now disable the root user once again.\n\n\nI have done all this, but it still doesn't work, and I am almost going mad about it.\nAnyone have any idea why this is happening, and how to fix it?\n\nA: It can be changed by using Terminal command: \nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED -bool FALSE\n\nOne can also revert back:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED -bool TRUE\n\n\nA: I solved this a different way, a better way in my opinion, in my case the root user was active so I turned it off following Apple's instructions.\nJust in case the above link stops working, these are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences\n\n*Users & Groups\n\n*Unlock (bottom left)\n\n*Login Options\n\n*Join\n\n*Open Directory Utility\n\n*in Directory Utility Unlock (bottom left)\n\n*In Edit Menu, select Disable Root User\n\n\nNote: I don't know why the root user was active. It might have something to do with the Guest User or with Find My Mac.\n\nA: I finally found a solution!\nAfter some more search I found this command:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED -bool FALSE\n\n..and it did the trick!\n", "Q: How to skip iOS 9.3 update? Is there a way to skip this (or any future) updates?

This will bring you up to the latest, most reliable and up-to-date version of iOS, but if you don't want to, that's definitely fine.\n", "Q: Adding an icon for a custom input I have a custom input (.inputplugin) installed already. I'm curious how I can change the icon of the input from just the C in a box to my own icon. The installation was rather finicky so I'd rather not uninstall it, and I'm not really in favor of using Ukelele. Any ideas? Thanks!\n\nA: Normally you create an .icns file with the same name as your keyboard and put it in the same location and it will appear instead of the Apple default.  You can get sample .icns files with the Ukelele download.\n", "Q: online automatic wallpaper changer I use a tool called variety which sets automatic wallpaper to my Linux machines via various websites like deviantart, wallpapers.net, flickr etc. \nIs there such tool for MacOSX? \n\nA: I use Irvue, by Leonspok.

You can grab one under $10 from eBay.\nIt will work but you might experience some heat generating at times. Also the monitor that you connect via USB can feel slightly laggy.\nWhat I did was using the USB connected monitor for minor stuff which will require less refresh rate, more like references, social apps, etc and use the Thunderbolt one as primary.\nAlso, if you are planning to use this setup for long, try upgrading for a Macbook Pro. It has better cooling and has more ports. You will not regret the upgrade ;-)\n", "Q: Is there a way to find out which app on an iPhone just made a sound? My phone is making two sounds, but not providing any other notifications.  I have no idea what is causing this.

I also recommend restarting your phone. \n", "Q: Port forwarding on Airport Express IPv4 I'm facing an error with port forwarding on my Airport Express.\nI am using the Airport utility application for this and when I go to the network tab and I can see the port settings, then I click +(ADD). I get a small window where I can write the ports but I need to add my IPv6 address which I don't have because I'm on IPv4.\nIs there a way to port forward with IPv4 ?\nThank you\n\nA: IPv4 port mapping will only be available if the AirPort Express has its router mode set to DHCP and NAT. You can check router mode setting in Network tab of AirPort Utility.\nIf you happen to have the router mode set to one of the other settings, then you may have another device on your network running NAT and port mappings would need to be configured on that other device. Another option would be do disable NAT on other network devices and enable it on the AirPort Express so that you can manage port mappings on the AirPort.\n", "Q: Docking Station for 13\" MacBook Pro and Surface Pro 3 Is there a docking station that is compatible with both 13\" Macbook Pro (2015 model A1502) and a Surface Pro 3?\nI am looking for one that has\n\n\n*\n\n*Connectivity up to two monitors (DVI/HDMI/VGA)\n\n*Ethernet adapter\n\n*1 USB Port\n\n*Portable\n\n\nThank you\n\nA: I have a client that has used this model docking station and he seems to really like it.  It's the Pluggable USB Docking Station.\nUpdate:  The USB docking stations in general seem to have an issue with the DisplayLink technology meaning that the dock with the exception of the display will work just fine.\nFrom DisplayLink's website:\n\nKnown issues with DisplayLink on OS X 10.9, 10.10 and 10.11\n  (Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan) \nThe\n  following minor issues have been found on OS X 10.9, 10.10 and 10.11\n  and do not currently have a resolution: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Corruption around window borders for Carbon applications (for example Microsoft Office 2011) \n  \n*Afew applications can show corruption and/or missing contents while\n  updating windows contents.

Shutting down the password service will break large parts of the Open Directory domain service (including local authentication to domain accounts).\nIf you want Open Directory to work, do not shut this down. On the other hand, if you don't want the Open Directory domain, then turn OD itself off (including the LDAP service and its section of Kerberos). On the gripping hand, if you want to use OD but don't want to unnecessarily expose services, then set up firewall rules to limit access to ports 106 and 3659 (and maybe 88, 389, 636, and 749).\n", "Q: How do I upgrade to iOS 9.3 without enabling iCloud Drive? I am (or rather, my brother-in-law is) trying to update the OS on an older iPad, and he's adamant that we need to do this without signing up/enabling/whatever it is that you do with iCloud Drive. So now we're presented with the following question:\n\nAre you sure you don't want to upgrade to iCloud Drive?\n  iOS 9 requires upgrading to iCloud Drive to update documents in iCloud. Until you upgrade, changes made to documents on this iPad will not be available to other devices using iCloud.\nCancel   Continue\n\nUh... mu? Neither of those is a valid answer to the question. What does \"Continue\" mean? Why is \"Cancel\" highlighted? Besides forwarding this to the Interface Hall of Shame, what the heck am I supposed to do here? How do I answer this question in such a way that I will not get iCloud Drive foisted on me?\n\nA: The brother-in-law resorted to a chat session with Apple support, and after wading through a lot of boilerplate, he was advised to choose \"Continue\". It seems to have worked. He did not, however, get any answer to how such a textbook example of how not to write a dialog box got past Apple's UI designers.\n\nA: Select cancel, then select that you'll decide later and continue with the process. You do not need to enable iCloud Drive for any updates to use the device. \n", "Q: Setting up new Mac with old Macbook data I have an old Mac(2010) and want to setup new MB Pro(2015). I want it the way I not only copy all settings but all installed applications(GUI based, command lines) as well as data. I found this tool, I wonder whether it's suffice? Also, new Macs don't have ethernet, will it be OK to transfer WiFi in multiple sessions?\nI have around 250GB of data.\nUpdate:\nI was suggested to use firewire or Thunderbolt. Here is the image of ports on my existing old 2010 Macbook. Which of them is the one mentioned?\n\n\nA: You could do it through WiFi, but a faster option is targeted mode.\nYou will need a FireWire cable to do this.\nMigration assistant copies your home folder (documents, email, pictures, music, etc.) and preferences to the new computer.\nHowever, it does not copy third party applications by default to the new computer. For that, you will have to make a list of your desired applications and copy each of them from the old computer to the new one. You can use Homebrew and Cask to do this but it is probably more involved than just copying in targeted mode or just re-installing. Homebrew can be used to easily re-install command line apps on the new computer. Migration Assistant does not copy command line apps.\nEven if you did copy the GUI apps to the new computer there will probably be a few that no longer work on Yosemite and you will need a newer version.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: El Captian not showing user account after creating second one I am using Macbook Pro with El-Captian. I had only one user account in the machine and I created one another. After creating the new one, old user account is not showing in the login screen.

It will be helpful if anyone can suggest me what I need to do now to get access to the old user account. I tried to change login option to Name and Password, but it also not working. \n\nA: You most probably have Automatic login turned on.

Each book appears under \"Audiobooks\" on my iPod Classic as a single entry.\n\n*I have also imported several books purchased elsewhere, as individual MP3 files. I have ensured that the title, author, etc. are identical and have numbered all tracks correctly. I have set the Media Kind to \"Audiobooks\" and have selected the \"part of a compilation\" option as well as the \"skip when shuffling\" and \"remember position\" options. In iTunes, these books appear correctly, each as one entry, with all the tracks in the correct order.\n\n*I have also imported one original CD audiobook (11 disks) and have curated the meta-data as described above. Again, in iTunes, the book appears correctly.\nAfter syncing to my iPod Classic, all the Audiobooks appear, but only the Audible ones appear as a single entry per book. Each track of each of the MP3 books and the CD book appear as individual entries/books. This makes for a very long list, and, of course, makes it very inconvenient to listen to. I would have to scroll to \"Chapter 1\" of the book I want, listen to it, and then scroll to \"Chapter 2\" of the same book, etc. \"Chapter 1\", \"Chapter 2\", etc. for each book appears in the audiobook list.\nI have searched extensively, but have not found a solution. This answer did not solve the problem I describe.\n\nA: This link suggests using the freeware program called \"Chapter and Verse\" to merge chapters into an audiobook. The latest version is available for download. Note that:\nChapter and Verse requires that Apple Quicktime\nand Windows Media Player be installed to run.\n\nand\nNon-AAC files are automatically converted using iTunes.\n\n\nA: Here in 2017 on Windows 10 64bit installing QuickTime 7.7.9 with all components installed allows Chapter and Verse to run. Otherwise it crashes.\nIt will however not start iTunes to do conversion and instead gives an error saying \"the files cannot be used\". For the conversion one must use a program like \"fre:ac\" to convert to \".m4a\" which can then be used in Chapter and Verse.\n", "Q: Deleted iOS 9.3 update file I was having a lot of trouble installing iOS 9.3 on an iPad Air and after a bit of searching around I was advised to delete the update file and try to reinstall. \nHaving done this, I no longer have the option to try again. When I check for a software update I am notified that I am 'up to date' with 9.2.1\nHow do I get back the option to upgrade to 9.3?\nAny help is much appreciated. \n\nA: Apple yanked iOS 9.3 for almost all devices which means you can't install it.\n", "Q: Safari: using dtrace to investigate iCloud Tab Sync I'm investigating how Safari syncs tabs through iCloud.\nTo start, I really want to know how Safari is updating its shared list of tabs, which means monitoring it or some background daemon for file creations and modifications. (My hypothesis being: when I open a new tab on my phone, iCloud sends a push to my Mac which updates Safari's \"iCloud Tabs\" list.)\nI'm trying to use dtrace to monitor Safari's file opens, with something simple like:\nsudo dtrace -n 'syscall::open*:entry /execname == \"Safari\"/ { printf (\"%s\", copyinstr(arg0)); }'\n\nbut dtrace prints out this error:\ndtrace: error on enabled probe ID 7 (ID 160: syscall::open:entry): invalid user access in action #1 at DIF offset 24\n\n(This is the same error as someone asked on Apple's forums)\nDebugging a strange iTunes permissions problem with DTrace had information about a similar issue with iTunes, but I don't quite understand what backflips they performed in gdb to get iTunes to be dtrace-able.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can someone help me understand Debugging a strange iTunes permissions problem with DTrace: what's the error caused by, and what's the resolution?\n\n*Do you have any additional knowledge/information about iCloud Tab syncing? What process syncs them? Where are they stored on-disk?\n\n\nA: The file that contains the iCloud tabs is:\n~/Library/SyncedPreferences/com.apple.Safari.plist\n\nIt's a binary file, so you can use plutil to convert a copy to JSON/XML for processing. I expected the syncing to be via bird but some light spelunking with brctl log -w and other light snooping don't reflect changes I make to the tab database. There are quite a few nice projects on github that parse this file in python, JS as well as a nice menu bar app:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/josh-/CloudyTabs\nKnowing where the data persists on disk shows that syncdefaultsd is the owning process:\nsudo fsusage -w | grep com.apple.Safari\n\nSadly, that private framework and daemon are basically undocumented by Apple save for what you can glean from the launchd plist for the service.\n", "Q: Finding EyeTV Activation Key from existing install? I have EyeTV Lite installed on my old computer.\nI'd like to move it over to a new computer. I simply copied over the application bundle and everything under /Library/Application Support/EyeTV, but when I try to start up the application on the new computer, it launches the EyeTV Startup Assistant and asks me for the Activation Key.\nI bought the EyeTV 8 years ago... I've long since lost the box, disk, manual, etc... all I have is the software installed on the one computer and the USB dongle.\nIf I launch the EyeTV Startup Assistant on my old computer, it shows me this for my Activation Key:\nARYGC-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX\n\nHow could I figure out what the rest of the Activation Key is, or otherwise transfer it to my new computer? I've looked through Keychain Access... there's nothing mentioning Elgato (name of the company that wrote the software) or EyeTV...\nThere appears to be a SQLite database at /Library/Application Support/EyeTV/EyeTVEPG.db, but when I try opening it with Datum (app I found on the app store), it says the database file is password protected.\n\nA: The above didn't work for me.\nI followed this link instead: https://www.geniatech.eu/eyetv/faq/how-do-i-recover-my-lost-eyetv-activation-key/\nI then downloaded the \"EyeTV Reporter\" application which enabled me to make a full backup and re-installation my copy of EyeTV on my new Mac (without being prompted for any serials).\n\nA: Got it. I copied over these three files that I found inside of /Library/Preferences:\ncom.elgato.eyetv.devices.plist\ncom.elgato.eyetv.plist\ncom.elgato.eyetv.world.plist\n\nNot sure which one of them was the important one, but once I copied those three files over, Setup Assistant stopped asking for my Activation Key, and the application launched properly. Hope this helps someone else in the future, and if not (the product might be too obscure - it's kind of hard to find anything about it online at all, given it was discontinued several years ago), at least it'll help me should I ever want to copy the application to another computer again.\n", "Q: Using postgres with launchd without constant issues I have postgres and passenger installed from homebrew, and use the os x built in apache. I have several rails apps that use postgres which are managed by passenger which in turn is managed by apache.\nCurrently apache is started by launchd at boot from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist, apache starts passenger via /etc/apache2/other/passenger.conf and once I've logged in postgres is started via ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist.\nEverything starts fine and works great until I need to shut down or reboot my mac; then I run into a problem with how launchd tears down everything. Basically Launchd sends SIGTERM to every user process and then 20 seconds later (http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/launchd/launchd-842.92.1/src/core.c) sends SIGKILL, but postgres treats SIGTERM as a \"smart shutdown\" signal (http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/server-shutdown.html) and waits for all it's existing sessions to close themselves before quitting. The problem is that the sessions are owned by the rails apps running under passenger and therefore won't shut down until apache shuts down. And apache doesn't shutdown until the system is shutting down. Which means postgres gets SIGKILLed and leaves it's postmaster.pid file lying around which prevents postgres from starting up the next boot until I rm that file.\nWould moving postgres's launchd plist to /Library/LaunchDaemons/ be a better idea? It would potentially make postgres and apache be shut down at the same time, which given 20 seconds to stop should be enough time for postgres to exit cleanly. But I could be missing an easier solution.\n\nA: I wound up moving the postgres launchd plist to /Library/LaunchDaemons and adding a UserName key/value pair (postgres won't run as root).\n", "Q: Using an iPad to view video from a set top box / DVD player over HDMI? From time to time I need to test set top boxes / DVD players, currently I carry around a 20\" HDMI monitor to test them on, but is it possible to use an iPad as an display with an HDMI input adaptor (perhaps also requiring an app to view the video feed). So the setup would be:\nSet top box --hdmi--> adaptor ----> ipad\n\nA: It can be expensive. iPads are really designed to only output video, but if you have a thousand bucks you want to spend on this device, it should work.\n", "Q: Problems opening links on internet iphone 5S When I search something on google and try to click on the returned items/links nothing happens.

I've just purchased a Dell P2415Q monitor which I've connected up to my MacBook Pro (running OS X El Capitan). Everything works great in terms of the display, however I've noticed that it goes into power-saving mode (i.e. shuts off the display) as soon as I disconnect my MacBook Pro from its power source.\nGiven the battery is already charged up I don't want to keep it plugged in as I suspect it will damage the battery life if I keep it that way for a long time (and I do intend to take my MacBook Pro out and about for other uses).\nDoes anybody know how I can make the display work irrespective of whether my MacBook Pro is connected to it's power source or not?\n\nA: I am happy to tell you that keeping it charging will not damage your MacBook in any way! There is also a way to do your requested way of streaming data to the monitor. You can use the amazing Apple TV. This is not only for TV's because you can stream to monitors, and your own TV! (which personally is amazing if you have a large flatscreen!) However I am not 100% sure this is compatible with all types of monitors or TV's so i would recommend just keeping it plugged in because like I said earlier that will not damage your computer. I hope this helped! The reason your having this problem is because monitors aren't computers. They don't have wifi, you can't connect them to anything wirelessly. Monitors don't have any form of computational power except for converting computer code to images which still requires being connected to a computer to work.\n\nA: As a Single Monitor Workstation Setup (closed-clamshell)\nIf you are in closed-clamshell mode (your lid is down), one the of the requirements is that you must be on AC power.\n\nAs a Dual Monitor Setup\nIf you are using your MBP's display as well as an external monitor, you should still have your MBP plugged into AC power.  Directly from Apple's support site:\n\nYou can probably get around this by disabling the power saving features, but that will just cause you to have to recharge your MBP sooner which means hooking it back up to AC power.\n\nYour Battery\nAs far as your battery goes, it is perfectly fine to leave it plugged in.  I have provided an answer specifically about that in the post \"How to preserve MacbookPro battery from degradation?\" and in this other post, \"What's the best way to prolong the lifespan of a Macbook Pro battery?\"\nBasically, your battery life is dependent on two things...number of cycles and age with age being the biggest factor.  A never used 3 year old battery will perform roughly the same and have the same life expectancy as that of a 3 year old battery used every day.  So, doing the plug it in, plug it out, do the hokey pokey, and turn yourself about  in an attempt to save your battery get's you about the same results as that same dance in a night club.  \n", "Q: Get URL of opened tab / tabs from terminal I have a tab open in Google Chrome.

I'm a noob, but everything I read about support for external displays says that up to 3840x2160 resolution is possible at 30Hz on an HDMI connection. Which is fine for now. But when I try to set the resolution in the display preferences, the largest option I get is 1680x1050. What am I doing wrong? This LG monitor has a Display Port input, so I've ordered a Display Port to Mini Display Port cable, which I assume will give me higher resolutions at 60Hz refresh, but is there no way to get higher resolution at 30Hz using HDMI??\n\nA: Have you tried holding Option and clicking \"Scaled\" in your Display Preferences window?  This should unlock the full range of resolutions your Mac thinks is available for the monitor.  Not sure what that will be over HDMI, but once your DisplayPort cable arrives you should see 3840x2160.\n", "Q: Possible to use airport extreme as second hard drive?

Was wondering if I could use my airport extreme as an extra hard drive?\n\nA: Do you mean a USB drive attached to the AirPort Extreme?\nThe router does not itself have a hard drive. And the facility to add a hard drive is meant as a backup or network storage not as a second hard drive per se.\nThat being said, you could use this option for storage of seldom used files that may be taking up too much room on your MBP.

My grandmother got her iPad somehow in this state where it seems to be in language setup, but taps dont work as expected, rather they activate unusual boxes on the screen:\n\nHow can I fix this? Holding down the power and home button for 10 seconds restarted the iPad but the same screen was there. No interaction seems to be doing anything to advance the setup, the boxes that pop up seem to be interfering. The box in the image appears after tapping. \n\nA: I figured out the answer. This state is called Voiceover, its an accessibility feature for the visially impaired, \nHowever when used unintentionally by someone who doesnt know the special controls of the Voiceover feature, it can seem that the device simply is not responding to touch. \nOne simply has to tap buttons to select them then doubletap to click them, navigate to the Voiceover memu under accessibility and turn it off. Alternatively clicking the home-button 3 times in rapid succession enables/disables this feature. \n\nA: Just press the home button 3 times in quick succession and it turns off.\n\nA: You can put the iPad into recovery mode by plugging it to a computer with iTunes installed. Start with the iPad powered off and hold down the Home button while connecting it to the computer via USB. Hold the Home button down until you see the iTunes connection on the iPad screen.\n\nA: Hold the power button and only power off and then start iPad\nI had the same issue when upgrading to recent firmware and restarting fixed it\nIn past I hold both power and home both to enter recovery but doing so I had to restore to factory default \n", "Q: how to earn being an apple developer So I am learning apple development but I want to know that how am I going to earn once I'm done learning? If its the apps only then I don't have any guarantee that they'll be downloaded and stuff right? so I don't thin that'd be so fruitful. Would it? I'd be really helpful if anyone could help me with this.\n\nA: Are you thinking of being a freelancer / indie developer? Or working for somebody else?  Without that in mind the answer varies from 'it could cost you money' to 'whatever the going rate is'. \nReasoning: if you intend to publish your own apps on the App Store then you will need a developer certificate from Apple, which has a cost to it. For the money however you get access to some excellent tools for developing and publishing apps in a high market place. \nNow what you can earn very much depends on your strategy. For example if you sell your app for $0.99 then after apple takes their cut you will need to have a lot of downloads to make a living from it.  That being said a couple of downloads at that price will cover your expenses. \nIf you offer your apps for download for free then you will need another way to generate money. You could include adverts (not a good idea to my mind) or structure your app to include in app purchases. And then we are back to how many people want the extra functions/content. \nThere are a myriad of choices so I'd suggest \"going to Bing and googling for it\"\nGood luck.

The only option at that point is to reboot. I have tried reinstalling the factory disks, installing Snow Leopard 10.6.3. I have replaced the HDD with a factory Fujitsu. It passes Apple Hardware Test (AHT). I have also created a USB bootable and booted from there. Same results, even with the HDD removed. Beyond that I have been through all the following: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255 (start up options), https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203161 (troubleshooting). The only mode in which it will operate without crashing is in single user mode. I've been working on it for 3 weeks and I'm afraid I'm going to have to throw it away.\n\nA: It seems like you've covered almost everything, but what I would do is start with the RAM. You said haven't changed it and RAM problems typically leave the computer somewhat functional, like how it will startups, but soon crash. I can personally recommend OWC for Mac replacement parts, but wherever you go, just make sure to buy Mac-specific RAM; I've had a terrible experience with Best Buy, one-size-fits-all RAM.\nIf that doesn't do it, it almost has to be the logic board, but don't go there first, as it should cost you more than RAM.\n", "Q: prevent preview.app from automatically starting slideshow when switching to fullscreen view I read a lot of PDF files in preview. Whenever I open a file, switch to fullscreen to have a view in which I can focus on reading the PDF without being distracted, after 5 seconds, preview.app goes to the second page. I understand that this is great for photos. At the same time, it's really stupid for PDF files with lots of text. So this function should either be file format sensitive or if that is too much to ask for apple to implement, there should be an option to disable auto-play for fullscreen view.\nI was unable to find such an option in the preferences for preview.app. Am I the only one reading PDFs in fullscreen and annoyed by this behavior?

I usually log in to OS X El Capitan without administrator rights. Homebrew upholds the principle that packages can be installed and used without administrator/root access, i.e. without using the sudo command.\nHowever, it seems that administrator access is necessary for installing Homebrew. Running the script from my normal non-admin user's Terminal yields\n\nThis script requires the user [user] to be an Administrator. If this\n  sucks for you then you can install Homebrew in your home directory or\n  however you please; please refer to our homepage. If you still want to\n  use this script set your user to be an Administrator in System\n  Preferences or `su' to a non-root user with Administrator privileges.\n\nFirst, unfortunately, the homepage does not say much more about how to install in my home directory and what difference that actually makes from the usual way to install.\nSecond, running 'su' and entering my password yields\n\nsu: Sorry\n\nThen, running 'sudo su' yields\n\n[user] is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.\n\nThis did not feel right, either. (See also Why can't I run `su`? (and how should I do?))\nThird, I simply opened a shell with my administrator account 'login [user-admin]' to install Homebrew. But when I later tried to install a package as the normal non-admin user/ran 'brew doctor', I did get a number of errors about directories not being writable. Again, a fix is suggested at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14527521/brew-doctor-says-warning-usr-local-include-isnt-writable but I was not too sure whether there is only one /usr/local on my computer, or whether there is one for every user so that the directories in question would actually be those of my admin user (and thus it might be weird to give my non-admin user access to those). Also, it were quite many directories (more than 10) which made me suspicous.\nForth, and finally, what I did was to give my non-admin user administrator rights, installed as that user, and then made the user a normal, non-admin user again.\nNow, everything seems to be OK, but I wonder whether this was actually the/a correct way, since the script error quoted above didn't actually say whether I need to permanently have Administrator priviledges, or whether it is OK to only take them during the installation process of Homebrew itself.\n\nA: The normal way to do things is as per your third choice ie use an admin account to install things.\nHowever Homebrew's normal setup does not stick to normal Unix conventions of installing excutables as root or a special user which would allow equal access of the installed code to all users, it is designed so that you do installs as one user and so do not need to use sudo/su for anything. However to do this it needs to make /usr/local writeable by the normal user and you need admin rights to that as in the way you did in the end. I think Homebrew really is designed for a computer which only one person uses and has admin rights.\nIf you do not want to (or cannot) set your user to admin then there are two ways\n\n\n*\n\n*As per the instructions you quote \"If this sucks for you then you can install Homebrew in your home directory\" Then the access to ~/usr/local is always for the user\n\n*A version of your 3. The Homebrew script leaves /usr/local and all under it owned by the user doing the installation. With the admin user you can change the owner to your normal user by chown -R usr /usr/local\nYes there is only one /usr/local in the file system. Each path is unique. The way to have the \"same\" directory for different users is to put the directories under your home directory e.g. ~/usr/local\n", "Q: Should I upgrade my iPad 2 to iOS 9.3 from iOS 5.1.1?

I cannot afford a new tablet at the moment and I will use my iPad 2 as a daily driver (to browse the web, read books, college lectures, play games and other light applications). My biggest concern is that the iPad might become unusably slow with iOS 9. It runs smoothly with iOS 5 at the moment but most of the applications are not compatible and many features are not functioning (mail etc.). \n\nA: This Wikipedia Page states that \"Although the A5-based iPad 2 is relatively archaic, showing signs of its age in iOS 8, iOS 9 is said to feature performance improvements that may help the aging device function more smoothly, and initial tests suggest that it did not significantly impact available space.\"\nI upgraded three iPad2s last week, and did not notice any degradation in the short time I had for testing.

Try using AirPort Utility to check the speeds you are getting from the AirPort Express. Go to AirPort Utility -> Base Station -> Logs and Statistics -> Wireless Clients. Then, check the box called \"Tx Rate.\" You'll see 130-270 for 802.11n, and < 56 for 802.11g. This will tell you what type of connection you are getting on your extended networks--i.e., 802.11a/b/g/n/ac.

UserB & UserC are added as family members. UserA & UserB had previous purchases, different to each other. UserC is new & 'virgin' but is the new Family Organiser account.  \nUserC can regain any & all previous purchases made by Users A & B, but will lose account-specific data such as email [including the userA@icloud.com account entirely], iMessages, any game progress or reading bookmarks etc they had prior to the 'handover', as they all still belong to UserA.  \nSimilarly for UserB, but they will retain their existing user-specific data on existing apps etc.\n", "Q: I deleted the update file for iOS 9.3. Is it possible to reinstall it? I was having trouble installing the new iOS 9.3 on my iPhone 5 and I got the advice that I should delete the update file and try to reinstall it. The problem is now that I have deleted the file I can't find the update file for iOS 9.3 again. I have restarted the phone but it didn't help, it says I have the latest update (9.2.1). Is it possible to install iOS 9.3 now?\nUpdate: I got the new update today randomly. The installation of 9.3 went successfull.\n\nA: Apple has pulled the iOS 9.3 update for some (older) devices because of a bug that could prevent using your device. Apple is not signing iOS 9.3 for your iPhone (5s and older), so it is not possible to update by official means at this time. According to the link below, 9.3 could potentially brick an older phone under certain conditions. \nSource: http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/24/bricked-iphone-5s-5-ipad-2-ios-9-3-fix/\n\nA: Several sites host the ipsw file for 9.3.  That's similar to a zip file but it's for ios.  You can do a simple google search for sites but you need to be careful and make sure the file hasn't been messed with.  I often go to OSXDaily.com to get my files.  From there you can download the 9.3 file and install it following the instructions. This will update your iPhone to 9.3.\n", "Q: I lost my iphone I lost my iPhone my phone is in offline so my friend search in find my iPhone but when he alert it in lost mode it never became online what can I do?\n\nA: You can check your service provider to see the last location it detected your phone in, and you can search that area. Unfortunately, if your iPhone is offline there is nothing you can do to find its currently location.\nRead the procedure listed here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201472 for information on how to report your iPhone as lost and what to do (change passwords, etc.).\n", "Q: Find Differences between Time Machine backups I would like to list all the changes between 2 backups in Time Machines for a specific drive. Is there anyway to do it?\n\nA: Timedog is a perl script that will list the files which were updated in a particular backup. It doesn't show files that were deleted, though. \n\nA: I found Gordon Davisson's answer very helpful.\nAs I still ran into a problem (on macOS Mojave), I'd like to mention a setting I had to adjust before I could use tmutil compare properly, as it just gave me the following output when I tried to compare two backups:\n$ tmutil compare /Volumes/BackupVolume/... /Volumes/BackupVolume/...\n-------------------------------------\nAdded:         0B\nRemoved:       0B\nChanged:       0B\n\ntmutil listbackups gave me the answer to my problem:\n$ tmutil listbackups\nThe operation could not be completed because tmutil could not access\nprivate application data on the backup disk. Use the Privacy tab\nin the Security and Privacy preference pane to add Terminal to the\nlist of applications which can access Application Data.\n\nSo if you add your terminal application to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access tmutil compare should work fine for you.\n\nA: The tmutil command-line tool has a compare option that does this. Just give it the file paths to the two snapshot folders on the backup volume, and it does the rest. The paths get rather long, so it's easier to cd to the backup parent, then just specify the snapshots. For example, compare the March 27 2016 10:11:12am and March 26 5:43:21pm snapshots of a computer named \"Ipinak's Mac\", on a backup volume named \"Backup Disk\", you'd use:\ncd \"/Volumes/Backup Disk/Backups.backupdb/Ipinak's Mac\"\ntmutil compare 2016-03-27-101112 2016-03-26-174321\n\n", "Q: Macbook pro (Retina 15 inch Late 2013) Horizontal gray line across screen I have bought this computer New at the Apple Store in 2014.\nSince yesterday it's showing horizontal gray lines across the screen. I suspect a hardware defect because that's how my 2 others macs older started showing problems too.\nAll updates are installed and restarted the computer a few times. \nAnyone would know if this is really an hardware issue? If it is probably looks at very expensive repair.\n\n\nA: This is definitely a hardware defect, because, as Tetsujin mentioned, the lines do not show up on the picture. I would suggest going to an Apple retail store or otherwise the store you bought the Macbook to get it checked up. Are you still under warranty/AppleCare?\n", "Q: Is there any software like 'Primo Cache'? I've used PrimoCache on Windows.\nSpecifically Defer Write feature not only for performance, \nI've used it for drive endurance.\nAs a switcher from Windows to Mac, I can handle RamDisk thing now, but I can't find alternatives to this software or feature on OS X.\n\nA: Apple's Fusion Drive technology encompasses some of what PrimoCache does, in addition to the design of the filesystem itself. Tetsujin's comment is right on. Apple's disk interface is well thought out, robustly designed, and doesn't need any external 'aids' to caching disks for performance sake.\n\nA: PrimoCache is a more advanced solution. It can't be compared with Apple's very limited \"Fusion Drive\" technology. PrimoCache provides automatic L1 (RAM) and L2 (SSD) caching and doesn't \"shuffle\" blocks like Fusion Drive. Also, it is multi-device, you can use it with a large JBOD or RAID setup. This isn't about robustness, Windows also has built-in caching in various forms, similar to macOS' ones.\nI'm also looking for some kind of solution like PrimoCache for macOS operating system. Fusion Drive is similar, but I need the extended functionality.\n", "Q: Stop full screen alerts on my Apple Watch I would like to know how I can still be alerted to a notification (eg. Getting a tap when a message arrives) but it not necessarily being what I see when I look at my Apple Watch. \nI'd prefer to see the watch face with a red dot above it. \nIt's very disconcerting to look at your watch to see the time, but get a full screen alert instead. \nIs this possible?\nThanks!\n\nA: The closest feature to what you're describing is called Notification Privacy, and it lets you get a quick summary when you twist your wrist instead of the full notification. From the Apple Watch user guide:\n\nWhen you raise your wrist to see a notification, you get a quick summary,\n  then full details a few seconds later. For example, when a message arrives, you see who it’s from first, then the message appears. To stop the full notification from appearing unless you tap it, open the Apple Watch app on iPhone, tap My Watch, tap Notifications, then turn on Notification Privacy.\n\nOtherwise, you can turn off Apple Watch notifications for specific apps in the Apple Watch app.\n", "Q: Inserting a formula in Pages is not possible I would like to insert a formula in a Pages document (under El Capitan). But when I chose Insert -> Formula in the menu all entries in the submenu all entries are greyed out. Also Insert -> MathType equation is greyed out.\nDo I need to install further software to have the options available?\nClarification\nI am looking for a way to typeset a mathematical formula in a document (i.e., a kind of formula editor). Does any tool like this come together with Apple's office tool?\n\nA: Functions and formulas can only be inserted into table cells. So, you have to insert a table first. If needed, the table can be configured in the Table section of the Inspector to consist of only a single cell: 1 row, 1 column, 0 header. Also, the table can be set to have no border stroke/line. \nIf you are in a word processing document and want to position the table/formula freely on the page, you need to set the table to be a floating object (Inspector: Object Placement).\n(This answer is based on Pages version 4.3, but might apply in principle to newer versions as well.) \nUser manual for Pages 5.5: http://help.apple.com/pages/mac/5.5/#/tana41710df7\n\nA: To insert a formula in normal text you need to download and install MathType.  Then that menu option should be available.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro mid 2012 13.3 HDD cable performance I am helping a friend to fix her MacBook Pro 13.3 performance problems.\nIt was barely booting, and terribly slow for disk seeks. Then I replaced the HDD.\nIt was perfect with new SSD and El Capitan installation but in the third boot it become same bad as before.\nIt is so weird but I realized when I disconnect the HDD cable for a while then reconnect it, it works good for 3-4 boots then it become extremely slow again. I know that this model has a cable problem but I can't understand what kind of problem is this. I thought it could be a firmware problem and I don't want to waste money on buying a new expensive cable.\nAny advises on that?\n\nA: There have been HDD cable issues with every model of non-Retina MacBook Pro (13-inch). This includes the Mid-2009 model, all the way to the Mid-2012 (today's model).\nThe fix is to simply replace the cable. You can find them all over the place, and it just requires a small cross-head screwdriver.\nThe issue is thought to be related to the cable weakening and losing contact with the socket on the board. In fact, Apple recommends installing small rubber pads on the hard drive cable after replacement.\nIf an Apple technician replaces the cable for you, that should be included. If you order the part elsewhere, the pads may come with it. You can see that demonstrated in this picture.\nI recommend following iFixit's guide and ordering the part there. It will save you a lot of headaches with intermittent hard drive issues if you leave the cable as-is.\n", "Q: How to Uninstall System Apps by AppCleaner? I know there is the graphical method by which you can individually remove each system app such as Chess, Safari, Mail, Game Center, Photo Booth, FaceTime, iBooks, iTunes, Maps, Dictionary, Automator, Notes, Messages, and ImageCapture. \nHowever, this is taking too much time and I would like to control their removal better because my SSDs are only 120 GB and I need more space. \nI am considering the application AppCleaner enough smart capable of doing the process because it can well decide which is a system app and what is not. \nSo the thing what remains is to make the system apps look like normal apps, probably. \nA terminal approach would probably be most appropriate if not possible otherwise. \nI would like leave the removal of those applications for AppCleaner in the end. \nI see these locks on the icons of my systems apps in AppCleaner\n\nSpace taken by OS X applications\nI run patrix's command\nsudo du -sm /Applications/{Chess,Safari,Mail,FaceTime,iBooks,iTunes,Maps,Dictionary,Automato‌​r,Notes,Messages,ImageCapture}.app\n\nI get \n5   /Applications/Chess.app\n40  /Applications/Safari.app\n28  /Applications/Mail.app\n4   /Applications/FaceTime.app\n27  /Applications/iBooks.app\n219 /Applications/iTunes.app\n8   /Applications/Maps.app\n12  /Applications/Dictionary.app\ndu: /Applications/Automato‌​r.app: No such file or directory\n6   /Applications/Notes.app\n16  /Applications/Messages.app\n\nwhere you see that I close more than 300 Mb because of them. \nThat is too much with my 128 GB SSD. \n\nHow can you remove system apps by AppCleaner?\n\nA: The remove the locks so that you can delete macOS system apps go to\nAppCleaner -> Preferences -> General Tab\nand Uncheck \"protect default OSX Apps\"\nI just cleaned up garageband from macOS Sierra 10.12.5 which was shown as locked (system protected app) as shown in your image.\nEDIT: As @leo said, please be warned that removing some system app like messages might break/ crash a whole set of applications or even the entire OS.

There is also black thermal paste between the chip and shield. I have the grey thermal paste for computer processors and heatsinks, but I don't have, nor have I seen, the black paste being sold. Can I use the grey thermal paste with the A8, without it overheating and with it working long term?\n\nA: The article Thermal Paste Thermal Tape Question Logic Board mentions a similar black substance used in a G4 PowerBook logic board:\n\nWhen installing the logic board, I know your're required to use the silver colored thermal paste on the main processor and it's heat sink. On the other chip however, ( I assume it's the video chip, it says Motorola on it), the original techs appear to have used something black, and it is thicker, and harder to remove and appears to be cut to size. My question is,...what is the black stuff used on the other processor with a copper heat sink? Is it black thermal tape, cut to size and if so, where do you buy it from? And do you apply a piece of tape on the video processor and on the copper heat sink? Or do you apply the thermal substance on only only one part either the video chip or the copper heat sink?\n\nUnfortunately, as you mention, there appears to be no source for the black thermal substance1. However, silver (which has an extra 5% efficiency) thermal paste, rather than white , should do the trick.\n\n1 Unless this Thermal paste for iPhone 5 Mainboard is the black stuff.\n", "Q: Can I change icon for an app and how? I have XAMPP on my Mac with El Capitan and the icon is strange and I don't like it. It is not the same one as I am used to, on my other computer running WIndows. How can I change it?\n\nA: You can edit any icon by right-clicking (control-clicking) the application, choosing Get Info, and dragging the replacement icon over the original icon at the top of the window that appears.\nYou can also copy and paste the image you'd like to use as an icon, as mentioned in Apple's documentation.\nThis works for files or folders you'd like to change the icon for.\n\nA: HyperSwitch, apparently, uses a different way to get app icon; regular way won't work with it.\nWith HyperSwitch, you'll have to manually overwrite /Applications/<the_app>/Resources/<whatever>.icns with your own file.\nDo it only after the app was launched at least once, because replacing a file changes the app's checksum. If it doesn't match the one from app signature, it won't pass macOS' initial security check.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13in Late 2012 v.s.

It's like the little cloud istead of the open.  Is that normal?\n\nA: Yes, it is perfectly normal. It signifies that the apple account that you are currently using has previously \"purchased\" the app. Note that you may not have actually purchased the app, in the case of so called \"free\" apps.\nThe link what does the cloud icon mean in the app store provides some links to Download your past purchases and iCloud.\n\nA: It's normal.

I use Notes on my iPhone, iPad and Macbook Pro. Of late, the gmail syncing has been unreliable.

If later I remove X from my Family account, would I still be able to download apps later from iTunes purchases that X had purchased? Or will it be only available to X who brought the app in the first place?\nAlso, if I add X to my Family account, would I be able to download the apps that X has purchased while X is still in Family Sharing?\n\nA: I feel Apple has some corporate greed issues with their Family Sharing feature that they designed.  The system locks your credit card in, you can't remove it, which negatively impacts families budgets.  I will detail below.\nFirst let me answer your questions:\nIn your first question, the latter part is true: purchases by person X will only be available to person X.  This is according to the Leave Family Sharing article on the Apple Support site.\nUnder the section:  What happens to your content when you stop sharing? it says\n\nAny content that your family shared with you isn't automatically removed from your device. You can purchase it again or remove it to free up space on your device. If you downloaded an app from a family member’s purchase history and made In-App Purchases, you'll need to purchase the app yourself to access your In-App Purchases.\nAny DRM-protected music, movies, TV shows, books, or apps that you previously downloaded from other family member's collections will no longer be usable, and other family members won't be able to use content downloaded from your collection.\n\nIn your second question - the answer is Yes - apps are shared within the Family.\nHowever, I recommend you do not turn on Family Sharing for 2 reasons:\n\n*\n\n*You have to enter a credit card to turn on Family Sharing.  Once you do this, your payment method cannot later be switched to None (i.e - you can't remove your credit card!) without turning off Family Sharing...oh how nice....\n\n\n*So lets turn off Family Sharing, should be easy enough.  Well, not if you have a child on your Family Sharing that is under 13.  You can't turn off Family Sharing if there is a child on your account under 13.  So now you are stuck verifying your credit card all the time, because you can't ever remove it.\nThe Family Sharing hurts families budgets because, kids are kids and get the password and make purchases and rack up the bill.  So you want to remove the credit card, but you are restricted by Apple, because a credit card is a requirement for Family Sharing.  And you can't turn off family sharing if you have a child under 13. So you are stuck.\nIt shouldn't be this hard to remove the credit card, yet it is.  Shame on Apple - it feels like they have you and your credit card trapped in their system.\n", "Q: Infinite Time Machine Backup on Apple Time Capsule I've got a (old \"flat\" version) 1TB Apple Time Capsule and I've configured my Macbook Pro (running El Capitan) to backup data on the Time Capsule, through Time Machine.\nFrom the top-right information on the menu bar, I can see that backup is working fine. Nevertheless, after backupping almost 2x the size of my hard drive in about 10 days (I'm not always attached to the network and I send to sleep my MBP during night), the first backup is not completed yet.\nThe bad part is that backup information shown in the menu bar display increasing full backup size: if currently remaining backup size is about 5GB, in an hour it is almost the same size, since it continuously increases.

The seller says it's broken and when he press the power button it shows a white/grey screen and the \"startup sound\" plays.\nIs there any chance that this may be a motherboard/logic board, CPU, memory or GPU related issue?\nOr will I most likely be able to fix it with a fresh install on a new drive?\n\nA: You know the old saying:  \"If you have to ask....\"\nIt could be any/all of those things.  If it was a grey screen with a flashing question mark, your chances would be very good that it was just something a hard drive and a OS reinstall would fix.\n\nBut seeing that you (or the seller) didn't mention this, it could be something more.  Then again, it could be nothing.  That's the problem with buying these things sight unseen - you are rolling the dice.\nIf you can get the seller to run Apple Diagnostics (hold down D  while powering on) and select \"Extended Tests\"  It will run through a battery of tests and then provide you with a diagnostic report.\nThe downside to this is that you've just shown all the cards to the seller which might now change the price.\nNow, while I can't give you a definitive technical answer, I can share with you some of my personal experience:\nMy daughter has a 13\" 2014 MacBook Air which she spilled milk on (trust me, I cried).

Whenever I switch between work and home,  every now and again I get bug whereby the Mac thinks an external monitor is still plugged in, even if it's not.\nThis means when I go to plug in either my work or home monitors, one of them doesn't work as OS X still thinks there is a different monitor plugged in.\nThe only way I've been able to fix this is to restart, but I was hoping there was a quick way to fix this through a terminal command or something.\nNote that System Preferences > Displays > Option + Detect Displays does not work.\n\nA: I'm so glad to have found this thread !\nI have the same issue, and in fact with the exact same configuration BlkPengu has: a MacBook Pro 16\" (2019) and an LG 34\" widescreen. (A great combination, BTW.)\nI deliver a lot of presentations and courses, connecting various projectors and screens to my MacBook. And back at home, not always but e.g. once in 3 to 4 times, the system still thinks the earlier display is still connected. My LG is also detected but at the resolution of the former !\nThe SwitchResX tool helped me discover that in such an instance, there are in fact THREE displays (falsely) being detected: the MacBook's built-in, an earlier connected display like a projector or presentation screen, and the physically connected LG, showing up as a 'ghost' display. So the system is strangely still aware of the recently connected projector with a certain resolution, while the LG is also detected but getting the signal and resolution of the assumed other external display.\nUsing the plain Display Preference panel (or with special option-invoked settings) won't work. Even the most drastic Rotate setting doesn't do the trick. The only solution is to completely Restart.\nBelow two samples of a settings panel in SwitchResX:\n\n\nI expected that it might be possible to 'kick' the system's display sensing routine, but SwitchResX's developer Stépahne Madrau investigated the issue last week, and said this isn't something a user can fix with available tools or user-friendly hacks. It's definitely a system bug or flaw, which needs to be addressed by a system update.\nWith this information, I'm going to ask Apple what I need to do with this.\nI'll notify you all ASAP when I get some response.\n\nA: Go into System Preferences->Displays and when there (doesn't matter which tab) press the 'Option/ALT' key and you'll see 'Detect Displays' where the 'Gather Windows' button is (on 10.13.x) or simply in the lower right on 10.14.x (as this page doesn't have a 'Gather Windows' button.)\n\nA: If you can't see you display, want MacOS to 'Detect Displays' you can try:\n[Option]-[F1/BrightnessUp Key]  # brings up the display preferences\n[tab] x 6                       # moves focus to 'Gather Windows' Button\nhold [Option]                   # changes Gather Windows to 'Detect Display'\n[Space Bar]                     # trigger detect displays\n\n\nA: Since at least OS X El Capitan (Version 11.x), you can force Detect Displays using Command-IncreaseBrightness (Cmd-F2 key on MacBook Pro, or Cmd-fn-F2 if you have function keys turned on).\nI had a similar problem with my 13\" MBP, where when I disconnected an external display it didn't detect that it should switch to the single, built-in display – regardless of whether the machine was already sleeping or the lid were quickly closed. Cmd-F2 worked for forcing the machine to detect that the only available display was the built-in one.\nAs a bonus, you can also toggle Display Mirroring using Cmd-DecreaseBrightness (Cmd-F1...). Hit it again to toggle back.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: As of macOS Catalina, the only option to get ride of the \"ghost\" display is to restart your machine. I've tried every method I could find online and in the end the only thing that worked is a full restart.

Am I safe? Should I factory reset?\n\nA: You are not safe. Your personal documents, contacts, and private information are at risk. \nThe behaviour you are seeing is not part of Apple's Final Cut Pro. The odd terminal like behaviour suggests you do have a rogue process or application on your Mac.\nSearch for a guide about how to remove malware and viruses from your Mac.\n\nA: The same behavior happened to me even though it was a validly signed copy of Final Cut Pro.\nRun spctl on the app using spctl --assess --verbose /path/to/app in Terminal.

But it doesn't appear in the updates page of the App Store. So, I searched for Xcode in the App Store and clicked the little update button. The button remains pressed and a loop icon appears on the top. But it stays like that for hours and there's no sign it's updating.\n\nThis doesn't seem to be working. I found in the internet that if I uninstall and reinstall it may work, but I don't want to lose all my projects.\n\nA: In my case, I just had to upgrade to the latest macOS, since Xcode 7.3 requires El Capitan, just as Tetsujin pointed out.\n\nA: Yes I always found updating Xcode from the App Store a painful experience.\nAssuming you have an Apple ID*, you can bypass App Store and download it directly using this Apple Developer link and then find the version of Xcode you need.\nAs @Tetsujin says, also ensure you have an appropriate version of macOS to support the version of Xcode you are going to be running.\n\n*\n\n*What is the correct version of xcode for mojave 10.14.4\nNote: * You no longer need a developer account, although you may want to consider this depending on the type of development you are going to be doing. See this Apple Developer page for details and links to create the appropriate account types. Note that you can start with a free Apple ID and upgrade later as necessary.\n\nA: For Xcode 11.2.1, I had to use Safari to download it from the Apple Developer website. Chrome would only download the first 1.7GB, and the update didn't appear in the App Store.\nApple Developer downloads: https://developer.apple.com/download/more/\nDirect link to 11.2.1 GM: https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_11.2.1_GM_Seed/Xcode_11.2.1_GM_Seed.xip\n\nA: This can happen with any app if you have formerly downloaded the same app (i.e. With the same internal \"bundle id\") from outside the App Store. \nSimply move the app to the Trash, restart the App Store app and try downloading the app again.\nTrashing an app does never make you lose your settings or even project. This is not Windows (where Uninstallers are common - but even those often offer an option not to delete your data) ;)\n\nA: Provided you have the correct MacOS updated (usually latest) do the following.\nWhen you have app store app loaded in your mac, go to \"Store\" in the upper menu and then select \"Reload Page\". It will then show you the xcode update in the content page.\n\nA: One thing I've found is that if an app is showing with a circle in the updates and not progressing is that a reboot will often fix it - had it with Xcode 12.1 which had been stuck for a week.\n", "Q: Why is Xcode 7.3 showing a slash through the app icon when attempting to install on Mac OS X 10.10.5 (Yosemite) I am running Xcode 7.2.1 on my Mac mini running Mac OS X 10.10.5 (Yosemite) and recently wanted to compile an Apache Cordova project and install it on my iPhone 6s running iOS 9.3 and discovered I couldn’t. The error message that comes up in Xcode is “Could not find Developer Disk Image” which I discovered basically means, “Time to get a new version of Xcode!”\nSo I went to the downloads area of the Apple Developer website, downloaded the disk image of Xcode 7.3 opened it up and saw this in the Finder window for the Xcode disk image pictured below. What the heck is happening?\n\n\nA: It turns out that Xcode 7.3 requires Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) or higher to run see screenshot below from the Mac App Store but the same idea for either install method.\nOh well. Been nice knowing you Yosemite!\nAs one can see from this question I posted a little while back I’m fairly cautious with my core OS upgrades so I jumped to Mac OS X 10.10 when El Capitan was released just to not be too far behind the curve.

Password protected, not seen When I boot to safe mode and try to restore my Mac from Time Machine, OS X can't find my WD My Passport External Drive as it's password protected. Unless I unlock the drive, OS X won't be able to access my Time Machine Backup. So what do I do now?\n\nA: Unlocking the WD My Passport External Drive probably neither works in Safe Mode nor in Recovery Mode because a custom 256-bit AES hardware encryption is used. The decryption/unlocking only works with WD Security for Mac or WD Drive Utilities for Mac installed.\nYou have to boot to Recovery Mode (hold cmdR while booting) erase your main OS X volume and reinstall OS X. \n\n\n*\n\n*Now you can either migrate the data with the Migration Asssistant:\nMake a temporary admin user (different short user name than your backup) and then install the WD Security software. Then you can run Migration Assistant to read the files from the now-unlocked drive.\nOnce your migration is complete, you can leave things as they are or decrypt the WD drive and instead use Apple's encryption. That is supported at boot time so you don't have to do a dance when you erase and reinstall.\nIf you do that, the steps will be simply reboot to Recovery Mode and restore the Time Machine backup.\n\n*or use Time Machine to completely restore the Time Machine backup:\nInstall the WD Security software and completely remove encryption of the WD My Passport.

I also tried closing all open applications. Still same result.\nAny ideas on how to get the update installed?  \n\nA: Installing via iTunes works (i.e., plug iPad into computer with iTunes running), so I ended up doing that.  \nFor others that run into this problem: you may want to make sure you have enough disk space on your device. I had 32gb, so I know that wasn't my problem.  \nI suspect my problem had something to do with the 9.3 update arriving, and then Apple unsigning it because of its bugs; and maybe when 9.3.1 came out, my iPad was confused?  shrugs\n", "Q: Create a snapshot of Mac that I can restore from What is the easiest way to create a snapshot of my Mac at its current state that I can use to do future re-installs from.  \nI want to be able to get my Mac back to a state where all my required apps are set up with their required settings and plugins and all my system settings are set to a state I'm happy with.\n\nA: You can indeed go into recovery mode and use Disk Utility to image your drive to another location (like an attached USB drive or the like.\nThere are also 3rd party programs (SuperDuper, Carbon Copy Cloner, and others) that will make a bootable image of your drive to either a DISK image (think multiple copies) or directly to another drive so that drive is bootable. The advantage of these is that they can do it on a live system without booting into recovery mode.

I've a 15-inch MacBook Pro and a 21-inch All-in-one Windows Computer.\nHowever, I haven't any HDMI or DisplayPort cable but Ethernet.\nI would like to transfer the Mac's desktop to the larger computer display, if possible with the native resolution of the latter (1920x1080), with a keyboard and mouse plugged on the Mac to control it. It is possible, just with LAN or Ethernet? If yes, how?\n\nA: AirServer might be worth a try. It's an AirPlay receiver for Mac and PC. So as long as both computers are in the same network, it should allow you to stream your MBP screen through AirPlay to your Windows computer.\nI'm not exactly sure how it will handle resolutions though.\n", "Q: How can I backup a VirtualBox VM with TimeMachine I've read lots of different things about using TimeMachine with VirtualBox, but I haven't been able to find a very clear answer about what an acceptable configuration is. Some folks say \"include up the whole virtual disk\", some say \"use snapshots and include everything except the virtual disk\", and other people say \"forget TimeMachine, create a separate partition on you backup drive, and export you VMs manually\". I've read that including the whole VBox vdi / vdmk will cause TimeMachine to write the whole disk each time something changes, filling up the TimeMachine backup & wiping out all of the incremental backup history.\nMost of the things I've read are a few years old too. I'm wondering if anyone has any new advice on this. What is the best way to back up VirtualBox VMs using TimeMachine? Is it even a task worth messing with, or is manually backing up the better option?\n\nA: I have an answer, it's not the answer but it just recently saved my posterior when my iMac's HDD crashed a few weeks ago so I thought I would share.  It's not a short read, but I think it can help.\nThere are many issues around VM's that can cause headaches for backup strategies - size of the VDI files, snapshots, backup time, etc.  Consequently, I decided to chart my own path here to make things simplier.\nI avoid the \"putting all your eggs in one basket\" strategy.  What this means is that while I have a VM running FreeBSD for web development, what get's developed is nowhere on the VM.  Here's a map of what my environment looks like:\n\nThe graphic needs to be updated because I no longer run Oracle Linux 7 as I have switched to FreeBSD 10-2.  I also have 4 USB drives attached to the Synology, not just one.  But those are minor and the concepts are still exactly the same.  Following is how I put it all together...\nThe Architecture\nMy environment consists of my \n\n\n*\n\n*Synology NAS (RAID 1) with an iSCSI Target configured to hold all the data for the FreeBSD VM\n\n*a USB drive to backup that iSCSI LUN\n\n*a cron job on the Synology to take daily snapshots of the dev directory (this includes a daily MySQL dump)\n\n\nOn my iMac\n\n\n*\n\n*a dynamically sized VDI that maxes out at 24GB\n\n*FreeBSD VM configured how I like, updated will all the latest patches and updates\n\n*FreeBSD VM \"bridged\" so it appears as a node on my network and not NAT'ed behind VirtualBox\n\n*iSCSI Initiator that connects to the Synology iSCSI LUN\n\n*the VM autoboot set to enabled so that it will automatically boot the VM across reboots\n\n*Time Machine configured to backup once per day\n\n\nHow This Works\nBecause I have an iSCSI target mapped to my FreeBSD VM, anything I do is changed on the Synology, not the VM itself.  As far as FreeBSD is concerned, it's just another mount point.  In this case, I created a mount point\n/mnt/web/http/htdocs    -----> Synology iqn.diskstion.local-some-name\nWhy iSCSI?  iSCSI is block level, not file level.  As far as the OS can tell, you have attached another hard disk to your OS.  You format and partition it the same way you would any drive you added to your system.\nI then changed the DocumentRoot in httpd.conf to the aforementioned directory.  Now, if you point  your browser to the web server being hosted on my iMac, all the files are coming from the Synology and just passing through the VM. If I write new code, it's on the Synology.  \nOh...the MySQL data directory...you guessed it...on the Synology!\nBacking Up\nOnce I created the FreeBSD VM the way I liked it, I immediately archived a copy and put it on the Synology and on a USB stick.  It was only 4GB, by the way.\nI tested out the restore procedure by deleting the VM on my iMac and then copying it back to my iMac's VM directory.  The trick is, instead of Importing/Exporting, you just \"Add\" it to VirtualBox and \"Open\" the .vbox file of the machine you copied over. \n\nNow, my FreeBSD image was only 4GB and it never changes - unless of course I do an update.  So, there isn't a need to back this up with Time Machine (unless I want to) because it only changes when I do an OS update.\nThe Synology is configured with a RAID 1, so the disks are mirrored.  If one fails, then I still have the other; that my first level of data protection.  I also have a daily backup going to a USB drive;  that's my second level.  I also do a daily directory snapshot using tar and mysqldump that's cron'd (on the Synology); third level.  Synology has the ability to sync to cloud providers so in effect, if I set this up, there is now 4 levels of data protection available to me.  Buy another NAS and use rsync...5 levels...and so on....\nHow this Worked\nSo earlier I said that this saved my bacon when my HDD crashed.  Because my data existed on another drive, it was safe.  I had my VM image backed up in two places so that was at the ready.\nWhen I copied my VM back to my new iMac, once I loaded it up, it knew where the iSCSI target was and immediately went to work.  I restored in less than 10 minutes total and that's including the time to find and copy the VM master image over to my new iMac.\nBut that's not where it saved my bacon...\nI chose to upgrade to a 1TB SSD and delivery would take 2 days.  I couldn't be down for two days, so I copied the VM to my Surface Pro 3, loaded it up, and because  the VM \"knew\" where the Synology iSCSI target was, I was back up in business in 10 mins  on a completely different computer.  \nYou don't need an external NAS\nOk, so maybe my setup is a bit overkill with an NAS and iSCSI.  However, there is nothing to prevent you from setting up a \"shared directory\" on your Mac and sharing it via NFS and mounting it on your VM. Remember, the VM is setup to be it's own node on the network; it has no idea that it's looping back to the shared drive where it's getting it's data from. With this setup you can still get the benefit of the VM never changing and only backing up what has changed which would be what's in the directory being shared via NFS.\nConclusion\nI have always subscribed to the philosophy that data protection is not a product or service you buy; it's a strategy you employ.  I found that relying on one thing (i.e. Time Machine) is a disaster waiting to happen.  By building this as levels of protection I can be very efficient as well as highly backed up incase of disaster.  It also allows me to be extremely flexible and \"rapid\" in coming back online.\n\nA: Just make sure the virtual box folders aren't on your excluded backup list (open system preferences-> time machine-> options) and time machine will do the rest. \nAfter a complete time machine backup you can enter time machine and verify the virtual machine folders are present in time machine. \nEDIT: Time Machine backups files at the file level so if you change a single bit on a 30GB *.vdi file Time machine will make a complete copy of the new file as well as storing the old, so yes your assumption the TC will duplicate lots of data is correct, but as additional space is required older version will be overwritten. I would imagine if your TC drive is at least twice your OS X drive you should never have a conflict\nAs for VM files being corrupted, if you power off the VMs correctly(not save), then you should be fine.\nSee this VMWare link, its applicable to Virtual Box. As a side note the only time I've ever had a problem restoring a VM from backup or moving a VM is when it was in a saved state during the move, that seems to mess them up everytime.\n\nA: It's pretty easy to use Time Machine to go in and delete all backups of a specific file, so I say - let it back up your machine and gather some data.\n\n\n*\n\n*How large is your backup drive?\n\n*How much space does the VM use for one snapshot?\n\n*Can you use settings on VirtualBox to minimize the new space needed as the VM writes data to it's drive image(s)?\n\n\nA back of the envelope calculation would show that in a month - you would have 24 hourly backups of the VM files, 31 daily backups. So if each backup makes a completely new image of the entire drive image - you'd have 55x the storage on Time Machine as the storage on your Mac.\nIf you make 20 GB of drive space total from Virtual Box VM, that's 1.1 TB on the backup. Not insignificant, but not a worry at all if you have 3+ TB free space to experiment with.\nThen after a few days, you could use a tool like BackupLoupe to estimate how long it will take for the drive to fill and inspect whether your VM are using space efficiently or if its causing delays in the backup completion and/or even making a viable backup (you'd have to restore the image to test).\n", "Q: How to get Cascading Folder Browser in Dock or Menu?

Or do I just have to go through manually and remove them as I encounter them?\n\nA: Here's a work-around I found:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a playlist in iTunes and call it whatever you want (I called\nmine \"existing songs\").\n\n*Go to your \"All Songs\" view, select your entire library, and drag it into the \"existing songs\" playlist. iTunes will not add missing songs to this playlist, which means \"existing songs\" will only include songs without an exclamation point.\n\n*Create a new smart playlist with the rule \"Playlist is not\nexisting songs\".

I just bought an external hard drive (Seagate Backup Plus Slim 2 TB) for my Mac (Yosemite installed) for professional photography. \nI wanted to make partitions for both Mac and Windows, but it only allows for Mac. I think as I tried so many time. So I put Basic device (2 TB) on Mac (Mac OS Extended (Journaled)) and then made two partition, one just for the Mac (Mac OS Extended (Journaled) 500 GB) and main one (photos 1.5 TB) for Mac and PC. \nI wanted to connect it to a TV also. But unfortunately it isn't detected there. I think because the basic drive is formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Is it? How to make a basic device on FAT32 or exFat? (I know how to make partitions though but  Seagate doesn't allow me to make one with a specific format) So then I can make partition and use this device on my Samsung LED too. Or should I return and buy WD Passport? I don't know what to do. I hope anyone will have good suggestions here.\n\nA: By accident I found that, by attempting to reformat my Seagate drive as FAT32 (which failed), I was then able to reformat to Mac OS (J Ex) with the partition options available… This then said it was able to work as a startup disk – not tried booting from the CCC backup yet, fingers crossed!\n\nA: Partitions are just a result of a logical splitting of a continuous disk. The partition table may have several mutually exclusive formats (e.g. Apple Partition Map or GUID). \nA partition may contain a file system (e.g. ExFAT or HFS+ Journaled) or not.\nSome of your devices won't be able to read a GUID (e.g your TV set) or some of the formatted volumes (e.g HFS+ Journaled can't be read by Windows system without additional drivers).\n\nSave the content (if any!) of the Seagate volumes to another drive.\nAttach the Seagate to your Mac and open Disk Utility:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose the Seagate in the left pane\n\n*Hit Partition\n\n*Select 2 Partitions\n\n\n\n*Hit the button Options…\n\n*Choose Master Boot Record\n\n\n\n*Choose appropriate sizes for the partitions by moving the slider\n\n*Choose a name and format for each of the partitions\nI recommend the following division.\n\n\n*\n\n*1st partition  Name: Photos Format: ExFAT\n\n*2nd partition Name: Mac     Format: Mac OS X Extended (Journaled)\n\n\n\nFinally apply the settings by hitting the button Apply.\nNow test the external disk with all your devices.\nYou may have to add a third partition to get the external disk working attached to your TV set. Choose the following set up:\n\n\n*\n\n*1st partition  Name: TV         Format: FAT\n\n*2nd partition Name: Photos  Format: ExFAT\n\n*3rd partition  Name: Mac      Format: Mac OS X Extended (Journaled)\n\n\nA: If you want your hard drive to work on your Mac and PC AND tv then you should format your hard drive to MS—DOS (Fat32). Just remember that you probably won’t be able to have movie files bigger than 4gb. \n\nA: I fixed it after so many tries.\nI formated drive as Mac OS X extended. Otherwise it didn't allow me to make partitions on other formates.

Now it sends me to the Create Account (Apple video intro, select a language, and everything) and when I'm done creating the account it sends me again to the start.

In older versions of Mac OS X, clicking the green button in a window title bar cause the window to grow in size, usually to grow to the full height and/or width of the screen. \nIn later versions, the behavior changed. Now clicking the green button causes the window to enter full-screen mode with both the menu bar and Dock hidden. Holding down the Option key while clicking the green button provides the grow-window behavior while changing the icon displayed when hovering.\nI would like to revert to the old behavior where clicking the green button grows the window without going into full-screen mode.\nIs there a way to permanently modify the behaviour of the green window button in OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)?

The behaviour requires modifications to the underlying window management framework.\nIndividual application developers may be able to achieve this behaviour but this would go counter to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. Going against these guidelines might risk the application being rejected from the Mac App Store.\nTell Apple\nSend Apple your feedback and let them know what you want and, most importantly, why you want this behaviour.\n\nA: rightzoom.app does exactly and just this.

Apple eventually deprecates products from its iOS update cycle.\nI wonder if there is a pattern to this. Has anyone worked this out and made a prediction about Apple deprecating support for old products. \nMy question is: When will the iPad 4th Gen stop getting iOS updates?\n\nA: Warning: conjecture ahead!\nIt's impossible to predict with certainty - but it helps to think about what is politically expedient for Apple, what is technically feasible (due to device specs), and by looking at past trends.\nImportantly: Apple has no stated-policy, but iOS updates seem to always be available for at least 2 years after a product was discontinued (excepting the original iPad)\nProduct    Launched    Discontinued     Last iOS Update Date   RAM\niPad 1     2010-04     2011-03 (1yr)    2012-05 (iOS 5.1.1)     256\niPad 2     2011-03     2014-03 (3yrs)   Current                 512\niPad 3     2012-03     2012-10 (7mo)    Current                1024\niPad 4     2012-11     2014-10 (2yrs)   Current                1024\niPad A1    2013-11     Current          Current                1024\niPad A2    2014-10     Current          Current                2048\n\niPad 2 was sold from 2011 until March 2014 - a long time - cynically, because it represented an 'entry-level' value-proposition from Apple with what I believe was a good profit margin compared to the relatively far more expensive retina iPads - so it wasn't much of a surprise to see the iPad 2 out-last the iPad 3 in 2012 and almost the iPad 4 (which was sold until October 2014).\nI think iOS 9 will be the last iOS update for the iPad 2 - look at that 512MB RAM figure, that was probably the reason the iPad 1 with its tiny 256MB RAM wasn't given the iOS 6 update. 1024MB RAM gives more breathing room - while the iPad 3 is older than the iPad 4, they are very similar internally (the major change in the iPad 4 was the Lightning connector) - so I expect them both to stop receiving iOS updates on the same date.\nI think the iPad Air 2 is the new iPad 2 and will serve as Apple's new 'entry level' tablet so it will have a longer market lifespan and will probably be discontinued after it's at least 3 years old and receive updates for at least 2 years after then (though I'm surprised the iPad Air 1 is still in production given the iPad Pro 10\" is now available).\nMy predictions:\nModel     Discontinued   Last iOS Update\niPad 2    2014-03        iOS 9 (2016)\niPad 3    2012-10        iOS 10 (2017)\niPad 4    2014-10        iOS 10 (2017)\niPad A1   2016-10        iOS 11 (2018)\niPad A2   2017-10        iOS 12 (2019)\n\n", "Q: Can I control my iPhone from my Mac? I want to play mobile games on my Mac. How do I do that? I have been seeing a lot of iPhones controlling Macs. Where is the Mac controlling the iPhone?\n\nA: You cannot do it. iPhone are deisnged in a way so that you can't control them externally. Emulation is impossible, iPhone is locked from being reverse engineered. You can still emulate Android apps (many of iOS games are available on Android too) and you would not even need an Android phone.

Any help would be highly appreciated! \n\nA: I've been struggling with VPN since 10.11.4. I'm unable to connect to a VPN server that I've used for a long time. I hope this is not noise, but here's what I have encountered in my research...\nMy problem is with an L2TP tunnel. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7502488 discusses a potentially related problem with respect to Cisco IPSec VPN. The interesting part there is that some have reported success changing to Diffie-Hellman group 14.\nSlightly related is the App Store description of the 10.11.4 OS X server where they say \"L2TP/IPsec VPN profiles now require 2048-bit or stronger Diffie-Hellman groups\". This is consistent with the group 14 reports above since group 14 has 2048 bits.\nAt https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/12276506/diffie-hellman-groups they discuss the relative strengths of the various groups. One post says that group 14 is the minimum acceptable security for key exchange.\nSo I've started to think that Apple is now ruling out groups 1, 2, and 5. This is bad for me since those are the only groups supported by the older tunnel server I used to connect to.\nI also use Private Internet Access sometimes. I tested connecting to them using L2TP. It worked fine. However, even with verbose logging, I couldn't find any log entries related to a negotiated DH group. But PIA is a security focused service. So, I'm guessing they would avoid a DH group considered insecure by some.\nI contacted Apple Care. They were unable to help. I didn't push them to escalate it.\nI tested from my Mac using wireless, Ethernet, and tethered to my 3G phone. My work partner, running an older mac that hasn't been updated to 10.11.4, connects fine to the server.\nI also tested with my iPhone. It cannot connect either. Unfortunately, I've updated that recently to iOS 9.3. forums_developer_apple_com/thread/31608 reports problems with iOS 9.3 in addition to OS X 10.11.4.

I saved the video from iMovie but it is in .mov format! How do I convert it to .mp4?\nI'm using a MacBook and I want to share it to my phone, but my phone can't open .mov format video.\n\nA: Apple's gotcha had ya covered. ...Sadly, things have changed with the advent of macOS 10.13 High Sierra :\\\nOnce upon a time You can you could use QuickTime Player to export .mov files and have them converted to .m4v files that will play on your other Apple products. M4V is a video container format developed by Apple from the MP4 standard - M4V is very similar to the MP4 format. The main difference is that M4V supports DRM copy protection - such as for copyrighted material viewed with Apple TV.\n\nThere's also a \"Share\" option in the player when you open a .mov file in QuickTime Player:\n\n...and I am not sure if this converts the file, but you can use it to send your video to your mobile device with, for example, the Messages app.  \nSee this article for more information on the difference between MP4 and M4V.  \nLastly, per this tutorial, you can just Export the file from iMovie:  \n\n\n\nA: You can also use VLC to convert .mov into several formats:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install and open VLC\n\n*Go to \"File\" > \"Convert / Stream...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*Load the video (for example drag the .mov file into box)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Choose the format you want\n\n*Click on \"Save as File\" button, sit back and relax\n\n\nA: I personally find using ffmpeg shell program (available through Brew using brew install ffmpeg) the most convenient way to do the conversions.\nIt includes tons of options for nearly any single thing you could possibly do with a movie.\nIn your case though, for a conversion, you can simply type:\nffmpeg -i /path/to/input/file /path/to/output.mp4\nThe .mp4 extension in the output path serves as a cue for the program to do the proper conversion -- no more options are necessary.\n\nA: Handbrake\nYou can use Handbrake to convert .mov to .mp4 files.\n\nHandBrake is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs.\nReasons you’ll love HandBrake:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Convert video from nearly any format\n  \n*Free and Open Source\n  \n*Multi-Platform (Windows, Mac and Linux)\n  \n\n\n\nA: So I tried converting .mov to .mp4 with both methods.. ffmpeg and handbrake\ninput .mov file size: 8.6 MB\nffpmeg\ncmd:\nbrew install ffmpeg\nffmpeg -i input.mov output.mp4\n\nOutput .mp4 size: 1.2 MB\nHandbrake\ndownload from https://handbrake.fr/\nconverted using GUI with default settings.\nOutput .mp4 size: 622 KB\n\nLooks like handbrake exports with smaller size with no noticeable video quality difference. Also, ffmpeg installs tons of dependencies and installation took several minutes.\ntldr: I'd go with handbrake.\n\nA: Which iPhone models who you own? The iPhone can only play H.264 or MPEG-4 video. The most simple way is downloading Handbrake, which not only assists you to convert MOV to iPhone suppported H.264 or MPEG-4 video, but also offers advanced profile parameters adjusting function to assist you to get better output video and audio quality.\n", "Q: Backup picture using FreeFileSync I would like to backup my pictures using FreeFileSync, I say pictures because i want to migrate both iPhoto and photos libraries till i figure which one i want to keep\nI have my reasons not to use TimeMachine\nSo with FreeFileSync which folder should i be selecting as the folder to sync?\n\nA: To back up photos visible in Photos.app and iPhotos.app, select the folder: \n~/Pictures/\n\nWhere ~ is your home folder.\n", "Q: How do you create an OS X ISO if you already have access to an iMac? I am using Ubuntu 14.04, and I want to create a virtual machine running OS X. I have a friend who owns an iMac with OS X Yosemite. Is there any way to create an ISO without downloading an installer? Or is there any way to download a legit ISO from my computer?\n\nA: The only option you have is to have your friend download the installer and create a ISO image. The other options are p2p.\nHowever, when you click 'I Agree' on the EULA, you are stating that you have a legal license, i.e the VM running OS X is hosted on a Mac.\n\nA: You can't create an installer iso from an installed OS X system (without OS X Yosemite installer downloaded).\n\nAside from the legality of your intention you can clone the disk of the iMac though and move the final vdi file to your host system, if you don't want to create an installer image:\nBoot to another boot volume with a full system on a different disk (e.g. a USB thumb drive). VirtualBox has to be installed. You need a third drive with enough free space to save the disk image.\nOpen Terminal and enter:\ndiskutil list\n\nto get the device node of the main disk (probably /dev/disk0).\nUnmount the disk with:\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0\n\nClone the main disk with:\nsudo VBoxManage convertfromraw /dev/disk0 /Volumes/Path/to/OSX.vdi --format VDI\n\nThis will create a dynamic disc containing all volumes (EFI/Recovery HD/main disk etc.) with roughly the size of the occupied blocks of the disk: unallocated disk space or free volume space won't be copied!\nChange the ownership of the file:\nsudo chown user:group /Volumes/Path/to/OSX.vdi\n\nCopy/move the file to your host.\nNow open VirtualBox and create a new VM -> OS X 10.10 and configure it. Choose the file OSX.vdi as main hard disk. To get the VM working you may have to choose a different chipset: PIIX3 instead of the default ICH9. You may also have to change the CPUID with:\n# get the name of the OS X VM\nVBoxManage list vms \n# change the CPUID of the OS X Yosemite VM (here the name is OSX)\nVBoxManage modifyvm OSX --cpuidset 00000001 000306a9 00020800 80000201 178bfbff\n\nNow boot the VM and create a new admin and remove all other users or unwanted apps.\n\nHowever, I still recommend to create a dmg image using the OS X Yosemite installer and install it from scratch.\n\nA: \nIs there any way to create an ISO without downloading an installer?\n\nThere is no way to create an ISO without downloading the installer.  The next logical question is Can you download a premade ISO?  The answer to that is yes but you won't be getting it from Apple.  I am not saying you can't get it from a torrent or some other site, what I am saying is that it is one of the most risky thing you can do - to download an unauthorized installation ISO of OS X.\n\nis there any way to download a legit ISO from my computer?\n\nNo for two reasons.  One, you can't download an ISO; you can download the installer and create an ISO.  Two, you can't download the installer on anything but OS X.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro stuck on loading screen trying to boot from new SSD So I recently bought a brand new SSD for my Macbook Pro Mid 2009 Unibody. I installed the new El Capitan operating system on the SSD by using a USB-SATA cable. After it finished installing, i replaced the old harddrive with the SSD and booted the mac. However when trying to boot it gets stuck on the apple logo with progress bar underneath. It just sits there at 100% (picture below) and has done so for about 5-6 hours now.\nAnybody with some sort of solution or question feel free to write I am almost willing to do anything to get it to work.\n\n\nA: Software causes\nPossibly OS X might be booting expecting to have to work with the USB bus and getting confused by the fact it's now over SATA?\nIt in theory should handle that fine, but back in the day that did happen sometimes when making a clean install on a drive over USB and then moving it to SATA.\nNever had the problem with Cloning an existing drive since then the OS was still set up like it was on the drive that you replaced, but clean installs sometimes would get set up in such at way that when it was no longer using USB to boot it would just hang.\nSo if that's it, running the install afresh should fix it up.\nJust checking as well, is the SSD formatted as a GUID partition table, with a Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) filesystem?\nHardware Causes\nIf the above doesn't fit it, but the SSD works fine over the USB to SATA connector, then it might be a problem with the Hard Drive flex cable in your Mac, or possibly (though pretty unlikely, really) the SATA controller on the Logic Board.\nWere you replacing the Hard Drive just because you felt like it was a upgrade, or were you having problems with it before. If you were previously having problems, the flex cable could very likely be your culprit.\nOther than that, if you accidentally disturbed the Memory modules in your Mac, it is possible it might be hanging just because of that and removing and reinstalling them could get you up and running again. Best to se if you can start the computer from your removed hard drive or the Install CDs that came with the Mac first since if either of those work ok, then it is not the Memory, and you don't really want to handle those modules if you don't have to.\nMore Troubleshooting\nHere is a bit more information you can update your post with that can help the folks here troubleshoot with you \n\n*\n\n*SSD model\n\n*How you formatted the SSD\n\n*Was the Hard Drive working fine before replacement\n\n*Was the computer powered down normally (Apple Menu > Shut Down)\nbefore the SSD was disconnected after you installed it\n\n*Can you start the computer by holding the Command and R keys\n\n\nA: Have you tried to reboot – often it helps in such situations?\n", "Q: About Mac computer's file permission I was trying to install Joomla on my Macbook Air under XAMPP. I successfully installed it, but when I try to open the front-end, I keep getting this mkdir():permission denied error.\nTwo questions raised while I was trying to solve this problem:\n\n*\n\n*I noticed when I do ls -l, the owner/group of some folders is myname:admin, while those of other folders is root:admin. I am the only user of this computer and the myname user should have all root privileges.\nWhat I don't understand:\nA. Why when I do chmod I had to sudo chmod.\nB. Why there are folders with different owner.\n\n\n*To solve the problem, I forcefully changed owner/group of all related files and directories to root:root and permissions of those to 0777. But eventually I will have to move this over to a production server and it is not wise to keep the owner and permission like this. Is there any better way to solve the problem while keeping the owner/permission settings as tight as possible?\n\nA: sudo is needed to change permissions of files and folders that the current user account does not have permissions to modify.\nIn this case, the chmod myname required sudo because some of the files and folders being modified were owned by root.\nBy default, the first user account is an administrator. This is likely the account you are currently using. Administrator permissions are not equivalent to those of root. root exists above administrator users on OS X.\nWith regard to how best to deploy Joomla on a production server, this is better asked in a separate question.\n\nA: The easiest way to change permissions and owner of a file, volume or folder is to use BatchMod. Once downloaded from here\nhttp://www.lagentesoft.com/batchmod/\nyou will have to run the program. It will prompt you to insert the Administrator password to gain Superuser access. Type it discretely and then you will be allowed to select a file. Make sure to tick \"Change owner and permission\", and then, feel free to change permissions as you wish. You will have to confirm and the process will be extremely quick. This saved my back when trying to gain permissions onto a TimeMachine Backup I had which refused to open.\n", "Q: How to lower iPhone/iPad brightness?

If i set an automator scrip to run each evening at 23:00 but my Macbook / Macbook Pro is closed (not off, but the lid has been closed) will / can the automator script still run ? \n\nA: No, the Automator workflow will not run when your MacBook's lid is closed.\nThis is because your Mac is asleep and not actively running user applications and processes. You can prevent your Mac from sleeping when the lid is closed.

Can we mention them specifically as “iPhone”, “iPad”, etc. or should we use generic terms, e.g. “compatible smartphone”, “compatible tablet”? This would be text in the app itself, e.g. a button labelled “Connect to Your iPad”.\nThe guidelines indicate separate rules for publications depending on the target, e.g. “iPhone®” within the US, but “iPhone” with a separate credit section outside of the US. But does an app count as a publication? We can't really guarantee someone outside the US will not download an app targeted to the US, or vice versa.\nI guess precedence would help here. Is anyone familiar with an iOS app which uses “iPhone”, “iPad”, etc. liberally in the app itself?\n\nA: You should be OK. Apple guideline 3.3 states \n\nGuideline 3.3: Apps with names, descriptions, screenshots, or previews not relevant to the content and functionality of the App will be rejected.\n\nIf your app requires a specific device to function be sure to mention that in the comments when you submit it for review. \nThe main thing you can't do is mention a different platform:\n\nGuideline 3.1: Apps or metadata that mentions the name of any other mobile platform will be rejected.\n\nYou can really help yourself by clearly indicating why you used the device name in the comments. I always add comments during app submissions and I believe it's helped prevent a few rejections for more info.\n", "Q: Moving from Google (Android) to iPhone I have been using Android for many years, now I have an iPhone.\nI am used to Gmail, having my Contacts as Gmail contacts, Google maps, backup of SMS to Google, Chrome with sync of online bookmarks, backup of photos to Google Photos, Google Calendar (in browser)\nBasically, in what cases should I look for \"native\" replacements, and in what cases is it natural to use Google stuff?\n(I have used the migration app)\n\nA: To start, congratulations on the upgrade :)\nNow, what I would do is connect the old phone to my computer (Mac or PC), open Finder (or My Computer), and double-click on the GUI representation of the phone to see the contents, now take the folder marked \"DCIM\" and copy to your computer.\nIf you have a Mac, open Photos (10.10.3 or later, for earlier see the Windows method below as it's about the same). Now, import the folder into your photo library and sync the library to your iPhone.\nOn Windows, you'll need to download iTunes from Apple (nowhere else) and then follow this Apple support article, scroll down to \"Sync your photos manually with iTunes.\"\n\nA: For contacts, I expect the iOS contacts app will suffice. \nFor Maps, while Apple Maps is fine, Google Maps has more data and is what I have decided to use, but you can try Apple Maps for a while and see if it suits you. It does have Siri integration which is a big plus for me. However, I ride my bike for daily transit, and that is one thing Apple Maps does not support. \nSafari is a good browser, but if you use Chrome on Windows or Linux I'd recommend sticking with Chrome. There is a plugin available, which is what I currently use, but that is up to you. \nGoogle photos is available for iOS, so I'd stick with that, as for calendar: The IOS calendar app can be synced with your Google account so I'd stick with that as well. \nAnd for gmail itself: I used the iOS mail app for a long time, which is basic but works well, but it really depends what features you want. I currently use Inbox for Gmail, which is a somewhat alternative client. \nHope this helped!\n", "Q: MySQL fails to start after update I am on Yosemite 10.10.5 and just now I updated my outdated MySQL to the latest version.

I can't find anything online about this.\nI tried to change the password through iCloud.com, but the iPad isn't and won't connect to the internet.  I am about to try to restore through iTunes, but by what I remember you cannot restore without unlocking your device.  But before I try to restore, is there a way to change your password with the device locked?

Hardware limitations are not a problem for me. I am mostly concerned about the long term effects that running Windows might have on my Mac.\nI am assuming that there will be no impact on the hardware. If I install and run Windows for the next 6 months, and then uninstall it, then the hardware would respond exactly as it would 6 months ago. Is this true?\nMy biggest concern is regarding what might be left behind due to this adventure. I will be either using Virtual Box, VMware or BootCamp.

A Mac is basically an Intel based PC. \nIf you are using a VM, regardless of the platform (VMware, VirtualBox, etc) once you delete the virtual machine, it's gone.

I have an XCode project that I tried to delete manually, and I did delete it, but some reference is left - apparently. This reference is making this project still display on the Welcome screen of XCode (XCode version 7.3) on El Capitan. If I try to double click on this non-existing project I get message in a popup \"The file 'project.xcworkspace' doesn’t exist.\" and after that, when I click OK in that popup, I get another popup with message \"The file 'Skocko.xcodeproj' doesn’t exist.\"\nHow can I completely remove this project and not have it on Welcome page, since it is very confusing issue?\n\nA: Open Xcode and go to File --> Open Recent.  From there select Clear Menu.  This will remove the shortcut to your most recent projects.  Close Xcode and reopen it.  Skocko project should be gone from the Welcome screen.\n\nA: One option that works is to delete the project folder. Obviously you might not want to do this, but a valid reason for not wanting the project listed on startup is that you do not want the project anymore.\n", "Q: Continue moving files when process stopped I was transferring (moving) files from one drive to another.

I ask this because some of them moved, and now they are not in the source folder... but the destination folder is \"untouchable\".\n\nA: If the source has the same number of solid files as the destination has translucent, it is safe to manually resume the move. Drag and drop to move from source to destination, and select \"replace\" when prompted. Translucent files are just empty placeholder files.\nMy personal practice always involves copying, then deleting once done. To insist on a copy, hold down Option.

Has anyone else seen this?\n\nA: You might try to hold home and lock buttons for a while until the device reboots the OS. This startup will require a little longer because it will be deeper than normal restart.\niOS 9.3 has brought many bugs, this should be one of them. I believe for now you should lock it with code time set to \"immediately\" (for safety reasons), make a YouTube video to explain the issue (I did a similar thing for a buggy update of PlayStation Vita, and it got fixed), report it to Apple and wait for 9.3.1 to come out.\n", "Q: How do I pass the following error message in the Boot Camp Assistant: \"Please format the USB drive as single FAT partition.\"?

For others however this did not work.\nAny advice on how to make the Boot Camp Assistant accept my USB drive would be much appreciated.\n\nA: To most easily resolve this, you need to erase your USB drive with a \"Master Boot Record\" scheme.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*Select the USB drive\n\n*Click \"Erase\"\n\n*Choose Format \"MS-DOS (FAT)\"\n\n*MOST IMPORTANT: Choose Scheme \"Master Boot Record\"\n\n*Click Erase button\n\n\nMany thanks to nholtappels for figuring out the problem!\n\nA: After some trial and error, I finally figured out what the problem was and found a solution. Hopefully this will help those who come across this thread with the same problem.\nThe problem: Reformatting using Disk Utility did not create a child partition, but only formatted the whole drive as FAT. In Disk Utility one can derive this from the \"Partition\" button being greyed out when the USB drive is selected. In Terminal, the diskutil list command shows the USB drive having only one DeviceNode (labelled 0).\nThe solution: Reformatting the USB drive using diskutil in Terminal. This is the command line equivalent of Disk Utility, but unlike its GUI Counterpart, it creates a child partition, which in turn solves the error thrown by Boot Camp Assistant.\nWARNING: Proceed with caution! If you have never used a command line interface before, you might want to ask a tech-savvy friend for help. I take no responsibility for the outcome of this. If you fry your hardware in the process, that's on you. Good luck!\nStepwise:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal application. You can find it by searching Spotlight for \"Terminal\" (sans quotes).\n\n*In Terminal, type diskutil list and hit enter.\n\n*Look at the results and determine the identifier of your target USB drive. It will look like this: /dev/diskX. If you have only one external drive connected, this should be easy to figure out (hint: behind the identifier it says (internal, ...) or (external, ...)).\n\n*Run the following command to reformat your USB drive: diskutil partitionDisk /dev/diskX 1 MBR fat32 NAME 8G. Replace /dev/diskX with the identifier of your drive which you obtained in the previous step. Replace NAME with the name you want to give the partition (which essentially doesn't matter). Make it all CAPS to avoid problems. Replace 8 in 8G with the number of Gigabytes you want your partition to have. It's easiest to just go with the total size of your USB drive.\n\n*Wait for it to complete.\n\n*Verify the output. The end of the command's output should show the formatting of your drive. You should see two DeviceNodes: 0, of type FDisk_partition_scheme, and 1, of type DOS_FAT_32 and with the identifier diskXs1 where X is a digit corresponding to the identifier you found in step 3.\n\n*Run Boot Camp Assistant again and be happy because it finally works like a charm.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro mid 2009 reports \"Service Battery\" but works ok I get a message saying \"Service Battery\", but it continues working ok. How do I service the battery?\n\nA: The message that you are getting is because your battery is beginning to fail.  I can't tell you exactly when, but more than likely, when you need it most, it will no longer hold a charge.\nIt's actually quite easy to service the battery.  There are 10 phillips screws on the bottom.  Just remove those (pay attention to where they came out), then you will have access to the battery, memory, and hard drive.\n\n\nI answered a very similar question on a 2009 MBP battery replacment.  \nHave a look What's the easiest/cheapest way to replace my battery? 2009 MBP for further details.\n\nA: I actually have a 2009 MacBook Pro and I took out almost every component of it to replace the keyboard and put it back together again (bought it broken for $20, spent $23 on a new keyboard, and now I have a $600 computer). Anyways, a battery is the first thing to come out, and thus the repair is actually very simple, so long as you have the right tools.\nYou need to remove the Phillips screws on the bottom, disconnect the battery from the logic board, then remove the Torx screws (I think) holding the battery, and remove the battery.\nSee this iFixit guide for more info.\n", "Q: wiping old phone I just got a new iphone today.   I set it up and restored the old information onto my new phone.   I went back into my old phone to erase everything on it and it keeps telling me the icloud password is invalid.  I know it isn't because I used the same password to get into my new phone.  How do I erase the old phone?\n\nA: Apple made it so there is no way to erase and reuse iPhone without knowing the iCloud password.\nYou can perform the actual Restore by putting it in DFU mode and using Finder/iTunes, but you'll need the original iCloud credentials to reactivate it.\n\nA: Apple has all the steps needed here - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201351\nUnless you need to get health data off an Apple Watch, it doesn’t matter much in the end if you don’t unravel all the data before you wipe and give away the old device. I prefer to do the steps while I have possession of the old phone so I know they’re done when I can, though.\n", "Q: iPhone Spotlight not showing results A few OS updates ago (maybe as far back at the first 9.x version?), Spotlight search on my iPhone has performed very inconsistently.  I can enter the same search string several times, but I'd say no more than 50% of the time do any results appear.\nI've tried reseting & restoring my iPhone, but the problem persists.\nIs this a known regression or something I can try to fix?\n\nA: I too have had this problem since I updated. Usually I find it's just some serious lag ad if you wait it out results will show up. If not there may be a bigger problem with your iPhone. Or you might just need to do a good old software update!\n", "Q: How does Find My Mac work exactly? My Macbook Pro 13 (2015) was recently stolen. I activated FMM about an hour after the event and two hours later received an update that the machine was erased. Questions:\n1) What does this mean exactly? Is this message triggered when the wipe is initiated or after the wipe is completed. Can I reliably infer that the HDD was wiped? What's to prevent the baddie from simply turning off the machine when the wipe is initiated? I'm just trying to understand the possible outcomes here, especially with the data on the drive.\n2) The HDD was encrypted with filevault 2. Does this provide effective protection from anyone getting at the data?\n3) Is the machine bricked (like an iOS device would be) or can it still be resold as a working computer?\n\nA: I am assuming that you clicked on the option to \"Erase your Mac\" when you activated FMM.  If you got a message that the machine was erased, then the drive was erased.\nAs for the HDD, filevault does offer good protection against the most common of thieves, but nothing is perfect.  Chances are they can't crack the encryption.  However, if you wiped the drive, this is moot.\nIs the machine \"bricked?\"  I don't know.  Did you lock it with a PIN code?  If you didn't, it can still work.  However, if you locked it down with a PIN, you have effectively bricked it.\nNow...did you file a police report?\n", "Q: In Yosemite, suddenly the application Photos is not open anymore Photo.app does not open when clicked on in the dock or in the list of apps.\nMessage comes up \"The application \"Photos.app\" is not open anymore\". How can I re-open it?\n\nA: I'd try clearing the saved state files.\nFrom Finder:  \n\n\n*\n\n* Cmd ⌘   N   \n\n* Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   G      \n\n*Copy/paste ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Photos/Data/Library/Saved Application State\nFind the folder com.apple.Photos.savedState and delete it.\nThat should give Photos a fresh start.\n"]
