["Q: Upgrade iPhone 4G from iOS 4.1 to any iOS Is there any possibility for me to upgrade to any iOS on my iPhone 4G from iOS 4.1?\nMine is still a nice stable phone, but I can't download any apps. It is jailbroken, unlocked and I have saved the SHSH blobs if that would help.\nI have tried updating for a long time, but it did not work because the Apple signing has ceased by the time I try.\n\nA: You will have to plug your iPhone into a computer and update using iTunes to the latest iOS version. This will of course undo the jailbreak. \n\nA: You can upgrade iPhone 4G to latest iOS 7.1.2, but since your iPhone is jailbreak, the phone itself cannot complete the upgrade. You need connect the phone with itunes on computer, and use iTunes to complete the upgrade process.\n", "Q: Completely uninstall, remove, delete any reference to Coda 2 by Panic! How do I completely remove Coda 2 by Panic!? I love the app, and have been using it for years, however I did a fresh install on a new mac, and had it all set up, then I went to add some plugins and it screwed it up somehow. None of my preferences are stored, none of my ssl's are stored. I can't reconfigure the app, cause when I go into the preferences every time it crashes as soon as I close the pane out.\nAll in all I know the app works well, but it seems theres a glicth in it somewhere that can only possibly be resolved by completely removing it.\nI have dragged it from the application folder to the trash..\nI removed the Coda 2 folder from Users/username/Library/Application\\ Support/Coda\\ 2/\nand I reinstalled it, problem here is same issues occur again, I didn't install any plugins so its just the app. Now I know there is also something storing more data somewhere. Since the install didn't show the app in its default state which is large buttons at the top, and I noticed going into the preference pane that there was some non default options checked as well. So the two things I did to remove it didn't completely remove it.\nAnd since Apple appears to think that no one will ever uninstall anything and thusly doesn't have a method tried and true to uninstall anything I am at a loss. Any ideas how I can remove everything to this app, and get it essentially reset to as if it was never installed before so when I install it again thats the state I get?\n\nA: My guess is you probably just need to nuke your user preferences.\nOpen terminal and past this command (make a backup of the Mac if you don't trust this):\ndefaults delete com.panic.coda2\n\nYou can also make a brand new user on the Mac and try opening coda there to double check it's not some other file somewhere or it it's really something out of your user home folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Isolating an issue by using another user account\n", "Q: Are the iPhone 4 charger and iPod 4 charger different? Are the iPhone 4 charger and iPod 4 charger different? I can charge my iPhone with both, but my iPhone charger will not charge my iPod. (I'm thinking it might be the length of the 30-pin connector, because the iPod touch is curved)\nI know the outlet and wall adapter work.\n\nA: No, they aren't.\nHere you can find the two type of charger, 5W (iPod and iPhone charger) and 12W (iPad, iPod, iPhone charger) with compatibility list.\nThe length of 30 pin connector is always the same (it is standardised for Apple).\n\nA: Yes it is the same and you can charge them with both which is very handy.\n", "Q: Spotlight doesn't work after Yosemite Upgrade Why doesn't Spotlight work now that I've upgraded to Yosemite?

I have some animated gifs in the Photos library on my Mac. When I sync them to my iPhone (using iTunes) they either don't transfer at all, or they show up as jpegs of the first frame of the gif.\nI've tried sending them to myself using Messages.app. This works, but they get shrunk to a postage stamp size that looks small even on the phone screen. I want a way to send them full size, and to keep them synced with my Photos library.\n\nA: Apple Photos appears to support GIF but not animated GIF.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204264\nI suggest you try a different cloud solution for your animated GIFs like Dropbox or Google Drive.\n\nA: After several trials, I found that the app \"Send Anywhere\" (for both Mac and iPhone) does what you want. \nYou will be able to send photos or animated pics directly without hassle. I tried it myself, the animated pics are all frozen when I tried to preview in iPhone photos. However, when I tried to send the pics over with a chat app, the animation works well! So to answer your question, don't complicate, just download that app!\n\nA: This must be another bug form Apple. If I download a animated GIF from Safari to Photos on iPhone I can see the animation in Photos for iOS. If I import the GIF in Photos.App on my Mac it is also displayed correctly as an animation on Mac. Importing the GIF, it is deleted from the iPhone Photo.App.\nIf I then sync back my iPhone using iTunes with my Mac, the GIF is synced back but on the Photo.App on the iPhone it now appears as a static picture....\nJust another Apple bug. \nThe only workaround for me is to export a copy of the GIF on my Dropbox. This works perfectly without these stupid Apple-Bugs.\n", "Q: what happens if I update unlocked iphone software? what happens if I update unlocked iphone software? \nI have iphone 4s with iOS 6.0.1 and I want to update to iOS 8.3 \nMy iphone was unlocked by Goguo i-4s v6.1 card \nWhat happens if I do this update or reset my device? Does it re-locked again? \n\nA: Since this card only works for iOS 5-6 it is likely that it will not work once you upgrade to iOS 8. According to the website you provided there is a NEW GOGUO V15 Unlock Card which works for iOS 8. \n", "Q: hostname returns another device's name I realized that the hostname had changed while I was doing some work using terminal in OS X Yosemite.

I looked up my public IP address using Google, like this:\n\n\nA: By default, your Mac will take the host name from the router when it received a DHCP reservation reply.\nYou can change this by not using DHCP or fixing the router or as a last resort over-writing the host name once you notice it's gone amok:\nsudo scutil --set ComputerName whatever\nsudo scutil --set LocalHostName whatever\n\n", "Q: iTunes asking for password for wrong iTunes account I purchased a new phone at Sam's club and they transferred the data from my old iPhone to my new iPhone. But now more and more apps will not update with out the password for an iTunes account that I don't know who's is. Even apps that I have downloaded since that data transfer have this problem. I have tried rebooting my iPhone, logging in and out of iTunes, and deleting and reinstalling the app but nothing works. \n\nA: Try signing out of iTunes on your iPhone and signing in as your Apple ID. After you login as the right account, delete all the apps you have downloaded and redownload them. \n", "Q: Can OS X be installed on the ssd part of the fusion drive? I am looking at purchasing a mac mini and need to decide on a storage option.\nI want either an ssd or the fusion drive however I am not sure whether OS X can be installed on the SSD part of the fusion drive which is one of the main reasons that i want an SSD.\n\nA: Yes, there's a way to install OS X on the SSD. It's called \"install OS X on the Fusion Drive.\"\nThe Fusion Drive automatically puts the most frequently-used files on the SSD. When there are vital system files that your hard drive needs to access in its every waking moment, there's really no reason why the Fusion Drive would ever demote it to the HDD.\n\nA: Short answer is no.\nFusion drive has its own algorithm to determine which individual file goes to which drive, based on frequency of access. It doesn't offer any interface to configure the location of files. Moreover, it doesn't even list out which file belongs to which drive. In fact, the only way to know where a file is, is to read the file while the user monitor data flow from both drives.\nI don't see why you need to force the entire copy of OSX onto SSD. Frequently used portions of the system, such as start up routine, are most definitely on SSD. There is no reason to have the icons file of some hidden app that an user never use also forced onto SSD.\nIf you want the entirety of system files on SSD against all, you will need to run the two drives desperately, in the lame way. Then you can put /Appications and /Users in appropriate drives.\nIf you want to put certain files always on HDD. you can create a partition on HDD, outside of Fusion Drive. Files on this partition will never end up in SDD. Vice versa does not apply.\n\nA: I just loaded my OS X onto the SSD part of my Fusion Drive without any problems. During setup it asked me which drive I wanted it installed on and I picked the SSD part.\n", "Q: mtrecorder and spirecorder, what are they? I've run a EtreCheck on my OS X 10.10.3 just now and I got some error messages.\nProblem System Launch Daemons:\n    [failed]    com.apple.mtrecorder.plist\n\nLaunch Daemons:\n    [failed]    com.apple.spirecorder.plist\n\nI did some research from Google but seems I cannot find some useful information. I am a little bit worry about the system since these two components come from Apple.\n\nThe content of com.apple.spirecorder.plist is:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>EnableTransactions</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>PathState</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>/var/db/.spirecorder.forcedenable</key>\n            <true/>\n            <key>/var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spirecorder.enable</key>\n            <true/>\n        </dict>\n        <key>SuccessfulExit</key>\n        <false/>\n    </dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.apple.spirecorder</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/local/libexec/spirecorder</string>\n        <string>-count</string>\n        <string>50000</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Umask</key>\n    <integer>18</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe content of com.apple.mtrecorder.plist is:\nYang$ plutil -convert xml1 -o - /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mtrecorder.plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>EnableTransactions</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>PathState</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>/var/db/.mtrecorder.forcedenable</key>\n            <true/>\n            <key>/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mtrecorder.enable</key>\n            <true/>\n        </dict>\n        <key>SuccessfulExit</key>\n        <false/>\n    </dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.apple.mtrecorder</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/local/libexec/mtrecorder</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>Umask</key>\n    <integer>18</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nAnd both /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/ and /usr/local/libexec folders are not exists on my Mac.\nBy the way I found com.apple.spirecorder.plist in another LaunchDaemons folder which includes only one file, I removed it, rebooted and no problem with it. Now EtreCheck shows only one error with mtrecorder, I am not sure whether I am going to remove it since it comes with lots of Apple daemons in the same folder.\n\nA: Both of these plist files appear to be part of the iOS operating system, that have been left in OS X by accident due to the shared nature of their development.\nThe reason you are seeing errors in EtreCheck for these files is that the plist files are telling the launchd process to run executables that don't actually exist on Macs, but only on iOS devices. And even then perhaps only on devices that are used for development.\nI think you are safe to remove both files (although I would keep a copy of them somewhere), firstly because they are failing to launch anyway, and secondly because only seem to relate to components of the iOS operating system.\n", "Q: Iphone third generation I have and iphone three and I forgot the password on it and it didn't work when i went to restore it. I really need to get back on it again.\n\nA: It can happen one forgets the password.\nApple knows that and has made every effort to help you with recovering it.\nThe quickest way is to go to Apple website and request password reset.\nIt is a Automated process, and you will receive a email from Apple, so look for it.\nThere is more help here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201487\n", "Q: iPhone YouTube music player (background and no video) On Android there is an app called PVStar+ which is a YouTube player that lets the user play music in the background and turn off video.

You can put Tubex in the background or even turn off the screen and YouTube music keeps playing.  You can also login to your YouTube account and access favorites, playlists, etc...\nI've had it on my phone for months now in a variety of situations and with different people controlling the music and it's very stable and reliable.\n", "Q: Disable OS X Server's shutdown prompt? I've just installed OS X Server. Whenever I try to shut it down (as a local interactive user), I keep seeing a prompt that requires me to enter an admin's name and password before proceeding with the shutdown:\nShutting down may cause other users logged into this computer to lose unsaved changes.\n\n\nI keep seeing this dialog even though there is nobody else connected to the machine.\nQuestion is, how can I disable this dialog? I mean, let anybody who is logged in locally to shutdown the machine without entering an administrator password (or even without entering their own password?) I see this is not a security issue since with physical access, they can just press the power button.\nMy original intention is to use the living room's iMac as an Xcode build server, primarily to run unit tests. The machine starts and automatically logs in to a non-privileged account to make it convenient for people to use it to play videos and such. It would be nice to have this machine run unit tests as well, and it's really not critical if a build/run gets canceled mid-way because the machine is shutting down.\nServer version: 4.1 (14S1092)\nOS X: 10.10.3 (14D136)\n\nA: One possible way could be by using a terminal command:\nshutdown -h now\n\nThis immediately kills all processes and shuts your system down in a fairly nice manner.\nAs a normal user you could initiate this by \nsudo shutdown -h now\n\nBut the problem with password prompt remains, this time in the terminal.\nHaving a closer look to the sudo configuration file /etc/sudoers I found:\n...\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Uncomment to allow people in group wheel to run all commands\n# %wheel        ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Same thing without a password\n# %wheel        ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n...\n\nCheck whether your account is already in the wheel or admin group by issueing groups in the terminal. If that is the case, just uncomment the line with %wheel NOPASSWD or by adding NOPASSWD at the proper position of the admin line above (the wheel line shows you how to do this). For instance:\ntatooine-3:~ mallert$ groups\nstaff com.apple.sharepoint.group.2 everyone localaccounts _appserverusr\nadmin _appserveradm _lpadmin _appstore _lpoperator _developer\ncom.apple.access_screensharing com.apple.access_ssh com.apple.sharepoint.group.1\n\nHere my user is already in the admin group, therefore I would just add NOPASSWD in the sudoers line like this:\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD ALL\n\nNow you should be able to fire up a \nsudo shutdown -h now\n\nwithout being asked for a password. To finalize my solution you could create an app with automator which executes this sudo shutdown -k now command as a bash script.\nIf you want to reboot the server instead, use\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\n\nA: Its just simple just delete the server application from applications and install it again and do not create any other local server in it and it will be solved\n\nA: One thing to try if there is only one user logged in is, logging that user out which would then return to the login screen.  From the login screen there is a \"Shutdown\" button.  Choosing \"Shutdown\" from there would, hopefully, complete since there are (theoretically) no more users logged in.\nIf that doesn't work then you are going to have to create a script that uses the 'shutdown' or 'halt' commands to force the system to shutdown.  You may need to look at the man pages for those commands but 'shutdown -h' or 'halt' should work.  However, those commands need to be run with admin privileges in order to function properly.  So if you want anyone to be able to run the script (not just admins) then you will need to put it somewhere that is accessible to all user accounts and give the file admin privileges.\nIf you have to go the script route then I would try to get the 'shutdown' command to work first, since it is the safer way to shut down your system.  The 'halt' command is a bit brutal in the way that it kills off apps and shuts the system down.\n\nA: Holding down the option key while selecting Shut Down (or Restart) from the Apple menu will bypass the Dialog Box and cause the action to occur immediately.\n\nA: I experienced exactly the same problem and successfully solved it recently.\nYes, this is caused by server.app. To be exact, it is due to you linked you Xcode in your server.app \n\nIn this way, your server is running Xcode in the background, and hence the prompt when you attempt to shut you computer. Using command line interface to shut would not change the situation.\nInterestingly, once you \"Choose Xcode to begin\" here, there is no option to disconnect Xcode here. Switching off in the upper right corner would not help, even uninstalling server.app thoroughly would not help either.\nFortunately, the solution is as easy as two commands:  \nsudo xcrun xcscontrol --shutdown\nsudo xcrun xcscontrol --reset\n\nHere is how I found this: I looked through the Activity Monitor for processes with suspicious usernames, and noticed a user named \"_xcscouch\". By search \"xcscouch mac\", I found the following answer and it solved my problem.\nI Installed Server.app on Yosemite to enable caching, but see many server processes in Task Manager (_xcsbuild and _devicemgr and _calendar processes)\n\nA: There must be more than one users logged on your computer, you'd better log out users after a certain time limit.\n", "Q: I cannot sign in to App Store with my Apple ID I created a new Apple ID and verified it.

I click sign in button and the sign in button appears again. \nI tried to reinstall OS X but during the reinstall I am asked for my Apple ID and clicking the sign in button has no action and I am asked to sign in again.\nWhat is the problem?\n\nA: If you've created a new Apple ID, you need to have a valid OS X purchase  under this new Apple ID? Otherwise you might have to use—at least for the install—the Apple ID you used to buy OS X.\n", "Q: What is the difference between Trailer and Movie when creating a new one in iMovie?

The faster lights indicate it is trying to pair. Once the cable is disconnected, the Mac should request the pairing passcode which is 0000.\nThis pairing process should only be a one-time setup, and going forward you should be able to connect simply by turning the controller on.\nNote that you may need to reset the DS3 before attempting to connect it to your Mac - to do so, use a paperclip to click the reset button, which is left of the L2 button.\n\n(Image from Sony)\n\nA: Apparently, Yosemite breaks the support for the PS3 controller. This can be easily seen when looking into /var/log/system.log.

In other words on 10.9 both dev and *.dev would be passed to dnsmasq and resolved correctly, but on Yosemite this only happens for *.dev. dev is resolved by something else to an address other than the one configured in dnsmasq.\nI know dnsmasq works properly:\n# host dev localhost\nUsing domain server:\nName: localhost\nAddress: 127.0.0.1#53\nAliases: \n\ndev has address 127.0.0.1\n\nhowever:\n# ping -c 1 dev\nPING dev (127.0.53.53): 56 data bytes\n^C\n--- dev ping statistics ---\n1 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss\n# ping -c 1 a.dev\nPING a.dev (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.035 ms\n\n--- a.dev ping statistics ---\n1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.035/0.035/0.035/0.000 ms\n\nMy /etc/resolver/dev is:\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\n\nI know I can just add dev itself to /etc/hosts, since it's the only one that doesn't work it not a big deal. However I'd like to know if I did something wrong and if I can achieve the same behaviour I had previously on 10.9.\n\nA: 127.0.53.53 is a special address, indicating a possible name collision. What's happened is Google has registered .dev as a new TLD, and dnsmasq is trying to inform you that your use of .dev could collide with the new official use of .dev.\nThough it's strange you can get *.dev to resolve correctly, I can't, I just made Apache listen on 127.0.53.53 because I'm lazy like that.\nHere's ICANN's explanation of 127.0.53.53\n", "Q: Found iPhone 5s what next My friend gave me a iPhone 5s without a sim card.

At some point, Yosemite suddenly stopped working properly, Keychain errors popped up, my Desktop was empty, user folders cleared, etc. It looked like I accidentally deleted my own User folder. I checked the Terminal from where I attempted to delete old TM Backups and it really looked like I did nothing wrong. I thought, well, I must have overlooked something but for that reason I have Backups in the first place, so I booted into recovery and selected restore from Backup to facilitate my new Time Capsule. Since all Backups are password protected I tried to enter my password but got the error message that the system could not connect. I rebooted into what was left of my user and checked that the Time Machine password was in fact correct.\nAnyway, now I got access to the TC via tmutil and was wondering how I can restore the whole machine via Terminal.\n\nA: You likely do not want to attempt this from Terminal but if you did you would want to use tmutil restore ... Read the manual page - for what that involves. The issue will be you will have to specify via the command line where in the time capsule snapshot the restoration will be sourced from.\nFor more likely success you probably should re-boot using the Recovery HD or some other graphical user interface mechanism intended for this kind of restore from disaster scenario that will guide you in finding the right snapshot as described in the Time Machine FAQ \n\nA: Alright, the reason for me not being able to access my encrypted backup was a special character! The first password the TC asked for was the device password for the TC. I needed to enter the password (which is a different password from the TM password) as if on a U.S. layout. The actual TM backup password I entered as if on my original layout. I may file a radar regarding this behavior.\n", "Q: Send webpage from Mac to iOS using Handoff I use Chrome on my desktop and Safari on my iPhone and iPad.\nI have Handoff already set up on my devices so that when I am browsing on iOS, I get the dock icon on my Mac and can open the page in Chrome. However, I haven't been able to figure out to do it the other way around. I have a page open on my Mac in Chrome (or even Safari) and I want to open it on my iPhone or iPad. How is this done with Handoff?\n\nA: See this bug on chromium. Essentially it boils down to security settings that are not available unless the Mac app (Chrome, in this case) is released through the Mac App Store.\nNote that due to the way Handoff is implemented in Chrome/Mac, the current tab from Chrome/Mac can be opened in Safari/iOS. When you are in Handoff range and have an open tab in Chrome/Mac, you should see the Safari icon in the lower-left corner on the iOS lock screen. Swipe up on it, enter your PIN or passcode if applicable, and it should open the page in Safari. Alternatively, if the phone is already unlocked, double-tap the Home button to open the Application Switcher, and swipe all the way to the left.\nI added a suggestion to the above-referenced bug that they implement an \"Open in Chrome\" app extension for Chrome/iOS that would allow quickly opening the current Safari/iOS page in Chrome/iOS.\n", "Q: Deleted AppleColorEmoji@2x.ttf from my iOS device I read about a way to add iOS 8.3's new emojis to jailbroken iOS 8.1.2 devices and I made it but I deleted the iOS 8.1.2 file by mistake.\nNow I want to get back to the old emojis. I deleted the tweak but now I don't have the iOS 8.1.2 AppleColorEmoji@2x.ttf file. I can't open the emoji keyboard as it crashes because the file doesn't exist.\nHow can I get the old file?\n\nA: This file is copyrighted (or licensed) by Apple, so it will be difficult to find a download site for it.

After I had to change my email associated with my Apple ID, both my iPad & iPhone have gone berserk. Both are iOS 8. I have already repeatedly:  \nRebooted, signed out, clean the cache, reset all settings, reset the network (which gave me the added problem of now seeing \"No Service\" displayed in the upper left corner despite having service) erased all messages, rebooting each time I did anything.  I'm now reaching you on a totally ERASED & set up as new iPad... That still doesn't text!\nEspecially on the iPad, now, even after totally erasing and resetting, I go to Messages\nType in a name of a friend who DOES have an iPhone \nThe name is coming up in RED?\nIf I type in the message area, (back when the names were NOT RED) the SEND button was GRAYED OUT   you could not send \nOR \nAnd this was the first problem... I would compose a text, with or without a photo no difference. ... Phone or iPad, and get a red ❗️ With the notation 'message not sent'\nIt does not matter if the person has an iPhone or not.  The iPhone might send a plain text but no longer will send photos.  \nI tried to match settings from iPhone to iPad, but that didn't help. (The iPad doesn't use cellular, btw). The iPhone apparently will still allow SMS messages, but the iPad will not.  If I turn off that option and try to text, a sign in comes up and puts it back to iMessage. \nI am nowhere near a \"genius\", and the two hour drive to them once was totally unsatisfactory.  Siri found this site for me.  I have my fingers crossed.\n\nA: You said you had to change your Apple ID email associated with your account. I just want to make sure you signed out of the old one and signed in with the new email address under \"Settings > Messages > Send & Receive\" on both devices. After you do this, uncheck Settings > Messages > iMessage, wait 15 minutes and check it again.\n", "Q: Why can't I see my latest photos when I try to add a picture to facebook? I just imported a bunch of photos from my iphone 6 to my mac book and I have migrated to the new Photos app.  When I go into the Photos app, I do see these pictures that have been imported but when I go to another app (like facebook) and try to add a photo to a post, I go into Media => Photos and none of the newly uploaded photos are showing up. \nI am not sure if this is related to migrating from IPhoto to Photos on the mac but any suggestion or explanations on what could be going wrong here?\n\nA: After rebooting, the pictures showed up\n", "Q: iTunes U plays previous video when trying to open reading material I'm having a strange problem with iTunes U (in iTunes). When I click on a non-video item in the lecture feed, it simply plays the last video.\nThe item I'm trying to view is clearly not a video, as indicated by the book-symbol:\n\nBut in this example, when I click \"Reading: The Rest of Swift\", it simply plays \"9. Scroll View and Multithreading\".\nI'm using a mac running OSX Yosemite, so there shouldn't be any problems with that.\nWhy is this happening then?\n\nA: The solution seems to be to first download the item, and then it will open properly.\n", "Q: Adding a new contact in iOS 8 merges it with a homonymous old contact I have in my iPhone iOS 8 and old contact called Salvador. This old contact has his mobile, and some notes, and that is fine.\nToday I select a phone number from my call history and select the add a new contact option. I enter the name contact as Salvador and add a note to this new contact.\nThe problem is when I recall from my contact app the Salvador name, it only appears once (I'm supposed to have an Old Salvador and the new Salvador as a contact) when I select the Salvador contact the info inside is a combination of the phone and notes of the old Salvador and the phone and notes of the new Salvador.\nWhy is this happening?\n\nA: You cannot have more than one contact with the same name in your iPhone so it sounds like your iPhone is merging them together. Try adding a last name/nick name to have them as two separate contacts. \n", "Q: Is there a maximum number of files supported/recommended in Photos.app? With the new OS X Photos app released in OS X 10.10.3, is there a hard limit to the maximum number of files (either photos or videos) that the app will support? Or is there a limit to the maximum size of the library? Or are there recommended limits defined by Apple? \nBasically, how well will Photos handle large libraries, and is there a certain point where it would be smart to split a library into multiple libraries?\n\nA: My Photos library has about 60,000 photos and about 1,600 movies. The total size is about 560GB. About 30,000 photos are uploaded to iCloud and can be browsed by all my devices and desktop machines. So far no problems and interaction is fluid. With old iPhotos it was annoyingly slow to view the library in its entirety and had to split it into yearly libraries. New Photos does not seem to slow down with library size. It's face recognition is also quite a bit better.\n\nA: There is no confirmed limit, according to Apple. You can add large libraries, and the only limit is your hard disk free space.\n", "Q: Mac - switch all desktops at once I can use  Ctrl ⌃   and the left/right arrows to switch individual desktops on a multiscreen system but can you switch all of them at once?\n\nA: Only by disabling \"Displays have separate Spaces\"\nSystem Prefs > Mission Control\n\n", "Q: Set iPhone volume to maximum when connecting to a Bluetooth speaker Normally I like to keep my iPhone volume quite low, so that when audio plays, it isn't too loud at first.\nHowever, when I connect my iPhone to a Bluetooth speaker, I want the iPhone's volume to be maximum, so that the audio that gets outputted to the speakers isn't too soft, and I can from then on control the audio with the speakers instead of the iPhone.\nIs it possible to have the iPhone automatically increase its volume to maximum only when connecting to Bluetooth speakers?\nFor instance, when attaching headphones to the iPhone, it has a different volume setting for them, versus without headphones. I'd like something similar when connecting Bluetooth speakers.\n\nA: Some Bluetooth speakers use the phone volume control to determine the speaker volume which is much simpler than having 2 independent volumes. It works both ways too, if using volume buttons on the speaker then the iPhone volume slider updates instantly. Its similar to how using line-out was better than headphone for connecting speakers via a cable in the old days. I'd suggest trying a speaker with that feature and see if it works better for you, like the Anker Sound Core Sport for example. The Amazon Echo and Sony devices don't have it unfortunately. I'm not sure if it remembers the volume level but think it does.\nUpdate:\nThis feature is called Absolute Volume Control and was added in the Bluetooth spec AVRCP v1.4 so look for devices that support that.\n\nA: Bluetooth volume is set independently of internal speaker volume.\nSame control, the +/- buttons on the side of the iDevice, but once you are streaming to bluetooth, the actual control is then adjusting Bluetooth send volume, not speaker volume.\n", "Q: How to slow down video, but not sound on the clip in iMovie? I have a clip I want to show with slow motion. That clip has a soundtrack, but I need to slow only video without sound? Is it possible?\n\nA: Split the audio from the video with Detach Audio (⌥⌘B), then you can retime the video independently.\n\nA: You can right click on the clip you wish to edit, and then detach the audio.  You can now manipulate the video without affecting the sound.\n", "Q: How to join split clips back in iMovie? After I split clip, now I have two parts of one clip. However my split was very useful, now I prefer to join it back, but my option to join clips is greyed out.

I've tried this connection and the computers are not visible to one another.\n\nA: In the Network Preferences panel there should be a listing for thunderbolt bridge. If there is not click on the \"+\" button at the bottom of the left-hand pane and add it to both Macs.\nYou can leave the setting on DHCP and they should both get an IP address in the range of 169.254.x.x. Make sure each is different.\nYou should now be able to go into terminal and ping the other Mac from each. Once you have verified that, just go into the Finder's \"Go\" menu and \"connect to server\".

Instead, I get a continuous \"screen-zoom\" effect (similar to holding Control and scrolling), inside the Chrome window (as opposed to the actual screen-zoom, which is independent of the application). Chrome's usual zoom controls still work, but I have to access them either by keyboard shortcut or clicking the respective buttons.\nThere are several down-sides: the resolution does not update, so my zoomed-in PDF is unnecessarily grainy, and I cannot use horizontal scrolling to navigate, only vertical. Further, the zoom happens wherever the cursor is, rather than centered in the page. Finally, there is a fixed upper bound to how far I can zoom in. This is all rather strange and unwieldily; how can I recover the original behavior?\nI am using OSX 10.9.5, and the most recent version of Chrome. All four \"Scroll and Zoom\" options under Trackpad in System Preferences are active. If I deactivate 'Pinch to zoom', instead of recovering the old behavior, nothing happens when I pinch. \nThanks for your help!\n\nA: As a \"workaround\" to this issue, you can download BetterTouchTool and remap these gestures in Chrome:\n\n\n*\n\n*A \"pinch in\" to ⌘–\n\n*A \"pinch out\" to ⌘+\nThat should \"solve\" your problem.\n\nA: As of September 2015, this is a bug in newer versions of Chrome that the Chrome team is aware of. [I do not know the status since then]\nThe alternatives are to use the zoom button in the lower right, a different browser, or take the pdf out of chrome into adobe reader.\n", "Q: Deleting photos on iOS7? For some reason whenever I delete a photo on my camera roll, the corresponding photo on iCloud photo stream would also be deleted. Am I going crazy here? I thought the whole point of photo stream is to back up your photos so you don't have to keep them on your phone?\nAlso, is it normal that photos on iCloud are displayed as taking up my phone's space in settings -> usage? For example it says \"camera roll: 551mb\", \"photo library: 0\" and \"photo stream: 390mb\". Why are photos in iCloud taking up space on my phone, and why is not everything backed up (390mb vs 551mb)?\n\nA: I believe you are misunderstanding how My Photo Stream works. It is intended as a temporary (up to 30 days or 1000 photos at any given time) mechanism to allow each photo you take to sync to each of your devices - iOS, Mac and Windows. There is also a limit of 1000 photos in My Photo Stream at any given time. As new photos are uploaded, older ones are deleted.\n\"Why is not everything backed up\": If you have more than 1000 photos in your Camera Roll, the oldest X (greater than 1000) photos will no longer appear in My Photo Stream. Similarly, photos older than 30 days will be removed. Again, My Photo Stream is not a backup service. This could explain storage size discrepancies, as could the fact that videos are not uploaded to My Photo Stream.\n\"Why are photos in iCloud taking up space on my phone\": My Photo Stream stores a copy of each photo that is in the stream on your device. Generally speaking, an identical photo that is in multiple places should only take up space once on your device - if the same 100KB photo is in Camera Roll and My Photo Stream, there are two pointers to the same 100KB file on the device, instead of having two files that are 100KB each. That said, the storage is not freed up until all pointers are removed from the device. If you delete a 100KB photo from Camera Roll, but it still exists in Photo Stream, that 100KB will still be used.\nAlso, if you have started or joined any shared Photo Streams, that will take up space as well.\n", "Q: How do I get image \"FILES\" off my iPhone with Photos? Until recently (2/2015) when I plugged in my iphone to my mac the Image Capture app would auto launch. I could then select all the images and drag them to a folder in the finder.\nIn 3/2015 apple replaced Image Capture with Photos. How do I get my files out of Photos? I have ZERO interest in using Photos to organize my images. I just want the raw .jpg, .mp4 files from my camera.\nThe first thing I tried was selecting them in Photos and picking Export but that DOES NOT GIVE ME THE ORIGINAL IMAGE FILES. Instead if writes new files. They all have the time stamp of the moment they were exported out of Photos, not the original time stamp of when they were taken like I used to get out of Image Capture.\nHow do I get my raw image files out of my iPhone now?\n\nA: I found that Image Capture is still available and I can set it to be the default to launch when I plugin in my iphone as well.\nTo do that run Image Capture (click the search icon in the top right of the menu bar and type Image Capture.\nThen in the bottom left there is the option for what should happen when your phone is connected.\n\n", "Q: Find which Chrome Tab is using Significant Energy Under the Energy Monitor in Yosemite, it shows Chrome having the highest energy impact. Is it possible to figure out which Chrome tab is the one that is consuming the most energy?\n\n\nA: Right click the table headers (App Name, Energy Impact, etc.) and check Process ID. Now you can see the PIDs associated with that Energy Impact values. \nNext, click the 'customize/options' button in Chrome (it's the triple horizontal stripes button next to the URL bar) and go to More Tools > Task Manager, which brings up Chrome's internal task manager. In there you'll find the different Chrome threads (including running extensions and open tabs) with their names and PIDs. \nYou can then cross reference the PIDs between Chrome's task manager and Yosemite's Activity Monitor.\n\nA: This isn't an answer to your specific question... but I think I have a pretty good solution for you for tabs eating up memory :) After putting in real work and time with 4 different browsers over the course of about 6 days, noting my device's performance under normal working conditions, and being flexible with workflows in each browser, I came back to Chrome.\nI continued searching high and low for an answer to my dilemma with no luck because my 2017 Macbook Pro was... about to be tossed out my fifth story apartment. I ultimately came up with my own little solution, implementing two wonderful plugins. They also added some benefits that I didn't even know I needed, which is something that'll help you automatically saving your windows' state of tabs, while also along you to save collections of tabs manually.\nI don't know how I've survived this long...\n\"Chrome Tab Hoarder\" and \"Memory Efficiency\" Achievements Unlocked!\nConfession - I knew my memory issues were caused by the fact that I had 15 browser tabs open. I can have triple that open now, no problem.\nGet the Toby Chrome extension to automatically save any and all browsing window states whether your computer stroked out or you quit Chrome on purpose. It's even better than what I was originally searching for because you can save (and edit at any point) Collections of tabs. This is by far my most used and favorite thing that I've discovered in 2020 (along with my web design software, Figma, and upgraded web development workflow).\nThe perfect companion extension for Toby is called The Great Suspender. It will cause you to yell at the sky screaming profanities a lot less because your computer will run SO much better. Suspended tabs use significantly less energy and memory. If you have tabs open and don't use them within 30 minutes, it'll stay there in your tabs, but be suspended and not use resources. When you click on the tab, it reloads. It won't suspend any tabs that have input fields with information in them or ones that actively play videos or sounds. You have options to not suspend any tabs from a particular domain, particular URLs (I don't suspend Gmail, ClickUp, and some others), customize the amount of time before suspending a tab, etc\nI hope this helps some people! It may sound like a lot but give it an honest couple of days and see what you think, especially those of us who are tab hoarders .\nI literally have 46 tabs open right now between two different windows - oops  My 3-year-old MacBook Pro has that plus Photoshop and 6 other open apps. My embarrassing number of tabs (let's not talk about it) wasn't even a possibility before, neither was saving them.\n", "Q: How can I teach Siri how to spell my child's name correctly in texts? When I text my husband something like \"I picked up Hailey from school and am on my way,\" Siri always misspells my daughter's name as Haley (with no \"i\"). I have an entry in my contact info identifying who my daughter is, but when I'm dictating a text or other message, that appears to be irrelevant. \nI'd like to teach Siri that any time I refer to my child's name it should always be spelled a certain way. I feel foolish sending messages with my own child's name misspelled.\n\nA: One possible solution, though it may backfire if you ever do want to spell Anne with the e…\nGo to Settings > General > Keyboards > Shortcuts & add a new shortcut from the + key, top right.  \nAdd -\nPhrase Anne\nShortcut Ann\nI haven't tested it for this particular instance, but it's worth a try.\n\nA: \nSiri isn't the brightest bulb in the box and she often misunderstands\n  unusual words and names. Fortunately, you can teach her how to speak\n  properly by adding phonetic pronunciations to your contacts.\nHow do you do this? Watch this video or follow these\n  instructions:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open up your uniquely-named contact and tap the Edit button up top. \n  \n*Scroll down to the bottom of the contact page and find the area that\n  says \"Add New Field.\" \n  \n*From your options, choose \"Phonetic First\n  Name\" (or \"Phonetic Last Name,\" depending on which one is the\n  problem). \n  \n*Enter in the phonetic version of the problematic name and\n  tap Save. Now when you ask Siri to recognize or say a name, she'll\n  get it right.\n  \n\nSource: Teach Siri to Correctly Recognize and Pronounce Names in Your Address Book\n\nA: My son's name is spelled Zach… and not Zack as Siri likes to do… here's how to fix it.\nOpen the contact for this person, press the Edit button, scroll to the bottom and press \"+\" next to Add Field, select Nickname. Here type in the spelling that you want Siri to use. Press the Done button and try Siri again.\n\nA: I figured it out! In contacts under the name, write the name in quotation marks. Then Siri knows you \"are to be called that\". It worked for me after I did the shortcut you described here. In other words, first change the shortcut from Haley to Hailey, then put \"Hailey\" under her name in your contacts.\n\nA: I've found (with iOS 16.0 at least) that Siri understands a particular spelling if you say the letters.\nSo it works to say in a text message:\n\n\"I picked H-A-I-L-E-Y up and I'm on my way\"\n\nI know it's not a workaround you'll want to use every time you mention your daughter, but it might come in handy in some cases.\n(NB: use the normal English letter names - so to get Hailey say 'aitch-ai-eye-ell-ee-why'. The NATO phonetic alphabet doesn't seem to work)\n\nA: I've done it for both of my girls unusual names. I added them as keyboard shortcuts so when I type jai then Jaida automatically pops up and ay brings up Ayanna. I also taught Siri the correct way to pronounce both their names and added the phonetic spelling, which helped with talk to text recognition. \n\nA: If you make a contact with the person's name and then add the phonetic name on the contact it will work.

No my Time Machine Backup uses about 2.3TB space. That's not cool.\n\n*I can't set a quota to the Synology user, because it beginns to count starting zero.\n\n\nWhat I want to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*If anyhow possible I want to tell my Time Machine Backup to shrink automatically to a limit of ~1.5TB by deleting the oldest backups.\n\n*Then I want the sparse bundle to not get bigger anymore.\n\n\nDoes anyone of you see a solution? Or do I have to delete all my old backups to reach my goal?\n\nA: Time Machine will respect a size determination - but only when you make the container. This functionality is all that Apple provides for native backup so you'd need a custom setup to do what you ask, and you can't limit things once you've started backing up to a container.\nGoing forward if you want to make a new restricted container, the concept isn't hard to map out though.\n\n\n*\n\n*make a new container on the synology and be sure to enforce the size constraints when you start the process. \n\n\nServer.app does that easily - I'm not aware of synology code that reverse engineered that feature, but would be surprised if it's not on GitHub or published somewhere public.\nAt that point, you could delete all backups of user folders that are large and then block by block copy the old backup data to the new destination and then inherit the backup.\nYou can also thin backup intervals from the command line or script this automation as well.\nLots and lots of work, but it might be worth it as a project if someone is inclined.\nWhen I'm in your shoes, I just copy off the old \"too large\" backup to an offline hard drive and put it on a shelf and start over with new backups of the size you like. In 6 months or a year - wipe that old drive unless you really feel you need that older history.\n\nA: This is the easiest solution using OSX Terminal.\nGet a list of all the backups in TimeMachine. This will also show you the full directory path to the backups that you will need in step 2...\n\n$ tmutil listbackups\n\n/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/{your-macbook}/2018-10-02-213405\n/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/{your-macbook}/2018-10-09-192323\n/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/{your-macbook}/2018-10-19-212659\n\nChoose which backups to delete based on their date. Note the use of a wildcard * and the use of the directory from step 1. For example, to delete all of 2018's backups you would use this:\n\n$sudo tmutil delete '/Volumes/Time Machine\n  Backups/Backups.backupdb/{your-macbook}/2018-'*\n\nThe final step is to shrink and recover space from the sparse bundle. Search your backup drive for the .sparsebundle file. \n\n$ sudo hdiutil compact '/Volumes/{your-mac}.sparsebundle'\n\n\nA: Shrink the backup volume to the desired size. Time Machine is designed to keep adding backups until the volume is full, then prune older copies. It is NOT designed to share storage space with other things, nor to leave X gigabytes free on the destination.\n\nA: I agree with the answer given earlier, though what you could try is to manually delete Time Machine backups (at your own risk).\nIf you mount the volume, there is a folder called \"Backups.backupdb\" (it may be looking slightly different on remote backups).  Inside it will have your computer name and then either the dates or the volumes, or vice versa (sorry, I am currently away from my own Mac and cannot check the exact order).\nIf you remove some earlier date folders, you will free up some space in order to resize the volume.\nNOTE: Keep in mind that Time Machine is an incremental backup using hardlinks for unchanged files.  So, removing one date folder, may not remove the amount of space it states to be sized at.\n\nA: momomo.com.apple.timemachine.backups.list() {\n        tmutil listbackups\n}\nmomomo.com.apple.timemachine.backups.compact() {\n        local leave=\"${1}\";\n\n        if [[ \"${leave}\" == \"\" ]]; then leave=\"5\"; fi\n\n        local backups=(\n                $(momomo.com.apple.timemachine.backups.list)\n        )\n\n        local length=\"${#backups[@]}\"\n        local     to=\"((\"${length}\"-\"${leave}\"))\"\n\n        local i=0; while [[ \"${i}\" -lt \"${to}\"  ]]; do\n                local backup=\"${backups[i]}\"\n\n                sudo tmutil delete \"${backup}\"\n\n                echo -e \"\\n\\n\"\n\n                ((++i))\n        done   \n}\n\nExample: \n# To leave last 10 on disk and remove all previous before\nmomomo.com.apple.timemachine.backups.compact 10 \n\nCan be called repeatedly. \n    Deleting: /Volumes/backupdisk-1/Backups.backupdb/m-desktop-2/2019-12-21-001329\n    Deleted (4.6G): /Volumes/backupdisk-1/Backups.backupdb/m-desktop-2/2019-12-21-001329\n    Total deleted: 4.6G\n\n    Deleting: /Volumes/backupdisk-1/Backups.backupdb/m-desktop-2/2019-12-28-001355\n    Deleted (5.1G): /Volumes/backupdisk-1/Backups.backupdb/m-desktop-2/2019-12-28-001355\n    Total deleted: 5.1G\n\n    Deleting: /Volumes/backupdisk-1/Backups.backupdb/m-desktop-2/2020-01-04-001349\n    Deleted (6.6G): /Volumes/backupdisk-1/Backups.backupdb/m-desktop-2/2020-01-04-001349\n    Total deleted: 6.6G\n\n    Deleting backup: /Volumes/backupdisk-1/Backups.backupdb/m-desktop-2/2020-01-11-002303\n    ...\n\n", "Q: What does AirPlay need from wifi and router? I have been using AirPlay to an Airport Express connected to my HiFi very successfully for years. My router and main wifi access point were Apple AirPort Extreme - so it was all Apple to Apple and it worked.\nNow I have just installed a new Virgin Broadband Super Hub 2ac (it's a customised Netgear cable modem router with built-in wifi) and for reasons of local layout I have set it up as router and as a wifi access point. It works very well. I have put the old AirPort Extreme into bridge mode so it just serves as a switch, and have reset the Airport Express to join the new wireless network.\nEverything works well except AirPlay. Even AirPlay sometimes works - but mostly it fails. The Airport Express AirPlay service is always visible from my iPhone, but trying to play music through it just usually fails. \nThe Virgin media forums have several stories of \"AirPlay doesn't work with my Virgin Super hub\" - and the consensus response seems to be \"don't use the Super hub as a router\". This seems to me to be defeatist.\nThere must be some requirement of AirPlay that the router or wifi service isn't satisfying. What is it? What does AirPlay need? Some particular protocol? Some special wifi setting?\n\nA: AirPlay uses the following ports:\n\n\n*\n\n*TCP 80 - http\n\n*TCP 443 - https\n\n*TCP/UDP 554 - rstp\n\n*TCP 3689 - daap\n\n*UDB 5353 - mDNS\n\n\nData from https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202944 - TCP and UDP ports used by Apple software products and TCP and UDP ports and protocols used by Apple TV\nHere's how to test ports and also an AirPort centric setup guide \n", "Q: Why do I sometimes see a downloading 'pie' icon when viewing photostream photos? it normally shows in the bottom corner as a sort of 'pie' that fills up as the picture is downloaded, similar to the 'app downloading' pie when viewing a downloading app on the home page/s\nprior to this the picture resolution is terrible\n\nA: That device has only a thumbnail and is indicating the progress fetching a higher resolution image.\nFrom Apple KB - My Photo Stream FAQ\n\nWhat resolution are My Photo Stream photos? \nOn a Mac or PC, your photos are downloaded and stored in full resolution. On iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV, your photos are delivered in a device-optimized resolution that speeds downloads and saves storage space. Dimensions will vary, but an optimized version of a photo taken by a standard point-and-shoot camera will have a 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution when pushed to your devices. Panoramic photos can be up to 5400 pixels wide.\n\n", "Q: How has OS X's Photos app determined people's names under the 'Faces' album? It has determined a number of faces (as you would expect from any facial recognition software) but it has also figured out the names, despite me never having entered any\n\nA: It has access to the face data in your contacts, such as from syncing with Facebook. So, it's found similarities to those pictures.\n", "Q: What is the maximum/optimized size of the OSX photos.app library? I was using aperture with referenced images. The aperture library is about 20gig, the folder containing the referenced images is 200gig. I exported versions of a selection of my pictures (6000) and imported those into photos.app for a trial run. The settings (checked) in photos.app are: iCloud Photo Library, Optimized Mac Storage, My Photo Stream, iCloud Photo Sharing.\n\nRight now my Photos Library has a size of 23gig. Which is used mainly for Masters as seen below: \n\nWhen checking my iCloud-Setting (in System Preferences) the size of photos in the cloud is 16gig. \n\nI use a MacBookAir(late2010) right now with 128gig of storage. So I was hoping photos.app would upload all the pictures in full-res to the cloud and keep low-res pictures locally. Right now it seems the local copy is even larger. I had my mac book on wifi (and connected to power) for some days now (only 78 pictures left for upload).\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the target size Photos.app is optimizing for?\n\n*Is there any way to change/adapt this target size?\n\n\nA: Create a partition to the photo library dedicated, if you create a new photo library in there, and the maximum size is limited to the partition size. Of the 500GB of system drive, are using divided into partitions for the photo library of 50GB (10%).\nI have a picture of 200GB on icloud, are used without any problems with the above settings.\n\nA: I practice, the optimize space has zero effect on your photo library on OS X initially.\nWhen you enable a system Photos library and opt in to the iCloud Photo storage, it tells the Photos Agent background process to start uploading photos to the cloud. When that initial pass is done, then deduplication in the cloud and download of new photos starts.\nAssuming your Mac has room for the original photos - nothing gets optimized. Also, nothing gets optimized until the original is stored in iCloud.\nOnce your Mac runs into a storage issue on the volume where the Photos files are stored, it will start to optimize the local copies and reduce the amount of space needed so that the drive can have free space for other files.\nI haven't seen Apple document these low storage space limits and I also haven't determined it empirically. Similarly, I don't have documented or empirical data on how far \"optimization\" will go and if at some point an error will be raised if photos cannot be compressed further.\nI'm sure the code handles all of the above, but I don't have details on that.\nAs to your two specific items, it seems the software is smart enough to handle even your case where the library is large enough to have optimization happen before upload is finished.\nI would say that I've seen it take 24 hours post upload to start reconciliation and download, so my guess is you might have to wait a while for the space savings to kick in as well as have Photos on a volume with low free space as an additional factor.\n\nA: After about 2 weeks of working with the Photos app on a Macbook Air 128GB, with a much larger photos library, I've noticed the following things.\nThere appears to be no fixed target size for the actual Photos library - instead its a target \"free\" space on my Macbook Air.\nCurrently, the Mac Optimisation appears to target roughly 10% free space on my Macbook (about 12GB)\nObviously you can only upload up to 12GB, but as soon as the import process begins, the Mac starts to re-allocate storage as it imports the photos to the Mac, and then begins uploading to iCloud.\nIt's a lengthy process importing 100's GBs of photos, but it should be possible.\nMy Photos library totals around 40GB on my MacBook Air\nHope that sheds some light... at least a little.\n\nA: So after some time (learning python on how to monitor and plot library size and disk usage) this is what I have observed regarding my first question. As written by @will-mallard and @bmike the optimizer targes for percentage free disk space. As shown below: the size of the picture library increases and decreases together with my disk usage. During those three days I did not use my mac book air for work. I only added pictures two times.\n\nOver a longer time scale, one can see the reduction of picture library disc space over time while I was working on my macbook.\n\nMy followup question is now:\nWhat triggers the optimization? At first I thought it is some kind of free space threshold. But as it is easily seen in the last plot, something at the 24th May triggered a reduction of library space. I am not sure what that was.\n\nA: The size of your local Photos library is not necessarily indicative of the size of the photos stored on iCloud Photo Library. My local library is 83GB (of which 24GB is Masters) and the full-resolution uploads on iCloud Photo Library take up ~25GB.\nGiven that you still have some items to upload, and there could be discrepancies in how space is being reported (1000MB in a GB vs 1024MB in a GB etc), your Masters folder seems approximately correct versus what is reported in iCloud Photo Library.\n", "Q: iOS app for simultaneous reading and listening to a (audio) book I'd like to read books in a foreign language while listening to its Audiobook version.

It's available on their Kindle Fire tablets.\n\n*A plus would be if I could tap a word to see its translation.\n\n*It does not so much matter what books are available.

I recently upgraded my Macbook to OS X 10.9.5 and tried to update the drivers for my Tascam but they don't seem to be installing correctly.

Consequently, I'm not currently able to use the device. \nI have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver several times but it makes no difference. I have also tested this on another computer running Mavericks and it seems to work fine, so I don't think it's a conflict with the operating system. Somebody suggested that perhaps there is a conflict with traces of the previous driver still on the system. Is there anyone who can tell me how to check this or offer any other suggestions? Tascam were unable to help.\nYours hopefully,\nM\n\nA: I don't have any experience with the specific drivers, but here is how I would attack the problem.\nI would get a USB drive with a Mac partition I can wipe - it should be 20 GB or so (10 might work as well) and I'd download a clean OS installer from the App Store and install a clean OS onto that test partition.\nYou can use startup disk preference pane to switch between OS and then don't restore any files to the test OS. Just make a test account and apply all upgrades recommended by Tascam (10.9.5 or whatever) and then install just the driver.\nYou'll then have a clean system to know if the issue is Tascam's to resolve and/or know you can try again with different OS levels if the issue is really a driver-OS compatibility issue.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi network created but not allowing connection to the Internet I am able to create the Wi-Fi signal through my MacBook Pro, though it doesn't connect to internet when I use it in other devices.\nI am using OS X Yosemite and I tried to use the Wi-Fi created from my Mac in my Lenovo tablet and Samsung smartphone.\nI called Apple service and they say they cannot help for I am not using Apple tablet and Apple smartphone.\n\nA: The first thing to try is to enable Internet Sharing from System Preferences -> Sharing.\n\nNow choose the right source and destination, connect your device to WiFi shared network and try to navigate.\n", "Q: No AirDrop option on iPhone 4s I have an iPhone 4s running iOS 8.3.

I have notifications in the OSX Notification Center, as for most of my apps I am using the setting, \"Show in Notification Centre: 10 Recent Items\"\nThis is a good setting but rather than have a very full Notification Center, I would still like to clear it from time to time with 1 click.\nI am using Yosemite 10.10.3\n\nA: Another option, which uses Keyboard Maestro to run an Applescript is detailed here: http://genuinecuriosity.com/unnotify\nI have it mapped so that I hit Command Option 0 to clear all open alert dialogs.\nBasically, I have created an Applescript to click the first button on all open alerts (typically Close), and does that until all alerts are cleared. You can use the Applescript directly through Keyboard Maestro (as described in my article), or you can create a Service with Automator (this is a little more finicky due to Accessibility permissions requirements).\nThe full Applescript is included in the article, along with a screen grab showing the setup in Keyboard Maestro.\n\n\nA: I know this was originally for Yosemite, and I'm not sure the answer there, but given the question is 3 years old, and I just found it while looking for the same thing with Mojave, I thought I'd mention the answer I found.\n\non the very right of the menu bar, click on the 3 lines, this brings up a window with Today / Notifications tabs.

This is useful in particular if you have dozens of notifications from the Finder that can't be quickly closed using other approaches.\nFrom Terminal:\nps -e | grep /NotificationCenter | grep app | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill -9\nThis is similar to Joey's answer, except it does it all in one command. ps -e gets a list of running processes. The grep filters the list to those containing /NotificationCenter. This list still has too many items because the grep command itself ends up finding itself. We exclude it by running another grep on the output of that list. The awk command prints the first column, which is the process id that we need to restart. Xargs takes the output of the previous command and feeds it to its arguments, namely, \"kill -9\" which is the unix command to exit a process.\nThe practical outcome is that the NotificationCenter.app is stopped. Launchd (the system process that launches other system processes) notices that Notification Center went away, and reinitiates it. When it comes back, all the messages in its queue are lost and your notifications are cleared.\n\nA: The small X in El Capitan is in the notification window. Open the Notification pane by sliding in from the right on the mouse or clicking on the notification center icon in the upper left corner. Each application's notifications are grouped together and there is a little X on the right side of each application's header.

Instead, this answer explains alternative ways to dismiss them that are not noted elsewhere in this thread.\nTwo-finger swipe right on the notification group works on Big Sur with the Macbook's trackpad (not sure about Yosemite). It also works with left-click and drag to the right. I assume this would work with an Apple Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad as well.\nThis doesn't \"clear\" all notifications permanently. They will still show if you open the notification sidebar. They will also show if another message comes through; instead of seeing 1 notification it will show N + 1 notifications available.\nThis thread is similar to Dismiss MacOS Big Sur notifications with keyboard.\n\nA: Run in Terminal:\nkillall NotificationCenter\n\nA: Change the annoying notification app in the notifications preferences, from \"alerts\" to \"banners\".

I have a MacBook Pro Mid-2009 running Yosemite 10.10.3, and I installed Macs Fan Control which is similar to smcFanControl. Basically, whenever I put my Mac to sleep the fans stop spinning (I have them set at 6200rpm) and the Mac is asleep but less than a minute into sleep mode the fans start spinning again (I can tell since they start at 6200rpm) but the screen is still off. Is my Mac really going to sleep or does the fact that the fans are spinning mean that it's not asleep. By the way I have wake for network access turned off.\n\nA: Fan function is regulated by temperature sensors.\nAs long the temperature is to high the fan keeps working regardless if you are in sleep mode or not. Since you turned off the heat source that action is usually very short.\nSomewhat like you car fan, that continues to spin even if you turn off the engine if the temperature is to high.\n", "Q: Use one modifier key as multiple modifier keys?

However when I create a shared album, I get the photos on Photos on my Mac.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I tried Photo Library briefly and had a similar problem. The progress bar would go to about 40% then disappear. The problem for me was a lack of storage space, and so it would just fail at a certain point. Go to General > iCloud > Storage to check the amount of space available on your iCloud account, then check the amount your photos take up (I believe this can only be done in iTunes). If the photos don't fit in the available space either buy more space or just turn off the feature as it wastes battery if it is not actually being useful.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro goes black for a second or two and then comes back on My MacBook Pro (mid 2012) 15″ goes black for a second or two while I'm using it and then comes back on as soon as I touch the trackpad, or sometimes it comes back on its own. It's very sporadic. Why is this happening and how can I prevent it?\n\nA: That actually sounds like an intermittent connection caused by a broken wire/conductor, or a bad solder joint. Essentially, you have two ends of a conductor that should be joined, but mild vibration is causing them to make/break contact, causing the symptoms you describe.\nHowever, you should confirm that your screen saver settings aren't set to turn on after a very short duration.\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences >> Desktop & Screen Saver >> Screen Saver tab.\n\n*At the bottom-left, try setting Start after = Never\nBTW, if you want easy method to manually enable the screen saver, click Hot Corners and set a corner for Start Screen Saver.\nIt would be good news if just the screen saver is causing the blank screen.\nOtherwise, you should send the macbook in for repairs (when you have a break from needing it).\n", "Q: In Keynote, how can I simulate magic move between different images?

I use magic move for most slide transitions in my presentation, but obviously that doesn't work for the different images. Is it possible to tell Keynote that the images should be related somehow? If not, what's the best way to \"fake\" the magic move for these images?\n\nA: In essence, you want both objects on both slides, overlapping, then animate the opacity between the two with Magic Move.

In the US, you have to be careful when ordering parts from Amazon since not all are actually sold by Amazon and instead are sold through that market from various third party sellers.

I just want to transfer these two tracks to an mp3 player and I'm not sure how to do that from my iPad where the two tracks were originally downloaded. I was able to do so with most of the other tracks, but these two won't work. \n\nA: Generally the iCloud symbol in your library means the file has yet to be downloaded, therefore it's absence also generally means that the file has been downloaded and is locally present. Try downloading the ones with iCloud symbols then doing your transfer.\nIf I am misinterpreting this and you can't transfer the files at all, whilst your iPad is connected there is a \"Transfer Purchases\" button under File > Devices in iTunes's menu bar to transfer files directly.\n", "Q: After disabling iCloud Photo Library, cannot re-enable due to insufficient iCloud Storage In an attempt to troubleshoot an apparently \"stuck\" upload process with iCloud Photo Library, I tried a suggestion I read about in Apple's own forums: Disable and then Re-Enable iCloud Photo Library.\nUnfortunately, after doing so, I've apparently run into an unforeseen edge case from Apple. My iPhone refuses to re-enable iCloud Photo Library due to insufficient iCloud storage. The assumption from iCloud seems to be that all my local photos would be \"new\" to iCloud. In reality, my iCloud storage is adequate, since all my local photos should be detected as duplicates and not actually added to the iCloud Photo Library.\nAt the moment, it appears my only option is to upgrade my storage just for the purpose of re-enabling this feature.

The first Photos Library that is created is the System Photos Library, you can't designate a new Photos Library to be the System Photos Library. See link below.  I suppose you could completely move the System Photos Library off of your drive (or Archive it in Finder the remove it) and then create a new System Photos Library to sync the iCloud photos down to, but I haven't tested that yet.  This seems to still be a huge problem that needs to be addressed. Temporarily logging out of iCloud on a Mac should definitely not require an entire Photos library re-download, it should just resync. \nhttps://help.apple.com/photos/mac/1.2/index.html?localePath=en.lproj#/pht211de786\n\nA: You could delete all the photos locally before reenabling the iCloud Photo Library.\nThat is, only if you're absolutely sure that all your photos are in iCloud.\nThen, with an empty local library, reenable iCloud Photo Library on the device.\n\nA: Turn on iCloud photo library in System Preferences and allow Optimise Storage.

Take the contents of that users Library/Preferences folder and put it in another folder on the desktop. and reboot normally. If that fixes it one of the many preference files was corrupt. If not...\nThen there may be something installed in that user's account that is doing something bad. Go into System Preferences -> Users and remove the startup items for that user and reboot.\nThere are a lot of things that this could be. And it is a matter of finding what is unique to one user account that is crashing. It's a lot of fiddly, annoying investigations. It might be easier to just create a new user account, move only the necessary stuff to the new user profile and delete the old one.\n\nA: Yosemite reinstall might fix that, but if you have some crazy app it might kill it again. \nI assume you did the Apple Hardware test, but since one user works i doubt that.\nIf it does, try loading in Safe mode (to exclude non apple apps), and if it hangs it might be a apple stuff.\nIf necessary, start in Verbose mode to see where it hangs up with the trouble account.\nYou can use the working account to access the broken account and save your files as described here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/164715/46541\n\nA: I have the OS X 10.11.1 server and while setting up users, set them to share only.

I used a Flash install of Yosemite to get the OX onto the new hard drive.\nAfter completion, I was able to successfully boot to that hard drive on my desktop via the USB to SATA cable.\nI went ahead and then swapped the drives in the laptop and booted it up.  At about 30% the start up hangs on the grey screen with the apple logo.  I tried booting into recovery, and it hangs at about 20%, never successfully loading the recovery.\nSo far I've reset the PRAM, and tried booting directly into recovery via. Command+R and also using the option key to select the recovery directly.  I've also tried to boot directly from the flash drive OSX install, but it doesn't seem to work on the machine.  However, I can successfully boot the flash drive on two different desktop machines.\nStarting to run out of ideas on how to make this work, I'm extremely perplexed as to why the SSD and Flash Drive boots just fine on my desktop, but not in the Laptop.\nEdit: My assumption is that there's some sort of incompatibility with the hardware and OSX 10.10.1, I'm going to try a boot of Mavericks from a flash drive I'm creating now and see where that gets us.\nSecond Edit: Apparently RAM I installed months ago didn't want to play nice with the new SDD.  Switching back to the old ram got the computer to boot no problem.  (Weird, because I previously had no issues with the RAM before upgrading the SDD)\n\nA: Apparently RAM I installed months ago didn't want to play nice with the new SDD.

How do I check from where they were removed?\nI've Tried 'Get Info', but it doesn't tell me from where it was removed. The only option I've is 'Put Back', but again, to where?\nHow do I check this on OS X 10.9?\n\nA: Based on the previous information, the information about original location is stored within DS_Store file. In older version of OS X it was just a plain text and now binary format and it's undocumented by Apple, however there is a tool created by Wim L which can reads it.\nWritten in perl Mac::Finder::DSStore project provides routines for reading and writing the .DS_Store files generated by the OS X.\nUsing examples/dsstore_dump.pl would attempt to dump a store file's records in a more human-readable format.\nExample usage:\n$ perl dsstore_dump.pl ~/.Trash/.DS_Store\n\n    &makeEntries(\"foo.png\",\n        ptbL => \"Users/username/Desktop/\",\n        ptbN => \"foo.png\"\n    ),\n\nSee: dsstore repo at hhhh.org and older repo at GitHub\n\nA: You can isolate things a little if you don't mind using terminal.\nThe trash in finder is an overlay of trash from each mounted volume and each user. Furthermore, you can see the filename of the file and search using spotlight to see if there are similar files or use spotlight to search in Time Machine to find where the file was before it was trashed.\nThe pragmatic way to solve this is to drag the file to your desktop and then open/inspect/file it accordingly. (Or to just let Finder put it back and then use spotlight to find it).\nTo use terminal:\nls -la ~/.Trash\nsudo ls -la /.Trashes\n\nIf you're not familiar with sudo and that it can delete anything with no recovery, I'd recommend not using sudo and asking follow on questions to learn more about terminal.\n", "Q: Using Turtle Beach XO Four Stealth Headset with Macbook Pro Retina 15\", Mid-2012 I've read a few older posts about headsets and the TRRS headphone/mic input here, here, here, here and the consensus seems to be that the Macbook is expecting \"line-level\" input (either that or you have the mysterious occasional answer of \"mine works!\").\nMy question is more clearly related to this answer: which is, if these Macbook Pros only accept a powered/line-level input, then how do they recognize the iPhone earbuds/microphone? I have not seen this addressed anywhere else.\nMy Turtle Beach XO Four Stealth is not powered, its only hookup is a TRRS jack. When I plug it in the Input doesn't switch from internal to external as it does for my Apple earbuds/mic.\nAny explanations for the difference in behavior? I assume this may just be dependent on the hardware of the headset, but what would this difference be.\n\n\nA: Apple use the CTIA standard TRRS while most other companies use the OMTP standard.\nThese 2 pictures should short it out. Notice the Ground and microphones are switched.\n\n\n*\n\n*OMTP\n\n*CTIA\nHope this answers your question.\n", "Q: Setting up signatures with different font in Mail.app I am trying to set up signature blocks to attach to emails sent using mac mail.  I want part of the signature block to be in script, but using the font option I cannot get it to a script.  \n\nA: The font option only lets you select your default font. To select any font, when in the Signature editor, press ⌘T to open the Fonts inspector and choose a font family and typeface.\n                           \n", "Q: Lost Wi-Fi passwords after reset network settings on iPhone After a network configuration reset on my iPhone all Wi-Fi passwords were lost. They were stored in iCloud Keychain, synced with my Mac, where they disappeared too. This is very frustrating since it seems that they were store only on iCloud and I can't restore them via old Time Machine backups.\n(In Keychain on my Mac I have only some of them, 90% are lost.)\n\nA: I came across this question and this was suggested by someone on a forum:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable iCloud Keychain from the iCloud settings page (On the top of settings if running iOS 10.3, down the list if running other versions of iOS)\n\n*Do the \"Reset network settings\" to debug the network issue you're experiencing\n\n*All the Wi-Fi passwords should now be deleted. What you now have to do is to connect to a network manually, then re enabling your iCloud Keychain, your old WiFi passwords should have resynced and you should now have access to all previously connected WiFis. \n\n\nNote that I haven't tested this personally, but I just came across this because I'm trying to debug a problem when my iPad disconnects from WiFi only when streaming Netflix.\n\nA: Are you using an Airport base? If so, you can force the password to be added back to your keychain from there (assuming it is in the airport base settings).\nGo to Airport Utility/Edit/Wireless\nin this tab the name of your WiFi should be mentioned, with the password typed but not visible. If not selected yet, then tick the box for \"Remember this password in may keychain\", then it should save an item in you keychain again and your mac reconnecting automatically to this WiFi \nGood luck\n", "Q: Finder stacked icons in icon view causes finder to crash I have 2,260 photos in my Dropbox Camera Uploads folder. Somehow they all got stacked on top of each other. When the camera upload is complete, it launches the camera uploads folder in finder in this stacked view. This pretty much instantly brings my computer to a halt and crashes finder. I have tried refreshing every plist and cache I could find to get finder to \"forget\" this stacked view to no avail.\n\nHow do I get finder to completely forget all of it's \"remembered\" view preferences?\n\nA: As tubedogg has mentioned, it is the .DS_Store which stores the information related how the Finder formats a particular folder's view.  By deleting the .DS_Store file using Terminal.app, you will reset the view options of that folder.\nHowever, if you are not comfortable using the terminal, you can go to Finder, and open a new window from the File menu: File > New Finder Window.\nNow, click on your home folder in the sidebar, and then set the window view to column mode by clicking the button shown in the following screenshot, or by going to the View menu and selecting As Columns.\n\nNavigate to your camera uploads folder, and select one of the images in the folder, just to make sure that the Camera Uploads folder is selected.  Next, from the View menu, change some view parameters, such as Arrange By, and then change the view to List (all this is just so that the .DS_Store file gets overwritten with new changes)\nNo guarantee that it will work, but it's worth a shot.\n\nHaving said all that, the simplest way to reset it is just to simply use the terminal command that tubedogg suggested. However: I would recommend against the -rf. There is no need for the force & recursive flags.  It just adds extra risk if something were to be mistyped. I'd suggest the following:\nrm \"/Users/$(whoami)/Dropbox/Camera Uploads/.DS_Store\"\n\n", "Q: Backing up Photos library to external hard drive Regarding Photos and its file structure, if I want to back up my photographs to an external hard drive, what files do I identify to be copied over? That is, if I back up the Photos Library, am I actually protecting the pictures themselves (or just links to them)?\n\nA: If you started a new library from scratch - read: did not convert from a previous iPhoto or Aperture library - then the Your Library Name.photoslibrary bundle contains everything.\nException: If you are using a referenced library (Photos menu > Preferences > General > Importing: \"Copy files\" box is not checked) then you need to back up the folder(s) where your actual photos are located as well.\nIf you did convert from a previous library, and have not removed it, you should back up both to be safe (though theoretically backing up just one should back up everything).\n", "Q: Can anyone share original IO80211FAMILY kext for OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 Can anyone share original IO80211FAMILY kext file for OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 as I by mistake deleted it and now my WiFi has stopped working.\nI could not find it on Google, please if you have the 10.8.5, please share original file.\n\nA: Run the 10.8.5 combo updater, from https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1676?locale=en_GB\nThis will ensure all updates since 10.8.0 are applied.\n", "Q: Any ideas why Mavericks is slowing down due to BetterSnapTool? I use BetterSnapTool to resize my windows with keyboard shortcuts. Since upgrading to Mavericks, after I've used my computer for 6-12ish hours, scrolling and moving things around the screen using the trackpad becomes sluggish and stutters. When I close BetterSnapTool, it fixes the issue, and it stays fixed until I relaunch.\nAny ideas what is causing the issue? Is there an easy, low overhead way to automatically quit and relaunch BetterSnapTool every 4 hours or so?\n\nA: (This answers the second question about how to automate restarting BetterSnapTool. Since I haven't experienced the issue described and have no second-hand explanations, I can't answer the question of why this is happening.)\nHere is a quick and simple AppleScript I whipped up that works for restarting BetterSnapTools:\ntell application \"BetterSnapTool\"\nquit\nend tell\n\ndelay 2 -- Wait for BetterSnapTool to close\n\ntell application \"BetterSnapTool\" to activate\n\nIf you want to set this to automatically run every, say, 6 hours I think your best bet is to create a Launch Daemon using launchd. A quick presentation of this approach can be found here. For more information, check the entry on creating Launch Daemons in the apple developer's library.\nYou said \"low overhead\", which I took to mean using only methods native to OS X. If you're fine with third-party software, though, this GUI application for cron (the precursor to launchd) scheduling seems promising (but I haven't tried it so can't be certain).\n", "Q: iPhone 6+ Deleting Photos does not release memory I tried settings-safari-advanced-website data - delete. It released most of my memory but no all. I still have a couple of LOCAL DISK files that cannot be deleted and take up several GB\n\nA: iOS 8 and newer has a feature called Recently Deleted in Photos. \nTry opening photos then tapping on albums. Now tap recently deleted then press select in the top right corner and press delete all. \nThis should release all of the old photos. As regards to deleting all of the misc. data, you should be able to download an app on your computer like iFunbox or iExplorer to use (part) of the iOS filesystem. \nWith this being said, you should be able to open the Application Archives folder and delete all of the zip files found there. \n", "Q: Can't select Photos library. Click Choose Library, nothing happens I have 3 iPhoto Libraries. Have already converted 2 of them. Went back to open the first converted and it would not open. Nothing. \nI can select the other two, but when I try and select the 3rd, nothing happens. I click, the button registers the click, but nothing happens. \nHere is a screenshot - I click Choose Library and nothing happens. \n\nI can select the other libraries, no problem. \n\nA: That Library is showing as a .migratedlibrary file, which means it's already been 'translated' to Photos format & can no longer be opened in Photos.\nThe contents must be in one of your other libraries in the list, or if on a remote disk, you may have to open it fro the `Other Library…' button.\nBy default, the new Photos Library will be in the same location as the old iPhoto Library it was imported from.\nFrom How Photos for Mac handles iPhoto imports\n\nSo, when Photos migrates an iPhoto library, it changes the file extension on the iPhoto library package to .migratedphotolibrary and makes a hard link to all iPhoto media assets in its own library package, using the same directory structure as iPhoto.\n\n\nA: For some reason, renaming the iPhoto Library and then relaunching Photos worked. It loaded just fine. \n\nA: I found that trying to open the .photolibrary bundle manually in Finder worked just fine when only the .migratedphotolibrary bundle showed up in the choose library pane.\n", "Q: How do I disable WebEx Assistant on startup for Mac? How do I disable WebEx Assistant on startup for Mac?   I dont want to remove the application completely, but I dont want it to launch automatically at startup.\n\nA: Try System Prefs > User & Groups > Your name > Login Items.\nSelect it in the list & click the - button underneath\nIf it's not listed there, then check either /Library/LaunchDaemons/ or /Library/StartupItems/ to see whether it has an entry in there.\nIt's safe to remove items from there - though they will continue running until the next reboot.  \nIf you want to be able to restore functionality in future, zip the file in situ then trash the original.\n\nA: I tried removing this from the user's Login Items, but it re-appeared each time I started the app.  I could not find it in any of system or user launch or startup .plist files.\nThen I noticed that the \"Preferences\" menu, where this sort of thing would normally be configured was grayed out.  So I went looking for Webex plist file itself.\nTurns out if you look at ~/Library/Preferences/com.cisco.webexmeetingsapp.plist you'll find a key called PTLaunchAtLogin.\nI used a text editor and changed it to \"false\". If the file is not readily editable directly and Xcode it's installed on your Mac, simply double click the .plist file and toggle the key to \"false\".\nProblem solved.\n<key>PTLaunchAtLogin</key>\n<false/>\n\n\nA: There are multiple locations where an application can place configuration to achieve autostart or \"automatically restart\" if stopped. Some don't autostart but setup a scheduled daily start.\nI'm using a (commercial) tool to detect those and disable such behaviour: Lingon X. It's basically a GUI for launchd. I especially like the feature that it alerts me if something is added or modified.\n\nA: DaveANP has this pegged.  I had already tried the accepted answer of removing from login items, but it kept reappearing there.  Yet another reason to use another platform for meetings.\n~/Library/Preferences/com.cisco.webexmeetingsapp.plist was not readily editable directly, but opening in Xcode made it trivial to set this boolean to FALSE.\n", "Q: Need help disabling imessage?

The crash report is attached below.  I did some research on kernel panics, and I figured the VirtualBox kernel extensions would be the obvious suspects. I find it odd, though, given that I wasn't running the VirtualBox app itself. To be sure, I just upgraded VirtualBox.\nAt any rate, let me explain in a little bit more detail the circumstances of the panic. I had had a Wolfram Mathematica notebook open for quite some time. The crash itself happened while I was browsing a PDF document in Google Chrome. After the panic, OS X automatically restarted and it could restore all windows and apps that were open before the panic, but something weird was happening: both Finder was unresponsive and I didn't have Wi-Fi connection. I also noticed that Mathematica had 7 or 8 grayed-out, unresponsive windows open with the “hourglass” icon superimposed on each of them (not the beach ball, but the icon you usually see under the Apple logo upon startup), instead of the 2 and 3 windows Mathematica had open before the crash (notebook, message panel, and a toolbar). Once I force quit Mathematica, Finder immediately became responsive again and the Wi-Fi connection resumed.\nBased on this weird experience, I have three admittedly non-expert hypotheses about what caused the panic:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mathematica exhibited some idiosyncratic, one-time behavior that somehow caused a systemic failure. Perhaps some pathological interaction with the VirtualBox extensions?\n\n*RAM problems: five months ago, I upgraded the manufacturer-provided 2x2 GB RAM slots to 2x4 GB RAM slots I bought on Amazon (the model had very good reviews) after double-checking it would work with my MBP. Up until today the new RAM seemed to be working properly.\n\n*Other hardware problems: my MBP is not young (it's an early 2011 model that I bought more than 3.5 years ago), and there may be some mysterious HDD or other hardware failure that began to take its toll.\nGiven that I had never had kernel panics before and the horror stories I read about their frequent recurrences once they start, it would be very helpful for me to know what was the likely explanation for this panic and what steps I can make to prevent future occurrences. Do you think the description above points to a more definitive cause?\n\n[crash report attached below this line]\n\nAnonymous UUID:       4CABCC7C-02A7-A534-BE98-7EEC1989E170\n\n\nMon May  4 04:29:47

I am migrating from Aperture to the new Photos. In Aperture, I had my originals on an external hard drive (i.e. the library was local, but the originals were on the external drive). Now in iPhoto, I can still access those externally saved photos, but they don't upload to iCloud (instead, it always asks me for permissions whenever I open any external image, which is also annoying).\nI found out that I can select an album and go on File->Consolidate to have it copy the originals over into the Photos library. When I do this, the images are being uploaded to iCloud. So far so good.\nBut this is when I run into space issues: I want all the originals to live in the cloud and have a thin library on my Mac. With storing the originals on the external hard drive, this was working (still ~50 GB on my Mac). But now it seems to store all the originals on my Mac anyway. I have selected Preferences->Optimize Mac Storage, yet it claims there is not enough storage on my mac to keep all the optimized version:\n\nYour Mac Storage is full\nThis Mac is no longer updating because there is not enough\nspace to store optimized versions of your photos and videos.\n\n\nWhen I right-click an album, I can select \"Download Originals to this Mac\" - what I want to do is the opposite: delete the originals locally, keep only low-res versions and have the originals in full resolution available in iCloud. How can I achieve that?\n\nA: Can you confirm that all of your photos and videos have uploaded to the cloud? Check https://www.icloud.com/#photos\nBecause it sounds like the error might be that they're only uploading if they first are copied from your external drive to the internal drive.\nAssuming they have all uploaded, you can (after making a backup), simply delete your local Pictures > Photos Library.photoslibrary. Photos.app will create a new such file when you start it again, and only low-res versions of your images will be downloaded.\nIf you have not succeeded in uploading all of your photos yet, your best bet is probably to switch Photos Library.photoslibrary to be on your external drive, to avoid filling up your internal drive.\n", "Q: How Do I Put An App I Wrote On My iPad? I am somewhat new the world of Mac and \"i\" devices. I have an iMac 9 and I am thinking about buying an iPad mini but have read statements on the web that if I write my own app I will go through the App Store to get onto my own iPad and pay a $100 annual fee. How mush truth is there to this? This is very extreme for someone that wants to write apps for my own use. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You would have to pay around 100$ (annual) for iOS Developer Program in order to upload Your app to the device. You won't have to upload it via AppStore but directly from Xcode. \nYou need to pay, because Apple provides You all neccessary Provisioning Profiles, Certificates etc. You'll be able to add up to 100 iDevices to Your account.\nHere's knowledge base with all informations.\n\nA: If you're not on the latest version of iOS you could also jailbreak your device to be able to deploy iOS apps. This is an easy tutorial explaining the process\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Jailbroken device install AppSync Unified 5.2-1 (or later) from AngelXWind’s repo. Don’t use any other AppSync, and if you have others, be sure to remove them.\n\n*Open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS.sdk/SDKSettings.plist and change AD_HOC_CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED to YES. You may need to duplicate it to the desktop, change it, save it, then drag and drop back into the original folder because OS X let you edit the file in place.\n\n*If XCode was running, restart XCode.\n\n*Change your Project and Target settings to “Ad Hoc Code Sign” in Build Settings\n\n*Tell XCode to run app on iPhone. At this point XCode will put app on your iDevice, but can’t debug because it can’t attach to the process. The app will start then close immediately. You can now manually start the app on the phone now though.\n\n*To enable debugging: In your project select File>New File Property List and create a file called Entitlements.plist. Add Can be debugged`` orget-task-allow` (both do the same thing) and set the value to YES.\n\n*Now change your Project and Target Code Signing Entitlements (In Build Settings) to Entitlements.plist (you have to type it in).\n\n", "Q: MBP hanging on unlock after sleep in Yosemite My mid-2012 MacBook Pro is worse at waking up from sleep than I am.

I can still hit \"cancel\" and go back to the Enter Password screen, and the \"go back to sleep\" function works fine. But attempting another login just results in another hang\nThis usually happens only after an extended period of sleeping - almost every time it goes overnight, but not when I step away for an hour or so.\nIt seems to have begun recently when I upgraded to Yosemite.\n\nA: I set a 24-hour delay before the SSD goes into standby mode:\nsudo pmset -a standbydelay 86400\n\nand my MBP now unlocks just fine after waking up.\n", "Q: How do I make the Console app reappear after deleting Everything? OS X Yosemite I deleted every file that was contained in the console's logs listing of my Macbook Pro 15, including the \"All messages,\".\n Now when I click to open the app, the program opens but no GUI will load. The only way I can get the GUI to load is to manually open a log file, and the tab under \"System Log Queries\" is empty.\nAny clue how I can fix this to where the console GUI will load when I open the app?

Is it safe to delete my Time Machine sparse bundle file? Can a fresh time machine backup be recreated WITHOUT reformatting the drive or affecting any other files on my external Time Machine drive?\nMy time machine backups stopped a month ago and nothing I do will get the backups to continue as usual.  The drive is 25% full.  I don't know what to do.  The way I look at it, the best option might be to delete the sparse bundle entirely and just start a fresh sparse bundle, right?   This seems logical to me but I cannot find any advice anywhere to affirm my belief.\nI am afraid to choose the \"Delete backup disk\" option in the Time Machine applet because, while I want it to delete my sparse bundle, I am afraid it will take the liberties of deleting all content on the \"drive\".   That would be disastrous since I also use the drive for a important file share.   I'm also afraid to delete the sparse bundle because I don't know exactly how it works.\nCan anyone provide advice?  I cannot find any advice on this specific subject anwhere.\n\nA: As long as you don't care about anything in the backup being gone, yes it is safe to remove the sparsebundle.\nDisable Time Machine first. Instead of deleting the whole bundle at once:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click and choose Show Package Contents.\n\n*Open the bands folder.\n\n*Select a large number of bands (8000 at a time seems to be good from what I read) and move those to the trash.\n\n*Repeat until all bands have been deleted, then delete the main sparsebundle file.\n\n\nA: Sparsebundles are created for each machine backed up to Time Machine. I needed to delete one of these sparsebundle files. Manually deleting thousands of files under the 'Bands' folder takes a long time. The faster and easiest method is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Switch to 'Superuser': sudo su (you will be asked for your admin user pw)\n\n*Change directory to your Time Machine/Sparsebundle path: cd /filepath to Time Machine\n\n*List files to be sure you see the Sparsebundle you wish to remove: ls\n\n*Remove the sparsebundle: rm -R \"sparsebundle_filename.sparsebundle\"\n\n*Exit Superuser: exit\n\n*Close Terminal\n\n\nNote that while logged in as Superuser you can do anything to your Mac so be certain you know what you're doing while logged in as 'su'. Also, I put my filename in quotes as it contained spaces, you do not need to enclose in quotes if your filename does not contain any spaces.\nIt takes a minute or two to remove the offending file, depending on file size. Be patient...You're done!\n\nA: I followed the links suggested by njboot and the solution to my problem was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off time machine backups. \n\n*Delete time machine system prefs file\n\n*Reboot machine and if the file is still there, delete the prefs file\nagain and reboot again. \n\n*once the Prefs file is gone, if you go into Time machine prefs, the disk is no longer selected. \n\n*Then, finally select the disk that you had been connected to before and then the backup should connect successfully again. \n\n*At that point it was working for me again.\n\n\nA: The way that worked best for me was to shut down the mac and start a linux computer.  If you do the same thing in Ubuntu there are two benefits compared to mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can feel relaxed and not have to worry about Time Machine starting automatically which will lock up the process and force you to start over.\n\n*Finder never showed a progress bar, even when I tried with a small amount of files.  Nautilus (the Ubuntu equivalent), on the other hand, has a nice little wheel that shows the overall status when you delete files and folders.\nEverything went smoothly in Ubuntu and even command-line was easy to work with despite the thousands of files in the \"bands\" folder.\n\nA: Easy access to 'Bands' in a .sparsebundle file in Air Capsule and deleting them (individually) via iPhone:\nhttps://www.stratospherix.com/support/getting-started-with-timecapsule.php\n", "Q: Why do my Macbook Pro's WiFi speeds drop significantly when paired with Bluetooth devices? NOTE: This question is NOT a duplicate of Bluetooth and Wifi interfering with one another since Yosemite. That answer pertains to 1) The 2.4 GHz band only and 2) Yosemite only.\nBackground:\nThough currently I’m running Yosemite (10.10.3), I have consistently experienced this issue since purchasing my Macbook Pro (Late 2013, originally running Mavericks). Whether it be a bluetooth mouse, headphones, or even iPhone, whenever I pair a device with my Macbook Pro, my Wifi speeds (running on 5 GHz band) drop by at least %50. I can reproduce this issue repeatedly. It only occurs when a device is paired via bluetooth to the machine. It does not occur when bluetooth is simply enabled on my computer. \nAt this point, I just don't connect devices via bluetooth anymore since the WiFi drop is noticeable. I am using a Logitech nano receiver mouse (and using up one of my precious two :( USB ports in the process) rather than using a Bluetooth mouse.\nMachine Specs:\nModel Name: MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)\nModel Identifier:   MacBookPro 11,3\nProcessor: 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7\nMemory: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\nSystem Version: OS X 10.10.3 (14D136)\nKernel Version: Darwin 14.3.0\n\nSpeed Tests1:\nWiFi speeds with Bluetooth-enabled, no devices paired:\n\nWiFi speeds with Bluetooth-enabled, any device paired:\n\n\nTroubleshooting:\nI’ve ruled out my LAN set-up:\n\n\n*\n\n*I use a TP-LINK Archer C8 Router connected to a modem provided by my ISP (running in bridge mode). I use the 5 GHz band exclusively. To rule out any band interference, I’ve tested the WiFi speed on the 2.4 GHz band as well. The same drop occurs regardless of the band. \n\n*I’ve used my ISP’s modem as a Gateway to directly connect to the internet (to rule out the TC-Link Router as the cause). Same result. \nI’ve isolated the issue to that of a Wireless one.\nThere is no speed drop when my machine uses a wired connection (Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter > Ethernet Cable > WAN)\nI’ve ruled out a specific Bluetooth device as the cause:\nOriginally, I thought the issue was with my Logitech M557 mouse. I tested my Magic Mouse instead. Both yielded the same drop in Wifi speed. The same has gone for any device that I paired with my MBP - Apple brand or not. Sidenote: I’ve unpaired the devices after testing. I only have one device paired (though not actively connected). \nI’ve ruled out third party software:\nThe issue persists without any third party kernel extensions loaded. Additionally, with no other third party software running (Dropbox, for example).  \nI’ve ruled out a specific OS X:\nThis issue has occurred since purchase, in Dec 2013. Across OS X Mavericks - Yosemite. Additionally, the machine has had a clean install of OS X from a fresh Yosemite image. \nI’ve ruled out my Macbook Pro’s hardware:\nI ran the Apple Diagnostic Test, repeated times, with no error codes. On a separate issue (blown out builtin speaker recently), I had brought my machine into Apple. I had them run their in-house diagnostic test to confirm no BT related hardware issues. Additionally, as stated, this issue has been a problem from Day 1. \n\nMy Question:\nWhy does my Macbook Pro's WiFi speed drop by 50+% when paired with any Bluetooth device? Is there a solution?\n\n1Courtesy of speedof.me\n\nUPDATE:\nScreenshot of detailed Wifi connection with a BT mouse paired. The SNR and Tx Rate are good:\n\nIn fact, nearly identical without BT device paired:\n\n\nA: I found this answer here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6803542, a guy named 'Todd Berliner' had similar issues. Credits for him if this fixes your issue\nTodd has similar problems and worked with an Apple senior supervisor for several weeks and came to the following fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off bluetooth.\n\n*Disconnect all peripherals from your computer.\n\n*Open System Preferences. In the \"Energy Saver\" preference, de-select \"Wake for network access\" (no check, and leave it that way).\n\n*Open the finder. Select the \"Go\" menu.  Select \"computer.\" Select \"Macintosh HD.\"  Go the the \"Library\" folder.  Go to the \"Preferences\" folder. Find the preference file \"com.apple.bluetooth.plist.\"\n\n*Rename \"com.apple.bluetooth.plist\" as \"com.apple.bluetooth.plist.old\" (i.e. add \".old\").  Eventually, if this solution works for you, you can delete this \"old\" preference file.\n\n*Restart your computer (this will create a new \"com.apple.bluetooth.plist\" preference file).\n\n*Turn bluetooth back on.\n\n\nApparently, the problem is a bug caused by a bad interaction between the bluetooth preference file and wifi.\n\nA: You have explicitly written that you tested both 2.4GHz en 5GHz, nevertheless I am still giving this as an anser.\nIn short:\nIn your new software setup, I think your bluetooth uses the same frequency as your WiFi, they are proberbly both on 2.4GHz. Change your WiFi to fixed 5GHz if possible or choose try 2.4GHz channels (some users see big differences on different channels).\nLonger version:\nInterference of the 2.4 GHz and 5GHz band\nIn analog and digital communications, signal-to-noise ratio is a measure of signal strength relative to background noise. You want a high signal to noise ratio. Example:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your signal is weak, lets say 50, but the noise is low, lets say 10, then there is still 40 left for data transfer.\n\n*If your signal is strong, lets say 80, but the noise is high as well, lets say 50, there is only 30 left for data transfer.\n\n\nSimpel said: Noise is usually radio signal in the same frequency range.\nKnowing this, there is a good article on the Apple website that explains what is happening. It also has some links to other good documentation, like the Wireless Diagnostics support page. I summarised the most important parts.\nEffects of interference:\n\n\n*\n\n*A decrease in the wireless range between devices\n\n*A decrease in data throughput over Wi-Fi\n\n*Intermittent or complete loss of the wireless connection\n\n*Difficulty pairing during a Bluetooth device's discovery phase\n\n\nSources of interference\n\n\n*\n\n*Microwave ovens\n\n*Direct Satellite Service (DSS)\n\n*Certain external electrical sources (railroad tracks, power stations)\n\n*Other transmitters/receivers that operate in the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bandwidth. (like other WiFi or Bluetooth transmitters)\n\n*Certain displays may emit harmonic interference\n\n\nPossible fix\nTry changing your access point to use 5 Ghz or a lower 2.4 GHz channel.\nWhen you use a Macintosh with an AirPort or TimeCapsule basestation, by default, this should go automatically as the two machines try to get the highest signal to noise as possible and switch frequencies automatically.\n\nA: I have the same problem with my MacBook Pro Retina 13\" 2014 on Yosemite 10.10.3 and 10.10.4 with Apple AirPort. My problem is not depended on bluetooth state at all. Wife's MacBook Air have no problems at all, looks like it does not support 802.11ac at all - only 802.11n. So I think the problem is in 802.11ac.\nJust found how to fix it – this is not good fix, but it works.\nI have changed AirPort 5GHz network name and connected not to 5GHz network.

It has a Mac version as well, and I've not seen a more powerful timer app.\n\nA: Your reminders to Go the the Gym, Pay Rent, Go Swimming, Take Pills and Have Meals can all be done easily using the Calendar while creating a daily or monthly reminder. \nYou can set an alert to take a break but you need to set the exact time and then when the break should end, e.g. you can set a smoke break for 10am and that break will end at 10:18am; something like that and you can repeat the break every day. However, there isn't a way to repeat the break every 2 hours, etc. You will need to manually enter the start time of the break and then request a daily repeat of the same break using the same time. \nPersonally, I need a way to set an alert that begins when I start it and lasts for 5 minutes and then repeats every 5 minutes until I stop it manually, but I haven't found anything that can do this.\n", "Q: Mac mini wakes 2 seconds after going to sleep Sometimes (randomly as far as I can tell), my Mac mini refuses to go to sleep.

So I've discovered Apple's mystical implementation of hard linking with the new Photos app library and the old iPhoto library. Although Finder reports that both take up a significant and similar number of GBs on the disk space, they apparently are pointing to the same data on my disk, so data hasn't been duplicated.\nQuestion is, how can I verify this? If I check the size of the parent folder, it's also reporting double GB. I imagine I can check all the folders at the root level and find that the total adds up to more than what I have based on free space... but that doesn't actually pinpoint what files are hard linking.\n\nA: Hard linked files share the same inode (which kind of identifies the file in the filesystem). So what you can do is to get the path of two photos which should be the same (\"Reveal in Finder\" in the old application, probably something similar in the new), open Terminal and run\nls -li /path/from/old/app.jpg /path/from/new/app.jpg\n\nto see whether the number is really the same.\n\nA: You can check for hard links by selecting either the folder [possibly a bit excessive] or one sample file…\nYou can access the contents of a Library file [which is really a folder] by right clicking it & selecting 'Show Package Contents'.\nBe careful not to actually play around in there, Apple would rather you didn't ;-) but looking through the folder hierarchy won't in itself break anything. Masters would be the ideal folder to check in.\nLaunch Terminal & type ls -l then drop your sample file onto the window - that will insert the correct path.\nAny file that reports a 2 (or more) in the value after the permissions -rw-rw-rw-@ section is hard linked with 2 references.\nAn example - \n\n", "Q: Need Help With iPhone 4 I have an iPhone 4 that I shut off with the touch assist because my lock button is broken.

Also check the configuration of any Apple Routers and Apple Express units you may have for IPV6 configurations and change them to Link Local. I did this and my wifi is back to normal. \n\nA: This could be something as simple as your wifi router being that bit to far away, or being blocked by something such as too many walls or interfering devices for the startup problem.\nFor the wifi dropping problem, MacBooks now drop wifi while asleep and on battery power to conserve it. There doesn't appear to be a way to turn this off, I myself just put the device on screensaver and leave something such as a USB mouse to prevent it closing all the way if I need to keep the wifi. If it isn't happening when you're MacBook is sleeping then I can't help you there.\n\nA: Not knowing the numerous walkthroughs you executed, there are a few things you can try (which you may have done already.)\nThe easiest is to remove all the Preferred Networks from System Preferences > Network > Wifi > Advanced button.

I can see the background and the top row of information.  Nothing else is up there...no mouse, no folders, nothing along the bottom. What is the reason for this? It was just working fine a short time ago.\n\nA: It is most likely that your TV is showing a secondary screen view, where little other than the background shows by default.\nTry Settings>Displays>Arrangement, then check 'Mirror Displays'. This will duplicate what is on your laptop screen onto the computer. Uncheck it, and you now have two displays, with the relationship between them shown in the graphic within the 'Arrangement' tab.\nThe reason you see only the background, and 'top row' is that is how OSX displays the secondary display. The Dock is not visible, and there are no folders there...because you have not put any there. \nTry this: attach your TV, then drag a window onto the TV.

Apparently they limit it based on the MAC address of your network adapter. I tried to disable adapters and change MAC address, worked for Wifi and Ethernet but didn't work for Firewire device. I assume this is the reason why GPMM still can see the device and machine ID and gives me message saying \"Only two accounts can be used per computer\".\nI went through these resources already..\nhttps_____linuxundich_____de/gnu-linux/musik-per-google-music-manager-zu-mehr-als-nur-zwei-accounts-hochladen/\n(asked same question here:)\nhttps_____thomashunter_____name/blog/google-music-manager-only-two-accounts-can-be-used-per-computer/#comment-368381\nhttps____linuxundich_____de/gnu-linux/musik-per-google-music-manager-zu-mehr-als-nur-zwei-accounts-hochladen/\nHere is what I have done...\nI am on OSX. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get it working. I am on iMac, disabled all adapters (Network prefpane in System Preferences), including Network adapter, Bluetooth adapter, Firewire, only Wifi active. Changed the Wifi MAC using WifiSpoof app and made sure the new MAC is changed (checked in Terminal) starting with a number 12 (e.g. MAC address changed is 12.a1.. etc), disabled network adapter for all virtual machines created in Virtual Box. \nI also deleted the settings configuration file for GPMM app and still getting this error.\nI also disabled bluetooth completely to check if any difference, but that wouldn’t affect it because Bluetooth is virtual interface so it’s enough to disable from the Network prefpane and it gets disabled.. see the log below.\nTo change the Ethernet wired adapter MAC I used sudo ifconfig en1 ether 12:xx:xx…. Same doesn’t work however for the Firewire adapter, so I can’t spoof that Mac address. Confirmed through ifconfig en1 | grep ether and ifconfig en0 | grep ether, both wired and wireless adapters are now spoofed. But the Firewire adapter still has the real MAC address.\nI tried reboot the machine and again reassign the spoofed MAC addressed to see if there is any difference to check if the network devices are still listed with MAC address after I disabled them as network adapters in the Network prefpane.\nIssue continues.\nI see is that even after I disabled the network devices in Network prefpane, I still see them when I type \"networksetup -listallhardwareports\" in Terminal.... \nHardware Port: Bluetooth DUN\nDevice: Bluetooth-Modem\nEthernet Address: N/A\nHardware Port: Ethernet\nDevice: en0\nEthernet Address: XX:XX:XX.....

MAC address present\nHardware Port: Bluetooth PAN\nDevice: en2\nEthernet Address: N/A\nI can’t find way to disable to Ethernet and FireWire devices. Even with “ifconfig en0 down” I can’t get the network card to disconnect the MAC address.\nSome non-native devices on the network don’t get listed at all, but I don’t think Google counts these towards the hardware imprint in the GPMM counter e.g. routers, switches, it’s just the native built in devices. For that reason I can’t simply use an iPhone to thether to be able to connect additional accounts. So it must have to do with the native hardware which is still showing up.\nThe only last thing I can see is need to hide ethernet and firewire adapter completely so it doesn’t show the MAC address (or change the Firewire address) but I am not able to hide this hardware or change Firewire MAC address.\nI suspect this could be reason why GPMM is still seeing them so marking it as same device. \nQuestion:\nSo I assume I need to find way to disable these devices (Firewire and wired ethernet). Any ideas? Am I on the right track... I am running out of options here.\n\nA: Spoofing MAC address is not straightforward if you do it all by yourself but there is one great package to do jus that. If you don't already have npm installed do so by following the link. Then install spoof package. By doing npm install spoof --global. Then it's very easy to change you MAC address, do spoof --help for instructions.\n", "Q: Can't connect to mobile internet on iPhone 4s The other day I noticed my mobile Internet was not working on my iPhone 4s.

I am running Parallels 9 with Windows 7 on a 2011 27\" iMac with 20gb of ram, i5 3.1 processor, etc.  On the windows side, I have both a Home (//psf, though sometimes loads as Y:/ after a while) and Host(Z:/).  What is the difference?  Am I supposed to be able to access files the same way through both? I guess they point to different levels of my Mac Drive - the Host the whole drive, the home just my user folder. But why? Why are they both their? What is their purpose? \nNote:  I am currently having trouble saving ArcMap outputs to a file geodatabase which I had created from Windows on the Home drive (//psf - Y:/) and am wondering if this trouble could be related to differences in accessing or creating files between these two drives on the virtual machine.  SO, these problems prompted this question.\n\nA: Though your Parallels tech support service has expired, they do have Parallels Desktop for Mac forums, where you can ask for help, and find previous answers.\nIn particular, I found a relevant answer for you by eiraf-kr in the Parallels Forums.\n\nA user's \"Home\" folder is a common feature of Unix-y OSes, such as Unix, BSD, Linux, and OSX (since it's built up from a BSD core). You won't find any \"Home\" folder in Windows -- the closest you get is C:\\Documents and Settings[username]\\ instead.\nWhen you share your \"Home\" folder from your host Mac to the guest Windows machine, I think there's an option to have Parallels map the shared folders to Windows drives. (I say \"I think\" because I'm not in front of my Mac at the moment.) They'll then show up as extra drives in Windows Explorer, such as K: or R:.\nIf you don't opt to have Parallels map your shared folders, I believe they'll appear under Network Places in the locations pane on the left of an Explorer window (this is for XP; I assume Win7 has something similar). Alternately, you can type \\psf\\Home into the Explorer URL bar. You can then opt to manually map such network paths to Windows drives for easier access.

What other short cuts are there, like for instance, 'Alt F4' or 'Alt tab' but with a Microsoft keyboard.\n\nA: On a Mac, the equivalent to Task Manager is the Activity Monitor.\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Dock, click the Launchpad icon, then search for and click Activity Monitor.\n\n\nAlternatively, assuming that the Windows key behaves like the [Cmd] key, you can use [Cmd+Space], then type Activity Monitor.\nHowever, for applications that need to be force closed, right-click that application in the Dock, press [Alt] and choose Force Quit.\n\nA: The shortcuts are different for the OSs. You'll have to learn them, individually. Only third-party apps, and basic shortcuts like cut, copy, paste are similar. If you have a Win keyboard then the Win key is equal to Cmd (⌘) key, and rest are the same. Generally Win key is replaced with Cmd key in shortcuts. \nThe task manager is called Activity Monitor in Mac; find using Spotlight or in /Applications/Utilities/ folder, but if you just wanna quit an app do Cmd + Alt + Esc (this can also be accessed through Apple () menu at the top).\nI believe that Alt (⎇) + F4 quit an app on Win, so it's equivalent would be Cmd + Q. The Alt + Tab shortcut is the same as Cmd + Tab, or Cmd + Shft +Tab. Functions keys are rarely used and they have their pre-defined actions which you can see on a Mac keyboard. You can configure them to use as Standard functions key in the Keyboard Preference Pane.\nYou can see all the app shortcuts in the menus in the menu bar. The System shortcuts can be seem at System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts. You can also change them to what you like. If you find yourself using shortcuts but cannot remember them all I would recommend KeyCue, it shows all the possible shortcuts by pressing one.\n\nA: In addition to the \"activity monitor\", there's another option that comes handy to close running apps --> \"Force Quit Applications\";\n\"Force Quit Applications\" is launched by pressing Cmd (⌘) + Option (⌥) + Escape keys;\nA List of running apps appear, where by you can select the necessary application from the list and force quit using the \"Force Quit\" button.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201276\n\nA: Just press Alt + (Windows Logo Key) + Esc.\n", "Q: Alarm on iPhone through Apple Watch When I set an alarm on my Apple Watch, is it possible to copy this automatically to my iPhone so that both devices alert me?\n\nA: Not using the built-in apps.

And then type the command curl -OC - http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1503-01.iso to download the CentOS ISO image (I just picked this URL for an example, use you own as you wish).\nIf the download gets part of the way and stalls or dies, you can just run the same command again and it should restart from the place it left off.\nThe O in the command tells curl to use the remote filename and the C - tells it to continue where it stopped previously.\nPlease note: servers have to be set up to allow downloads to start from random positions, so if you try this and it always starts from the very beginning it could be that the server doesn't support it.\n\nA: Try using Google Crome or Mozilla Firefox as it may fix the problem, because my Mac's Safari doesn't work very well for downloads but Chrome downloads well.\n", "Q: Quicktime record screen without the overlay I'd like to record part of my screen, but the QuickTime screen recorder dims the rest of the screen while it records (the gray in the screenshot below). \nHow can I turn this dimming off so I can use the rest of my computer normally while recording.\n\n\nA: start recording. hold option key and press quicktime icon at dock. dimming disappears.\n\nA: The screen dimming can't be disabled, but what you could do is record the whole screen and then import the finished recording into iMovie and crop it (instructions) to only contain what you want it to.\nInstructions, in case of link rot:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the timeline, select the clip or photo you want to crop.\n\n*To show the cropping controls, click the Cropping button.\n\n*Click the Crop to Fill button.\nAn adjustable frame appears on top of the clip in the viewer.\nNote: This frame is constrained to a 16:9 aspect ratio.\n\n*Move and resize the frame until you’re satisfied with the result.\n\n*To apply the crop, click the Apply button in the cropping controls.\n\nA: OK. I got a solution here by using mutiple desktops in mission control on Mac.\nQuicktime will only dim one desktop at a time. Just create a spared desktop dedicated to Quicktime, and keep your work in a sperate desktop.\nHere is my set up: I have two monitors, one for work(Monitor 1), one for screen recording(Monitor 2).\nOn monitor 1(working monitor):\n1.use \"Control + Up\" key to bring up this multiple desktops interface:\n\n\n\n*Create a new \"desktop\" by click on the plus icon(screen top right)\n\n*Launch your QuickTime only on this new desktop. and Start screen recording on your 2nd monitor.\n\n*Back to Monitor 1, use \"Control+ Left \" to go back to your working desktop. It won't get dimmed.\n\nA: You can use the dimmed area as normal, the dimming is to show what is being recorded.  I did look in the preferences files of Quicktime and there is no listed toggle to disable that.\nOne thing that will be different is screenshots include the dimming as it is a overlay that is almost top layer but below the screenshot layer.\n\nA: This is not possible with QuickTime. There is a reason it is called Screen recorder. \nIt will record whatever screen is on top (even if you switch it) it will now keep recording the new window.\nYou can not fix it to a specific window and move on letting it record that same window.\n\nA: I found a simple solution to prevent QuickTime ScreenRecorder from dimming your desktop (e.g. when in fullscreen Keynote Presentation mode).  After you start your screenrecording, and go into fullscreen mode with Keynote, hit the lock button on your touchbar to put your monitor to sleep.  Then wake up your computer and the screen will no longer be dim.  You'll have to edit out that first 5-10 secs from the screenrecording, but this was easier for me than the solutions proposed above.\n", "Q: What sets my Java Virtual Machine? I'm not understanding how my Java environment is getting set up.

So.. how to do this basic operation?\n\nA: The general answer is \n\n\"just be sure to paste into an unoccupied area of the Keynote slide\"\n\nMy issue was that I was trying to paste into an area already occupied by a textbox.  It may not be obvious due to a bunch of blank lines that make the box extend longer than immediately apparent.\n\nA: Be sure you are on the slide by clicking into it. The universal keyboard Command + V should pass your image. If that doesn't work then be sure you actually have something copied to the clipboard. \nAlternatively you can easily drag and drop an image onto a slide. \n", "Q: Is there a way to get a public URL for individual iCloud photos? I understand it's possible, through the Photos app and iCloud, to create a sharing stream of photos. What I am wondering is if it's possible to get a public URL from any given photo in iCloud.\nMy end goal is to use the URL in a shell script that would replicate CloudApp or Dropbox screenshot sharing, only using iCloud storage. Can't seem to find anything on the web that explains if this is/isn't possible.\nAny suggestions are greatly appreciated :)\n\nA: There is no way to get the URL from the Photos app that I am aware of. However, you can create a public album (see screenshot) which will then give you an album URL. You could scrape that page for image URLs. Psuedo Xpath to do so: //div[@class=\"view image-view canvas-image-view\"]\n(Note that the page is written in such a way that only the photo[s] visible on-screen are present in the HTML code, so your script would need to scroll through the window to scrape all the necessary URLs.)\n\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite Server won't create websites I'm having trouble creating a website in OS X Server (10.10.3) using the Website tab.

The dialog box stays open, and nothing happens. I've tried both with a certificate (port 443) and without (port 80), to no avail. All other settings are default.\n\nA: Well, now I feel a bit silly. I was remotely administering the server using server.app on another computer within the local network. Everything worked straight away as soon as I tried the same process on the server itself using Screen Sharing.\nI'm not sure why this is a problem, but it looks like remote administration using the Server.app doesn't work for everything!\n", "Q: How to fix the static screen on external monitor? I have a macbook air and this is what essentially happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*I connect external monitor using thunderbolt to DVI converter\n\n*The monitor works correctly\n\n*I lock screen, monitor goes blank\n\n*When I log back in the external monitor starts showing static for about 30 seconds and fixes itself after 30 seconds. The monitor fixes itself even if I turn the monitor off and on again :D\n\n\nThe problem does not occur on either Ubuntu or on Windows if I connect my other laptop.\nThis has been the case ever since I got the mac and I am not sure if there is any fix for this. If anyone can help, please let me know.\n\nA: I have seen the static on the Apple Cinema LED Display connected to a Mac Mini Late '09 using mini-DVI to Mini DisplayPort Kanex converter.\nWhat helped me was the order in which I connected the devices after the problems occurred. Not sure what monitor and what converter you use and whether these steps would help; however, what I learned is that these converters are very (VERY!) sensitive devices.\nSHUTTING DOWN\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn Macbook Air off (NOT just sleep, better reset PRAM and NVRAM, make it forget the terrors about the converter)\n\n*Disconnect the converter from the Mac\n\n*Disconnect the monitor from the converter and wait like 10 seconds\n\n*Turn your monitor off (pull from the power outlet, let it forget about the converter completely as well)\n\n\nRECONNECTING\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the monitor back into the outlet\n\n*Connect the converter (my converter has the\nUSB female and male cable, which are extremely important to connect as\nwell, otherwise it acts weird)\n\n*If you DO have the USB, plug it in into the Mac first\n\n*Plugin the Mini DisplayPort into the Mac\n\n*Turn your Mac on\n\n\nThe reason for all this is to make your ports read and initialize the devices in the right order.\nAlso, keep in mind how to disconnect the devices correctly.\nDisconnect the converter from the Mac first (Mini DiplsayPort)\nThen wait a bit and pull USB if you have it.\nDo not disconnect the monitor from a converter leaving the converter in your Mac. For some reason it causes problems when I connect the monitor back. My Mac won't see that the monitor is plugged in. Think of it as a converter having the drivers and its own soft running on your mac, so when you disconnect the monitor from the converter, Mac might not fully recognize that the monitor isn't there since the converter won't pass the signal saying, \"Hey, the monitor is fully disconnected, stop all services.\" It will keep running the processes until you disconnect the converter from the Mac. So when you connect the monitor back, it might not react.\nI do not like converters. I always try to avoid them as much as I can. So with the new Macbook and USB-C thing, I don't know... Hope they will build them better and smarter.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to make truly single spaced bullet items in Keynote Although I have selected \n\nSpacing 1.0 - single\n\n\nin the Text Style, we can see that there is still large space between each bullet item.

The problem with this iPhone is that the volume is really quiet whenever i'm playing music or making a call and setting the caller on the speaker.\nThe volume is currently at it's max (by tapping the buttons on the side).\n\nNote: I haven't used the \"broken\" iPhone for this screenshot, this was just for showing what I did to increase the volume to the max.\nI have tried rebooting the device a couple of times already, this didn't work.\nWhat do (or can) I have to do to make the speaker play at a decent volume again? Do I have to replace it?\n\nA: For Music anyways, check your EQ in the Music tab of Settings. Some sound quieter then others and vice versa.\nFor Speaker Phone I'm not so sure, but as a universal problem it may be Volume Limit, also found in the Music tab of Settings.\n\nA: My partner's iPhone is extremely quiet and tinny sounding (mine is not).

So I've attempted to avoid that in this question by leaving my outline in place for you. Thank you in advance for your time. I will truly appreciate it. \nProblem Explanation:\nI'm trying to find out how to create a command key for an option that already exists on my mac. The menu under \"System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\" doesn't work because this command isn't one of it's options. The command I would like to create a shortcut to is \"Right click (on text) > Transformations > Make Lower/Upper Case.\" I seem to be using this all the time and there is apparently not a keyboard shortcut option built into the mac for this.\nExplicitly Stated Question:\nHow do I get the command which I currently access through \"Right click (on text) > Transformations > Make Lower/Upper Case\" to have it's own keyboard shortcut?\nOther information (about me to help your answer help me): I'm not experienced in programing whatsoever. I would like to be but my few attempts at it have been fails. So I would like to avoid Applescript as much as possible, If you have to suggest Applescript in order to answer my question please be as explanatory as possible. Meaning, help me learn how to create the code myself don't just tell me the code to put in, where to look up the commands, what my code should look like, etc. \n\nA: You were looking in the right direction… though you cannot actually do this easily for a right click item - so long as there is a menu item in the same app, it's simple.\nI've only quickly tested this on Safari & TextEdit - whichever app you use must already have those 2 command options somewhere in their menu structure.\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\nSelect All Applications, then click the + button.\nSo long as you add the full, correct menu title [& that item exists in the app you are going to be using], the shortcut you ask it to use in the 3rd line will always find it. You don't need to enter any kind of menu hierarchy at all.\n\n", "Q: How to restore a stolen iPhone 5 after being found? My iPhone 5 was stolen and I erased and removed it via iCloud.\nAfter three days I found it and want to active it again.\nWhat is the procedure for recovering the content and activating it again?\n\nA: If you backed up your iPhone using iTunes (stored on your computer) or iCloud (stored in iCloud), restore from backup.\nWhen your iPhone has sufficient charge to turn on, you probably see the \"Hello\" screen.  The following Apple Support article describes how to restore your iPhone from iTunes backup or iCloud backup:    https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204686\n", "Q: How To Display IP Address In Control Center? I'm looking for a tweak/trick/tip that will display my internal ip in the control center when I pull it up.\n\n\n*\n\n*what options are available?\n\n\n[options for jailbroken devices are fine too]\nedit: I know there's ShowIP for NotificationCenter, I'm basically looking for the same thing but for Control Center instead.\n\nA: Found the answer doing some of my own research:\nCCSystemStatus on BigBoss.\nCCSystemStatus Review:\n\n\nIn his review of CCLoader, our jailbreak guru Jeff mentioned the fact that developers would be able to tap into the tweak and create their own sections in Control Center. That is the basis behind CCSystemStatus, a new iOS extension by vsnraindev that displays your available storage, IP address, free RAM and other system information about your iOS device in Control Center…\nWith numerous jailbreak tweaks available for viewing system information on iPhone, it only seems fitting that there be one for Control Center too. CCSystemStatus is enabled by default after installation, and its position within Control Center is adjustable using CCLoader. The tweak adds two lines of information to Control Center, and the section can be tapped to display a second page of info.\nThe eight different items displayed are your wireless IP address, cellular IP address, free RAM, average system load, wireless network SSID, gateway MAC address, and free space on both the device and /var directory. The tweak is compatible with the iPhone only at this moment, and it is available now for free on Cydia in the BigBoss repository. There are no options to configure outside of those in CCLoader.\n\n\n", "Q: Can't update apps on iPhone 5S. Keeps prompting for password Not able to update apps.

Either there's a bug in your app's settings, which it pulls from their API's through their website, or perhaps they have iCloud settings stored.\nIn the first case you should contact Trello about it or try removing and then re-adding the buggy content through the web version. If the latter is the case, go to Settings, iCloud, Storage, Manage Storage and find Trello.

The monitors are in portrait mode with total screen resolution of 3240x1920. \nI would like to be able to make an application run in full screen across all three monitors using the full screen mode introduced in Yosemite. At present, I can scale a window to almost fit the full screen manually. Is it possible to make this happen with the green full screen button in the gui?\n\nA: Fullscreen only works on the desktop (space) the application is inside of at the moment.

On their new TestTube page, YouTube writes:\n\nAnd if playing 4K videos at 3840x2160 isn't enough to melt your\n  device, try doing it at 60 frames per second.\n\nIs the latest MacBook Pro 13 able to play such videos smoothly?\n\nA: I'm under the assumption that you may have stumbled across reports such as this one in a casual Google search. I quote:\n\nThe Air correctly identified the attached monitor at 4K resolution, switching the user interface into HiDPI mode.\nSubsequent refresh rate tests confirmed that it was running at 60Hz, and the publication said that interface components were \"more than smooth enough for desktop use.\" Problems cropped up when performing animation-intensive actions, like entering full-screen mode, with \"clearly visible\" frame lag, showing that the display pushes the Intel HD 6000 graphics chip near its limit.\n\nNotice that the first emboldened snippet says that you have to switch the user interface. This likely means usage of 3rd-pary software, such as SwitchResX, to enable changing system setting and entering this configuration. This is not recommended. Changing the resolution settings to something that cannot be enabled via System Settings can cause problems. Trying to push your hardware over the limits set by Apple can cause the system to overheat and consequently be damaged. Your MacBook is not ventilated very well and you have an integrated GPU which relies in part on the CPU. The additional overhead will cause complications.\n\nI've read that full 4k at 60 fps is supported over DisplayPort. –  Šime Vidas 3 hours ago\n\nRefresh rates in the article above confirmed 60Hz. Is it able to play videos at 60Hz? The answer is likely yes. It is officially supported? No, their support page shows a limit of 30Hz at the resolution you stated.\nAs per your quote, can DP support 4k @ 60Hz? Yes, the DisplayPort 1.3 standard supports it. Does Thunderbolt 2 support DisplayPort 1.3? No. Remember that through the Thunderbolt port there is backwards compatibility with a mini DisplayPort cable, but with Thunderbolt 2 there are still some limitations as it uses the DisplayPort 1.2(a) standard.\n\nTo summarize this:\n\nIs the latest MacBook Pro 13 able to play such videos smoothly?\n\nObjectively speaking, yes, it is able to.\nWill the system play it at 60Hz on a 4k 60Hz monitor? No, it will not. It does not natively support it.\nAlso see DisplayPort 1.3 and Thunderbolt 2 on Wikipedia for sources and more detailed info.\n\nA: In my experience: No, it is not capable of decoding YouTube 4K/60fps videos without dropping frames.\nThis is with a MacBook Pro (13\", Early 2015) connected to a Dell P2715Q (3840×2160 @ 60 Hz) via DisplayPort. I used YouTube's hidden \"Stats for nerds\" feature to confirm significant frame droppage.\n\nA: No. Retina display for a 13-inch is only 2560x1600. And even if you use the HDMI port, it will be at 30fps.\n\nA: No, for my machine MacBook Pro (13\", Early 2015) with Dell P2715Q (3840×2160 @ 60 Hz) can not play 4k Youtube smoothly.\nYes my Macbook pro 13\" Early-2015 can play 4k Youtube video smoothly on Dell P2715Q but must be via Safari, but not Chrome\nI don't know what fps is played, but I will put the stat for nerds here.

I backed up files on my computer but not my Applications.\nIs my iPhoto lost forever? I have thousands of pictures on there! I've signed in to iCloud and the iPhoto icon is not ticked. Is everything lost? Can I call Apple and retrieve my old hard drive somehow?\n\nA: If you backed up all your files, then your library has been backed up and all you are missing is the iPhoto app. The iPhoto app has been replaced by Photos.app in Yosemite, so you can re-download iPhoto or Photos from the Mac App Store and your library will be automatically detected.\nIf you didn't back up all your files, then you need to rely on the last one thousand photos accessible in Photo Stream or Shared Photo Streams.\n\nA: Lilly, go to Apps purchases and if you purchase iPhoto in the past then you can download it again. \n", "Q: How to force photo thumbnail download on iOS 8.3 I have 30,000+ photos synced to iCloud and am trying to get their thumbnails to show on the Photos app on iOS 8.3. On the (first) Photos tab, viewing at Years or Collections levels shows lots of grey placeholders instead of photos. Only when I click into Moments do the thumbnails actually load.\nHowever, trying to scroll through all my photos at the Moments level, to trigger downloading of the thumbnail, would take hours. (It's a little faster under Albums > All Photos, but not much.)\nIs there a way to force all the thumbnails to download? I tried disabling iCloud Photo Library and re-enabling it, but it did not force a sync. Note that I have Optimize iPhone Storage set, but I thought this should still download thumbnails.\n\nA: I am having a similar problem.  All of my iOS photos have synced up to Photos on the Mac, but photos that I've added on the Mac show up blank in iOS. When I click on a photo, a blank comes up, with a progress clock in the lower right corner. However, that seems to stall at 25%. Even when I go into Edit mode, it appears to start downloading and appears to give up after 25%.\nI may try to turn off iCloud Photos and try again, but I have nearly 70k photos and videos.\n\nA: The thumbnails should all be (eventually) downloaded, but with that many photos, it may take some time. Panning over them simply tells the system to hurry up and retrieve the ones you're trying to look at.\nOn the Photos (left) tab, zoom all the way in and scroll all the way to the bottom, and it should give you the current sync status. \"XX,XXX Photos, 15 items to upload\" or similar. It may also say \"preparing items\", which also takes some time as it sorts through what's on your phone. Either way, unless it says \"Updated [just now | some date]\", it is still working on it.\n\nA: I've had almost all of the same probelms. I ended up calling Apple and they had to do a hard reset on my iCloud from their end. Bad thing is, you have to re-download all of the photos again (not fun when you have 16,000+ photos on 4 devices).\n\nA: Zoom out until you're in \"years\" view and disable \"Summarize Photos\" under Preferences > Photos & Camera.\nThat will help, now you just have to scroll through your photos once and they will be downloaded.\n\nA: Under Preferences, choose automatically lock screen option to \"Never\".\nThen, open Photos, go under the thumbnails view and let run.\n\nA: I found none of the above to work. The best solution I found was to hold your finger down in the year view to scrub through the pictures. Where you scrub it triggers the thumbnails to download. Not great, but it works. \n\nA: Here's what worked for me: Quit Photos; run Activity Monitor and search for iCloud Photos process and terminate it; re-open Photos and within a min the photos start to reload.\n", "Q: How to get all tunes downloaded to my iPhone from the cloud?

I path to\nQuickTime will not understand this and fail. Similarly:\nset frameOne of this_item to track (beginning)\nset frameEnd of this_item to track (end)\n\nQT will not know what beginning and end are\nYou should read the Quicktime 7 dictionary  to understand it's syntax.\nIn Script Editor go to the Window->Library menu\nThis will bring up the Applications Dictionary Library window.  \nI doubt QT7 is listed, so go to the finder and locate QT7. I t is normally in the /Applications/Utilities folder.\nDrag it onto the Applications Dictionary Library window.\nThen Double click it.\nA dictionary will open up.Read through it to understand what QT7 can understand.\nNow the Script.\nI have not touched any of you file checking. \nWhat I have changed is the  process_file() handler's content.\nAnd add some Objective - C to simplify getting the file path and file name.\nDon't worry too much about the Objective -c stuff. You can still use conventional Applescript that you understand if you want just replace it.\nThe important parts are:\nSetting the position of the play head and the exporting the movie.\nBecause we are using BMP it will only export the current frame.\nNotice I set the start to 0 and the end to the full duration of the movie - 20.\nFrom what I under stand the measurements are in milliseconds. So having -20 of the end should not make much difference to what you capture. But I do this because one of my Test videos had a problem getting the last frame at the full duration. I got an error saying invalid frame. Changing it to slightly before solved the issue.\nI also use a bit of command line to convert the bmp to a png.\nAgain to simplify things ( for me at least) you can use you own method here if you want.\nuse scripting additions\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\n\n\n\n(* TO FILTER FOR SPECIFIC FILES, ENTER THE APPROPRIATE DATA IN THE FOLLOWING LISTS: *)\nproperty type_list : {\"M4V \", \"mpg4\"} -- e.g.: {\"PICT\", \"JPEG\", \"TIFF\", \"GIFf\"} \nproperty extension_list : {\"mp4\", \"m4v\", \"mpg\"} -- e.g.: {\"txt\", \"text\", \"jpg\", \"jpeg\"}, NOT: {\".txt\", \".text\", \".jpg\", \".jpeg\"}\nproperty typeIDs_list : {\"public.mpeg-4\"} -- e.g.: {\"public.jpeg\", \"public.tiff\", \"public.png\"}\n\n\n-- This droplet processes files dropped onto the applet \non open these_items\n    repeat with i from 1 to the count of these_items\n        set this_item to item i of these_items\n        set the item_info to info for this_item\n        if folder of the item_info is true then\n            process_folder(this_item)\n        else\n            try\n                set this_extension to the name extension of item_info\n            on error\n                set this_extension to \"\"\n            end try\n            try\n                set this_filetype to the file type of item_info\n            on error\n                set this_filetype to \"\"\n            end try\n            try\n                set this_typeID to the type identifier of item_info\n            on error\n                set this_typeID to \"\"\n            end try\n            if (folder of the item_info is false) and (package folder of the item_info is false) and (alias of the item_info is false) and ((this_filetype is in the type_list) or (this_extension is in the extension_list) or (this_typeID is in typeIDs_list)) then\n                process_file(this_item)\n            end if\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend open\n\n-- this sub-routine processes folders \non process_folder(this_folder)\n    set these_items to list folder this_folder without invisibles\n    repeat with i from 1 to the count of these_items\n        set this_item to alias ((this_folder as Unicode text) & (item i of these_items))\n        set the item_info to info for this_item\n        if folder of the item_info is true then\n            process_folder(this_item)\n        else\n            try\n                set this_extension to the name extension of item_info\n            on error\n                set this_extension to \"\"\n            end try\n            try\n                set this_filetype to the file type of item_info\n            on error\n                set this_filetype to \"\"\n            end try\n            try\n                set this_typeID to the type identifier of item_info\n            on error\n                set this_typeID to \"\"\n            end try\n            if (folder of the item_info is false) and (package folder of the item_info is false) and (alias of the item_info is false) and ((this_filetype is in the type_list) or (this_extension is in the extension_list) or (this_typeID is in typeIDs_list)) then\n                process_file(this_item)\n            end if\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend process_folder\n\n-- this sub-routine processes files \non process_file(this_item)\n    tell application \"QuickTime Player 7\"\n        set thisDoc to open this_item -- This will open the file in Quicktime\n        tell thisDoc\n            set xFolder to its path\n            set duro to its duration\n\n        end tell\n\n    end tell\n\n    -->> Objective - c to get the name and file path\n    set xFolder to current application's NSString's stringWithString:(xFolder as string)\n\n    set file_path to ((xFolder's stringByDeletingLastPathComponent) as string) & \"/\"\n\n\n    set file_name to xFolder's lastPathComponent\n\n    set file_name to (file_name's stringByDeletingPathExtension) as string\n    --<<\n\n\n    tell application \"QuickTime Player 7\"\n        tell thisDoc\n            set current time to 0\n            set xFileStart to file_path & file_name & \"_start.png\"\n\n            export track 1 to xFileStart as BMP using default settings with replacing\n            delay 1\n            do shell script (\"sips -s format png \" & (quoted form of xFileStart)) -- convert to png\n            set current time to (duro - 20)\n            set xFileEnd to file_path & file_name & \"_end.png\"\n            export track 1 to xFileEnd as BMP using default settings with replacing\n            delay 1\n            do shell script (\"sips -s format png \" & (quoted form of xFileEnd)) -- convert to png\n        end tell\n        close thisDoc\n    end tell\nend process_file\n\n", "Q: How do I get my folder list from the dock to start at the TOP of the folder rather the bottom, when organized by date? I have a frequently used folder set up in my dock to display as a list, organized by date modified.\nThe problem here is that I have several hundred items in that folder, and most frequently I need to access the ones that are most recently modified, but I always have to scroll to the top of my long list, since Apple defaults to showing the oldest modified (i.e. the bottom of the list) by default. How does this make any sense for the user?\nAny way to change this display, so I can avoid having to move upward through 800 files and folders every time I click on the list? I changed it to display as a stack and the same thing is happening. I also tried to change the sorting to date added, and date created, only to have the same result.\n\nA: It makes sense if you think about it from a Finder perspective...when you click on Date Modified in Finder, you generally want the newest items at the top of the list.\nThat said, it doesn't make sense when the list in this case opens from the bottom (at least, not without some way to sort the opposite way). I wasn't able to find a way around this, but there are two work-arounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the keyboard shortcut Control-Command-↑ to jump up a page at a time\n\n*Use the Home key to jump straight to the top of the list (similarly, End jumps back to the bottom)\n\n\nOn a Mac keyboard without Home or End keys, the combination Fn-← stands in for Home, and Fn-→ stands in for End.\n", "Q: Apple Watch - Can third-party apps update the activity app's exercise ring?

It was pretty brilliant, and contained some KEY emoji which Apple seems to deem unimportant, including the much sought-after face palm (why leave this out Apple, WHY??).\nAnyone have any idea on how I can get these prized Blackberry emojis onto a non-jailbroken iPhone for use in Messages? I've been trying to save them as images and paste them into IM, but this method makes the emoji look too large, and it ends up looking pixelated.\nWould it possible to create and install my own custom keyboard? Any other methods or idea would be welcome.\nThanks!\nAdditional note: I can re-create/convert the Blackberry emoji in vector form, all I really need to know is how to install it as a keyboard. Is this possible on non-jailbroken devices? Alternately, is there a way to send a vector image through IM?\n\nA: iOS 8 supports 3rd party keyboards. There are several that speak in icons and gifs and whatnot. Check the AppStore for something you like or even develop your own. \n", "Q: If Thunderbolt is a successor to DisplayPort, why can't it support DisplayPort multi-streaming? As a disclaimer: Yes, I know Thunderbolt (2) is multi-stream capable of up to 6 devices in a single chain. Yes, I know you can add a single DP monitor at the end of a Thunderbolt daisy-chain as an extended desktop. That said...\nWhat prevents Thunderbolt from supporting DP 1.2a (mst)? I understand that the primary difference is Thunderbolt provides power along with its data connection. However, looking at articles like Wikipedia it makes it sound as though it shouldn't have any issue allowing a DisplayPort-only daisy-chain.\nFor example, currently you could create such chains via Thunderbolt:\nMac --TB(2)--> TB Display --TB(2)--> External RAID --mDP 1.2a--> DP monitor\n\nMac --TB(2) #1--> TB Display --mDP 1.2a--> DP Monitor\n \\----TB(2) #2--> TB Display --mDP 1.2a--> DP Monitor\n\nMac --mDP 1.2a--> DP Monitor\n\nBut you can't do this:\nMac --mDP 1.2a mst--> DisplayPort Monitor --mDP 1.2a mst--> DisplayPort Monitor\n\nthrough a Thunderbolt port and configure them both as extended desktops (the second monitor will mirror the first one).\n\nA: You should be able to and it may be a limitation of the system you are on or any intermediary devices.\nHere's my setup:  Dell Precision M3800 with nvidia Quadro K1100m graphics.  Connected out of the Thunderbolt port (by a mDisplay port cable) to a Dell U3014 monitor which is connected to another U3014 (by a full size Display port cable).  I had to enable DP1.2 on the monitor in the settings for it to work.\nI'm looking to see if I can use the Elgato Thunderbolt 2 Dock in between my laptop and the first display to utilize Network, USB, etc... in addition to dual displays.\n", "Q: Will my apps be removed from the App Store if my developer account expires? Will my apps get taken down on the App Store if I allow my developer account to expire?\n\nA: Yes, your app will be deleted from the App Store until you renew your subscription.\n\nA: Yes - all your apps will be removed from their respective App Stores if your developer program membership expires.\n\nIf your Apple Developer Program membership expires, you will still have access to iTunes Connect.

I have 3 macs that all produce this error repeatedly in the console, and I cant figure out the root cause of it.  It leads to various system stalls and memory issues.  \n(Currently troubleshooting on Yosemite 10.10.3 on a 2011 imac, 8 mb of RAM.)\n\n5/6/15 11:21:31.433 AM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.xpc.launchd.domain.user.502) Service \"com.apple.xpc.launchd.oneshot.0x10000038.AppleSpell\" tried to hijack endpoint \"it (Apple)_OpenStep\" from owner: com.apple.xpc.launchd.oneshot.0x10000004.AppleSpell\n\nIve read through various forums, some suggest its a hard drive failure, but all tests have shown my drive is totally fine, and because its a problem occuring across 3 different machines, I doubt its a HD issue.\nFrom what I understand, this is created by the systems system wide-spell check system.  This error hits the hardest when I have any mail applications open (mail, outlook, airmail, etc). \nHas anyone discovered a fix to nip this issue in the bud?  Id like to avoid disabling it completely - but if it comes to that, is there a way to do so? Ive already disabled the option within Yosmites PrefPane. \nAny help would be vastly appreciated.  I miss having my sanity.\n\nA: Let’s dig into the stalls and memory errors directly as this message cleared up for me on updating the OS. Any chance you would like to make a follow up question, just link in the comments below and I’ll gladly have a look.\nThere are more than one libraries, and you’re calling the older one and not the newer one, so this is just a versioning issue that happens from time to time AFAIK.\n", "Q: Trying to Free Up Space - Can I Delete Library Cache? I'm trying to figure out how to free up some space on my MacBook. I downloaded Disk Inventory X, and in looking at the storage breakdown it provides, I see that my Library folder is 119.4 GB. Library > Caches inside there has 96.7 GB. Caches > Adobe has 93.1 GB. Looks like After Effects is taking up the most space in there with 92 GB. That seems like an insane amount of space for one program cache. \nAlso, Library > Application Support has 21.8 GB. And Application Support > Adobe has 20.2 GB.\nWhat can I delete without messing up my computer? I use the Adobe Suite pretty much every day, so I don't want to screw it up.\n\nA: Yes you can delete anything in the Cache folder. There's no unsaved things. Just cached data. Like renderinged things in the case of After Effects. \nIn video editing software you can often define maximum cache size. \n", "Q: A partition copied with cat can't be mounted Well some days ago my mac got broken, I had an Ubuntu on it and booted through it, first thing I did I copied mac partition to an external hard partition, something like this:\ncat /dev/sda2 > /dev/sdc2\n\nI was able to mount the sda2 partition in Ubuntu with hfsprogs, but I wasn't able to mount /dev/sdc2, I made a diff on two devices (with cmp) and they were just identical, now I erase sda2 and installed Yosemite again but I can't mount sdc2 even on mac (here it's disk2s2).\nWhen I try to mount, verify or repair it, I get this error:\nInvalid node structure\n\n(this is the same error I got in Ubuntu for this partition), it's really weird cause I'm sure this partition is identical to the real one (and I was able to mount the real one in Ubuntu) I tried fixing it with DiskWarrior 5, it did its job without any error, but it didn't fix it.\n\nA: cat is not an appropriate tool for copying volumes. It dumps files character by character. Yes, unix abstracts everything to a file, but it also distinguishes between character devices (files) and block devices (storage).\nWipe the partition and use dd, rsync, or a GUI tool like Carbon Copy Cloner to make a duplicate.\nHowever, if I read your sequence correctly it looks like you made a copy and then wiped the original without verifying your copy. If so, time to get the backups out.\n", "Q: How to disable Incognito mode in Chrome? For Mac OS X, how do you disable Incognito mode in Chrome? The desired result simply being that the user cannot browse in Incognito mode, even if they know the keyboard shortcut or something similar.\n\nA: Rather than converting the plist and manually editing it, you can set the option in one step. In the Terminal, run:\ndefaults write com.google.chrome IncognitoModeAvailability -integer 1\n\nThen reboot or run:\nkillall cfprefsd\n\nto reload the plist cache. It is not enough to quit and relaunch Chrome, or even to logout and login again.\nIncognitoModeAvailability can be set to 0, 1, or 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*0 means Incognito is enabled\n\n*1 means Incognito is disabled\n\n*2 means Incognito is forced\n\n\nA: Here's an updated way for macOS Sierra.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a plist editing program like PrefSetter.\n\n*Using Finder, go to the ~/Library/Preferences/ folder. \n\n*Copy and paste an existing plist file, (I used com.google.Keystone.agent.plist). \n\n*Now open that copied file using PrefSetter, and rename it com.google.Chrome.\n\n*Delete all existing keys, and create a new key, giving it the name: IncognitoModeAvailability.\n\n*Under class, choose Integer, and under value, enter 1.\n\n*Now save this file, and copy and paste it into the /Library/Preferences folder as well. (Remember this isn't the same folder as ~/Library/Preferences folder)\n\n*Restart your computer, and viola, it should work!\n\n\nA: The short answer: you must edit the preferences file so that the key IncognitoModeAvailability has a value of 1.\nOriginal Instructions\nIn /Library/Preferences/ add a plist entry to the file com.google.Chrome.plist such that the key is IncognitoModeAvailability and the value is 1.\nHere is an example: assuming the file com.google.Chrome.plist doesn't exist, use a text editor to save the following code:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n   <key>IncognitoModeAvailability</key>\n   <integer>1</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe full file name and path of the above should be /Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist.\nUpdated Instructions\nSince macOS Sierra, proper plist files seem to be in some binary format by default—a format that you can't edit with a normal text editor. I found that I can open them in Apple's Xcode and it has a nice GUI—very easy to edit. If you don't have access to Xcode, I think you can use the plutil terminal command like this:\nplutil -convert xml1 YOUR_FILE_NAME_HERE\n\nIn xml format, you should be able to edit it in a text editor, and a web site I read says that the xml format should work fine.\nRegardless, I recently was able to disable Incognito mode using Xcode on the ~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist file. (Furthermore, I had to delete /Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist because my old version was deemed \"corrupted\" because it wasn't in a proper file format.)\n\nA: I've seen a bunch of very complicated directions/suggestions for how to disable Incognito in Google Chrome for Mac OS X, but I've found a much simpler method.\nSimply open up Chrome, click on \"Chrome\" in the upper-left hand corner; click on \"Preferences\"; click on \"Settings\"; scroll to the very bottom and click on \"Show Advanced Settings\"; scroll to the very bottom and click on \"Reset Settings.\" Voila! But, now your settings are at their original settings, so you'll now have to go and reset those settings that you want to change from their original state.\n", "Q: SSD on Macbook mid2010 I've just installed a new SSD on my old Macbook mid2010 in the CD unit, so i took away the cds, to upgrade to this new extra Hard drive. \nOn the other side, I replace my old HD for a new 1tb HD so I can save my Multimedia data on it, without taking place of the space the SSD has for opperational use. \nIt works great, because I start over with the finder and it runs great booting from the SSD. But I still have the question if it would be better, if I plugged the SSD in the old HD slot. The question came to after i did the whole upgrade. \nShould be better the other way around?\n\nA: As johnfinn68 answered in this Apple Discussions post:\n\nTo determine [the bus speed of HDD and SuperDrive slots], go to the apple icon, about this mac, more info,select Serial ATA, then look at the (on mine) Nvidia AHCI and see the Link Speed and Negotiated Link speed.  The default one shown is the HDD, you need to click on the other AHCI channel to see the optical drive specs.  This will help you determine where to put the SSD.\n\n", "Q: On OS 9.2.1, how can you access shared files from windows computers? I'm a total newbie Mac user. I got a Powerbook 3 Pismo off of ebay, got OS 9.2.1 installed, and enabled file sharing. Web browsing is working and I have an IP address.\nHow do I access the shared folder from my windows 8 machines?\n\nA: Mac OS 9 has no built-in support for Windows file sharing. There were third-party file sharing applications for Mac OS to allow access to Windows networks, and there were also Windows server tools which could allow Mac access to Windows servers. One tool I remember using was DAVE, from Thursby software. It used to be a Windows networking kit for Mac, but has morphed into something else now. If you found an older version it might work, but I doubt it would be compatible with the latest Windows.\nI'd recommend looking for an FTP server for your Windows machine and a FTP client for your Mac.\n\nA: Not a specific answer to the question, but one alternative is to use a FAT32 formatted USB stick. This is compatible with OS 9. Setting up an FTP server to migrate files back and forth is handy in the moment, but going back and forth between the two systems to turn on the server, connect, move files probably takes longer than just putting on the USB stick.\n\nA: Aside from the aforementioned Thursby DAVE, which surprisingly is still an active commercial product, another option would be Connectix DoubleTalk, which is apparently abandonware obtainable from the Macintosh Garden.\nUnlike DAVE which provides both client and server SMB functionality, DoubleTalk is only a SMB client, not a server, so you'd need to perform your file-transferring from the old Mac's end with that -- i.e., Windows won't be able to see any shares on the Mac, but the Mac would be able to find and access shares on Windows. I found this write-up explaining the process.\n", "Q: Changing Apple ID on iPhone 5 How can I change my Apple ID on my iphone 5 to match the Apple ID on my iPad Air?

Apple will send a verification email to that address.\n  \n*Open the email from Apple, then click Verify Now. Didn't receive the email?\n  \n*When the My Apple ID page opens, sign in with your new Apple ID email address and password. When you see a message that verification is complete, you can start using your updated Apple ID.\n  \n*Update the features and services that you use with Apple ID, so that each one is using your updated Apple ID.\n  \n  \n  If you need to change the Apple ID that's signed in to your iOS device, use these steps to sign out, then back in with a different Apple ID.\n\n", "Q: Why does my home network not show up sometimes in my network listings? I'm using a MacBOok Pro, Mac 10.9.5.  It happens frequently that when I wake my Mac from hibernation or simply reboot, my home network is not automatically selected in the \"Network\" section in my System Preferences.  When I open the \"Network Name:\" drop down menu, I don't see it in there either.  However, if I click the \"Turn Wi-Fi Off\" and \"Turn Wi-Fi On\" one or multiple times, it does eventually appear and eitehr it gets automatically selected or I can select it myself.\nMy question is, how I can always get it to appear in my network list (assuming I am at home and my router is turned on)?  Note I am always within 15 feet of my router (LinkSys E900).\n\nA: Your 10.9.5 and your Router are having problem of identity.\nYour 10.9.5 can not find the correct name, or your router is not broadcasting it correctly. \nSo try changing the name of your Network, and make sure it is moved to the Top of the Network list and choose different Chanel. \nAlso you could tell the router that your MAC address belongs to trusted ones.\nI would not panic but on they web site they skipped 10.9.5 (Mavericks) and call it Yosemite ?\nProbably just a stupid typo :)\n\nMac OS X 10.7 Lion Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion Mac OS X 10.9 Yosemite\n\n", "Q: Alternatives for Suggested Routes Apple maps shows \"1 of 3 Suggested Routes\".\nHow do I get to see the alternatives?\n\nA: When Apple Maps shows alternate routes they'll appear in a lighter color then the primary route and touching the alternate route shift the darker color to it, changing the route details, while the previous focused route is now the lighter one.\n", "Q: How to use Mission Control with multiple monitors? I'm using a MPBr + Yosemite with 2x 27\" monitors.\nI also use parallels with Win8 for development.\nI'm hoping to have 2x 'spaces'. (I'm not sure if that's the best way to describe this). Each space uses BOTH monitors.\n1st space (space_1) is my OSX space.

(eg. email/slack/chrome windows).\n\n*When I click on the windows application in my dock, everything in space_1 disappears away .. and suddenly my windows environment takes over BOTH monitors ... and this is what I call space_2.\n\n\nI'm trying to do this with Mission Control but it's not working right. When i click on a mac app or a windows app (in the dock) only one of the two monitors changes .. not both :(\nIt's very frustrating.\nIs this possible? Can what I'm asking, be done?\nHelp me AskDifferent, you're my only hope.\n\n\nA: Why not use one \"space\" and place the parallels apps on monitor 2 and mac apps on monitor 1?\nSpaces is like completely new environment of all monitors attached and can't be used in different way.\nMaybe this question is a bit old and it's available since Yosemite and El Capitan.\n", "Q: Feasibility of swapping two MacBook Pros (both hard drive and RAM)? I have an early 2011 MacBook Pro, and my sister has a mid-2012. I've already seen the suggested duplicate possibilities that say that just swapping the hard drives shouldn't be problematic, but I've got another layer: I've got 10GB of RAM, an eBay-bought 8GB module and one of the OEM 2GB modules, that I'd very much like to keep.\nWikipedia says the two generations have different RAM specs - the early 2011 has \"1333 MHz PC3-10600 DDR3 SDRAM, Voltage 1.5V\" and the mid-2012 has \"1600 MHz PC3-12800 DDR3 SDRAM, Voltage 1.35V.\" I'm going to take an educated guess that mixing frequencies/voltages won't end well, but what if I swapped the pairs of RAM modules? As in, what would happen if I were to put 10GB of RAM designed for early 2011 into mid-2012 and 4GB of RAM designed for mid-2012 into early 2011?\n\nA: The RAM speed won't be a problem, the system will detect the speed of the RAM and run it at the maximum compatible speed. Hard drives also won't be a problem. (you will want to do a \"fresh\" install of the operating system)\nAs for the RAM voltage, I think that would be a problem. I'm not completely sure though. Whatever you do, make sure you run the Apple Hardware Test and babysit the machine while its running. Chances are if it passes all the tests, you're good.\n", "Q: How to bring up the iTunes podcast video window?

Where find download/install files? Too many major websites are using features that in-effect are \"walking away from\" my old OS 10.3.9 and Firefox 2. (That is, my favorite browser, and its available plugins and extensions, are starting to no longer render some common websites properly, or at all.)  I would like to experiment with alternative browsers but do not know which ones have archived \"antique\" versions that can be downloaded and installed on such an old Mac.  Any advice (apart from \"Upgrade to 10.4...\")?  My machine is a PowerPC \"iMac\" -- the version with the white half-sphere base and the moderately thick flat-screen on a \"stalk\" -- sort of like the movie \"Wall-E\" but with a rounded body.\n\nA: \"Upgrade\" is going to be the standard answer. Your computer is over 10 years old now, has a slower processor and less memory than my phone, and is well into the timeframe where it can be expected to stop working without notice. If you still have the original disk drive, it is now at twice it's expected service life. But of course you have a backup.\nMost software vendors do have old-version archives, but you have to dig for them. Most websites do not maintain compatible versions - mine certainly do not, I cut off at IE9 and I do not test older versions of Chrome, Firefox etc. I'm a bit surprised this site runs on Firefox 2.\nYou can get a brand-new Air or iMac for $1000. For twice that you can put a 27 inch model on your desk, either one running the latest of everything. And you're good for another decade.\n\nA: You should upgrade.

I'm following this guide to install Linux commands onto my OS Terminal: https://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x/ and I see that the second line tells me to add a line to my .bashrc file, which I have to create since I don't have one. Can anyone explain to me what this does? As well as the PATH command in general? \n\nA: When you run a command in bash (or any other Unix shell), the shell searches for this command in a number of directories. The list of directories is stored in the variable called PATH, paths are separated by :.\nThe command in question extends the already defined $PATH by two additional paths:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/local/bin which is the usual place user-provided commands get installed to\n\n*The output of $(brew --prefix coreutils)/libexec/gnubin which points to some utility commands required by brew\n\n\nTo see the current value of PATH, run echo $PATH in Terminal.\n\nA: A .bashrc file can store and set a number of variables and commands that are executed (run) when you launch bash, which is one of many shells you can use to type commands into the Linux/Unix system.\nFor comparison, if you prefer the shell zsh then you would create a .zshrc file.\n", "Q: Howto run a Terminal command using shortcut or a button I always have the problem in my dock, where the download bar just stops and stays froze. I know you can do a killall -KILL Dock and it will fix the issue.\nIs there a way to click a button or do a keyboard-shortcut that runs this Terminal command?\n\nA: There are multiple ways to do this, here are 2.\nFirst method: Create a quick script that runs after a double-click.\nCreate a text file, named myScript.command. The '.command' postfix will let Finder know to run it on opening.\nAdd the following as plain text:\n#!/bin/bash\nkillall -KILL Dock\n\nNow the script exists but needs to be executable. To do this you need to do a chmod.\nchmod 755 myScript.command \n\nRunning myScript.command will open a Terminal window and run the command.

(A lot more of an issue with video but this also happens with general music playing.) \nI'll then have to pause the media, wait about 10 seconds, and hit play again and then playback will be fine until it goes out of sync again 20 minutes later.\nI've searched a lot online for this issue, and I can't really find many resources to fix the problem.  Is anyone aware of what might be causing the problem? Maybe a solution?\nHardware: Macbook Pro (mid 2014), Yosemite (10.10.3). \n\nA: Turns out it was a bug with an equaliser app I was using, Boom 2.  \nThey have fixed this in their latest update.  \nHope this helps anyone with the same issue. \n", "Q: Will video and photo editing wear out a 2015 macbook pro's SSD significantly? I plan on buying the latest 2015 13\" Macbook pro while travelling for video and photo editing (among other activities such as programming). The SSD size will probably be 256 or 512gb along with a 2TB WD passport external I own.\nWill transferring a large amount of video clips to the SSD and deleting after completion regularly wear out my Macbook pro's lifetime significantly or only by an unnoticeable time?\n\nA: SSD's have been found to be quite durable.

Two connections are on thunderbolt (with TB->HDMI adaptors) and one on the HDMI port. I would like to use one of the thunderbolt ports for another peripheral. Is there a way to daisy chain two monitors on a single TB port? \n\nA: You can chain up to 12 thunderbolt devices of any kind. If you want to connect a non-thunderbolt device, make sure you put it at the end of the chain.\nAlso keep in mind that Apple, for some reason, doesn't allow 3rd party-non-thunderbolt-displays chained directly after their own Thunderbolt Display. However it will work if another thunderbolt-device is inbetween.\n", "Q: Applications in ~/Applications not shown in Applications folder in dock I just noticed that brew cask install symlinks to ~/Applications. This works fine, but the application item in my dock does not show apps from that folder. Is it supposed to work this way? I expected to have an aggregated view of /Applications and ~/Applications in my dock.\n\nA: Each item in the dock is a single folder. \nOS X does not have merged folder views except in Finder where there are Smart folders\nHowever you could create a smart folder in Finder of Kind is Application and drag that to the Dock\n\nA: Another way is to force brew cask install to create the links in the root Applications directory.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*--appdir=/my/path changes the path where the symlinks to the applications (above) will be generated. This is commonly used to\n  create the links in the root Applications directory instead of the\n  home Applications directory by specifying --appdir=/Applications.\n  Default is ~/Applications.\n  \n  \n  To make these settings persistent, you might want to add the following\n  line to your .bash_profile or .zshenv:\n# Specify your defaults in this environment variable\nexport HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS=\"--appdir=/Applications --caskroom=/etc/Caskroom\"\n\n\nSource: How to Use Homebrew-cask\n", "Q: Spotlight does not show contents from internet! \nSpotlight does not show contents from the internet.

While trying to install fink-0.38.4 I get the ERROR: There is no C compiler on your system. Make sure that the Developer Tools are installed.\nI have got errors about missing a C compiler while trying to install some other things too, but I don't remember which packets that were.\nI am a designer and need to install a packet called Emokit, but I am totally oblivious to all these open source things I had to install. I am in way over my head, which is why I made a giant mess. To name some stuff I have installed in the last couple of days: MacPorts, Homebrew, Xcode, X11, FoxToolkit, hidapi (maybe, I am not sure if I installed this correctly or not), python, cython, and a couple more and some libraries as well. While doing this I have learned what some things are. I know now that MacPorts and Homebrew serve a similar purpose and having them both is making trouble. However I don't dare to delete one of them because I think some stuff relies on them.\nI have multiple versions of GCC, but because some installations wanted a different version, I tried to switch from one version to another version some times. It sometimes worked and sometimes didn't.

Apple seems to be deliberately mocking me!\nI have a laptop running Yosemite El Capitan with an external monitor sitting above next to the laptops display.  When I am logged in I have the display arrangement mimicking the physical above and below side by side layout.  This works and is good.\nHowever when I am logged out the Yosemite El Capitan login screen reverts to an side by side above and below arrangement.  \nI would like Yosemite El Capitan to keep the side by side arrangement even when I am logged out, but the display arrangement in the System Preferences is per logged in account.  \nSo what would I do to set the arrangement when there is no logged in account?\n\nA: I think I may have just solved it.  I have two accounts on this Mac, my Admin account and my daily use account.  The admin account didn't have the same screen orientation as the the daily use account, and on the login screen the admin account was listed first.  I suspect that when no accounts are logged in that OS X grabs the screen configuration of the first account that it finds - which happened to be the admin account in my case.\n", "Q: Disabling password saving for certificates I work in a HIPAA environment where we purposefully put passwords on our certificates. However, when connecting to one of our servers via SSH, it seems keychain is 'remembering' the password between restarts and hasn't been prompting me each time (as it needs to).\nHow can I disable this session-like behavior, so certificate passwords produce a prompt each time they are used?\n\nA: When the system prompts you to save your session in the following dialog:\n\nMake sure that you do NOT check the Remember password in my keychain checkbox.  If you did check that, then you can always delete that saved password in the Keychain Access app, located in your Utilities folder:\n\nNotice that even if you don't check the box, SSH does cache your password until a reboot.\nDave Dribin has an excellent breakdown of what's actually going on with OS X's SSH Keychain integration: http://www.dribin.org/dave/blog/archives/2007/11/28/ssh_agent_leopard/\nSummary:\n\nThe real benefit, though, is the second checkbox: “Remember password in my keychain.” While it does store the passphrase in your keychain, it actually does more than that. It also adds the identity to your ssh-agent for you.\nBy adding your identity to the agent, you can now log right back into the same machine, without typing any passphrase. However, ssh does not prompt for you passphrase because it gets it from the agent, not your keychain. Remove your identity from the agent, and try again:\n\n% ssh-add -D\nAll identities removed.\n\n\nLocking your Keychain\nThe other thing to consider is just locking your keychain after a reboot or sleeping.  This will essentially give you the behavior that you're looking for as well.\nYou can do this from the Keychain Access utility, by right-clicking on the keychain that your private key's password is saved in, and clicking on Change Settings for Keychain '<YOUR_KEYCHAIN_NAME>'\nThe following dialog will appear:\n\nJust select the one that best fits your compliance requirements.\n\nA: sorry assuming using a mac.\nopen favorite text editor, bbedit, textwrangler, vi, etc,..\ncd ~\ncd .ssh\nvi knownhosts\n\nlocate the shared key\ndelete all of them, if there are multiple.\nsave and ssh to server and they will negotiate again.\n-x\n\n", "Q: Unable to connect internet from any browser but chrome I am on OSX Yosemite 10.10.3 on MacBook Pro (Early 2011) and I am not able to connect to internet from any browser except chrome.

Please help.\nWhen I try to use diagnostics Internet and Server shows Red, rest all are Green. \n\nA: Open Network Preferences, and:\n\n\n*\n\n*verify IP \n\n*verify gateway\n\n*verify DNS\nYour IP address is either static or dynamic. Static: you put in your IP info. Dynamic: your gateway provides the correct IP info.\nOpen Terminal.app, and type:\n ifconfig -a \n\nThat will show you what network interfaces you have. One of these is your primary route and your default gateway. You can only have one default gateway. Even though you may have many interfaces (ethernet, wireless and firewire, etc), there's only one default way to go if the request is not local.\nSo check for default route by typing in Terminal.app:\nnetstat -nr | more\n\nThe top two resulting lines will tell you who's the boss.\nThen ping the gateway.\nping <IP address>\n\nIf it doesn't work, reboot and try again.

I am trying to Launch a process using NICE but this process is starting other process by itself and they are not affected by the priority of the main process ( main process has the correct nice but sub process priority is set to default)\nSo I am trying to renice those process while they run.\nI tried\n renice n -p $(pidof <process name>)\n\nbut it is not recognised by MacOS (it is probably linux specific ?)\nso how can I do that? \nyou can find a related discussion here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/30062340/starting-process-with-nice-command-macos-leaves-the-process-priority-at-0#comment48287323_30062340\nthanks.\n\nA: You can use pgrep instead of pidof on OS X. Using your example from earlier, the following should work:\nrenice n -p $(pgrep <process name>)\n\nThat said, a child started after the parent has had their priority changed should inherit the parent's priority.  \n\nA: There are multiple correct answers, here an answer let suits your train of thought.\nRun this oneliner:\nrenice 10 -p $(ps -ax | grep -i [p]rocessname | awk 'NR==1{print $1}')\n\nWhat is does:\n\n\n*\n\n*renice 10, this will make your process run with the nicety of ten, the nicer, the higher the number.\n\n*-p expects the process id\n\n*ps -ax lists all running processes with there name and PID\n\n*grep -i [p]rocessname only matches the processes with 'processname', case insensitive. the brackets will prevent to match the grep process itself.\n\n*awk 'NR==1{print $1}' will fetch the 1st instance (NR==1) of the first column ($1)\n\n\nYou already gave a good example of command substitution. \n", "Q: Color changing of the window title bar Is it possible to change the color of the window title bar (possibly with Terminal.app) like in Firefox?\n\n\nA: If you would like a GUI, then CrystalClear might be for you.

I'm looking to buy my first macbook and I am unsure which one to buy. I will use my laptop while travelling mostly next year on my working holiday visa for general purposes (web browsing, watching movies etc), photo editing (Photoshop), occasional video editing (premiere) and android development.\nI cannot decided which model to buy:\n13\" MacBook Air full upgraded ( 2.2GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz, 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM, 256GB SSD)\nvs\n13\" MacBook Pro (2.7GHz Dual-core Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz, 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM, 256GB SSD)\nboth are priced at S$1,968.00 - might even go for the 512GB - also same price for both (S$2,388) but I'm not sure yet as I'll carry a 2TB external with me.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm frustrated why Apply still use Dual core CPU when there are so many quad cores available\n\n\nMy questions:\nCould a full upgraded MacBook Air match/exceed the Pro in terms of performance? Would a fully upgraded MacBook Air have shorter battery life than the quoted 12 hours?\n\nA: I would go with MacBook Pro for the better CPU, GPU (iris vs HD), and screen resolution since you are going to work with photo and video editing.\n\nA: I currently use a maxed out 11\" MacBook Air which gets 10+ hours out of browsing with Chrome, with music playing from iTunes or YouTube most of the time. It can handle GIMP and Photoshop, video editing (tested with iMovie) and development with Xcode, Eclipse, Komodo and Brackets. I have experienced no problems with running games on High graphics settings both on the Mac OS and a Windows dual boot. Animation Rendering takes a little while, but nothing ridiculous. I am extremely happy with it's portability and charging time (roughly 3-4 hours). The only thing I would say is if you are planning to use it at home a lot, consider investing in a Thunderbolt display, because it adds more ports for things such as DVD drives and it gives you a bigger workspace when at home.\n\nA: Go for the MacBook Pro.\nIt'll handle better video editing and photo editing software, and it's more powerful speaking about CPU.\nIt's built for professional worker and who need performance.\nAnother good point is that you will be able to upgrade RAM and SSD in the future, which is not true for the MacBook Air (they are soldered). \nI've got a MBP 13\" mid 2010, Core Duo 2.66 GHz, 8GB RAM, and it's very good and able to run all the software provided by Adobe. \n", "Q: Yosemite randomly switches audio output to displayport Ever since upgrading from Mavericks to Yosemite I'm experiencing this annoying bug, where OSX switched the default audio output to external display connected via DisplayPort. This display has no speakers nor audio port of any kind.\n\nIs there a permanent work around for this? Can I somehow blacklist a device as audio output? \nSystem info:\n\n\nA: System Preferences builds a preferred list for your audio outputs and inputs based on which ones you pick over others.\nTo work around this you will need to manually select the audio output you would rather use once when the undesired one is available and again when it isn't. This method will work in most (but not all) cases.\n", "Q: How to mark as read e-mails from a certain person in mail app There is e-mail group that I'm a part of.

Is there a way to mark these e-mails as read in mail app automatically? Just to be clear, I want to keep everything else unread unless I read them. I just want the e-mails from this specific group to be marked as read.\n\nA: Using the \"Rules\" feature of Mail in Yosemite, you can make it so emails from a certain address are automatically marked as read by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Preferences (CMD + , or Preferences in the Mail Menu)\n\n*Navigate to the Rules Tab (furthest to the right)\n\n*\"Add Rule\"\n\n*Condition: \"From\" \"is equal to\" \"(email goes here)\"\n\n*Action: \"Mark as Read\"\n\n", "Q: Have 2 iCloud accounts in my mac and don't know how I have 2 iCloud accounts and don't know how, I tried to delete the deactivated one (the bottom one in the image) but when i deleted it, my mac deleted the other (which was active).\n\nWhen the 2 accounts was deleted I created again my iCloud account but still have 2 iCloud accounts.\nHow I resolve this issue?\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nA: I have two iCloud accounts on my Mac (and in fact, most of my selected iOS devices) because of the way Apple IDs work. \nOne of them iCloud accounts is used for iCloud syncing, etc and the email address attached to it is not of an Apple-owned domain (e.g. @icloud.com, @me.com). \nThe second iCloud account is most likely your iCloud email account. \n", "Q: Can I set the \"Exercise\" goal for my Apple Watch Activity app? The Apple Watch Activity allows for setting an overall \"Move\" goal, but I don't see how to change the green \"Exercise\" goal from the default 30 minutes. Is there a way to accomplish this?\n\nA: You aren't limited to one time around the ring in the Activity app. You get a double arrow for 1 hour of exercise, for example. You also receive awards for doubling or tripling the exercise ring. \nYou can use the Workout app to set whatever exercise goal you like. And you get a custom ring to fill in that app, based on target calories, distance, or time. \n\nA: Most of the answers in this thread are incorrect. As of posting this, you can not change the exercise goal. As stated in the first answer this is set firm.\nAdditionally, the exercise ring always has a double-arrow. The icon does not change.\n\nA: watchOS 7 enables changing the green Exercise Goal.\n\nApple Watch > Activity app > Scroll to Bottom > Change Goals\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://kirkville.com/change-activity-goals-on-the-apple-watch-in-watchos-7/\n\n*https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/09/24/mcelhearn-watchos-7-goals\n\nA: No there is no way to accomplish this.\nFrom Apple - Apple Watch\n\nYou close the Exercise ring when you reach the globally recommended 30 minutes of exercise per day. And you don’t even have to do it all at once, which means you’re more likely to fit it into your day.\n\nFrom all searches I have performed I have not found any possible way to change it and the above quote suggests that 30 minutes is the amount Apple has fixed on (the call it \"recommended\"). \n\nA: You open the activity app on your watch, then use force touch to adjust your daily goals. However, you can only modify the daily move goal (calorie goal), but not exercise or stand goal at this time.\n\nA: On your watch, press hard on the activity screen in the activity app. You can increase/decrease the daily calorie burn goal. Doesn't look like you can change any other as of yet.\n\nA: I know exactly what you mean...When setting up the Apple Watch, they ask you whether you want the 30 min. for MOVE to be easy, medium, or strenuous. But once it's been set up there is no way to change it to either of the other levels.\n", "Q: How can I make Instagram photos shared to Facebook visible to my friends by default?

In fact, Instagram's help page says that is what is supposed to happen.\nHow can I fix this? How can I make these photos visible to my friends by default?\n\nA: As Andrew Ferrier stated in the comments to the question, this is indeed a part of Facebook's privacy settings. Here is how you set it to share to \"Friends\" by default:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Facebook.com.\n\n*Find the page to edit your Instagram settings.\n\n*\n\n*this should be on YourLinkToTimelinePage/app_instapp\n\n*or you should be able to find it at https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications\n\n*or in the timeline menu under your profile picture, find it in More\n\n\n*Change your App visibility and post audience setting to Friends\nThis setting controls who on Facebook can see that you use this app. It also allows you to choose the audience for posts the app makes on your behalf.\nHope this helps you.\n", "Q: iCloud not syncing all the contacts? So, I saved my contacts from a .vcf file to my iPhone, then I created an iCloud account to back up my contacts.

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, for the next action to work.\n\n*Now go to CONTACTS, hit ctrl+a (will select all your contacts), then go up to the ribbon and on the SHARE section, where it reads Forward Contact, click on the drop down and select As Business Cards (if you don´t do step one, outlook will crash attempting to create images of the vcards for each contact on an email message).\n3.If you did right, now you have a new email window opened, with all your vcards as attachment. select all the Vcards and copy.\n4.Create a folder in C: and paste all those vcards in there.\n5.Time to merge all vcards into a single one, for them to be uploaded into your GMAIL account, follow the instructions here \nhttp://www.creativeworld9.com/2011/04/how-to-combine-all-vcf-files-to-single.htm \nl. \nThis link will teach you how to merge various VCF using the command prompt.\n7.Once you managed to create one single .vcf files with all your contacts (don´t try to open it cause you will see nothing), go to your gmail account and import them. to do that, on the left upper corner of the screen, 3rd row, you’ll see the word GMAIL, click the dropdown there and select contacts. \nMoving along the same row, go to More, click the dropdown and select import contacts, then select the VCF file and voilà….you contacts are now in GMAIL.\n8.Now we will export the contacts select ALL contacts (if you have more than 100 contacts, you will need to do this in 3 or 4 pieces, selecting no more than 100 contacts to export) , then hit more and select export contacts.

I really wanna do this on my watch too. It looks awesome but I just don't wanna damage my Apple Watch.\n\nA: Is it possible to paint your watch gold? yes. \nIs it a smart thing to do?  questionable. \nIf you are good at spray painting you could do this.\nIt is possible that if your spray too much in the right spot, like around buttons, it could leak into the watch. \nI would not suggest it because if you have issues with your watch it will void the warranty on your watch because you painted the watch, and looking up your serial number will show the color of the watch. If you don't mind voiding the warranty on your watch and you are really good at spray painting then you can go for it. \nPersonally, I would not do it.\n\nA: \nTo gild refined gold, to paint the lily,\n  To throw a perfume on the violet,\n  To smooth the ice, or add another hue\n  Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light\n  To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,\n  Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.  \nWm. Shakespeare.\n\n\nA: I would be seriously concerned about the aftermath of the paint-job. It is advisable that you check the water-proof information of the watch. Even though paint is more viscous that water, I personally won't do it. I would still be doubtful about the harm the paint chemicals can do to my hands or the material of the watch itself. \nSo I advise that we stay happy in what god has given us and not run after fake gold. \n", "Q: Restarting automatically My macbook pro automatically restarting and it shows your computer restarted because of a problem... \nHow can I solve this problem?\n\n\nA: That's a kernel panic, and from the error message, it seems like you're having issues with NVRAM. If this keeps restarting itself, I'd suggest you bring it in to an Apple store for a Genius to take a look at. \nResetting the NVRAM may also help, link: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063\n", "Q: -bash: command not found appears every time I just recently discovered what terminal was.

When this iPhone got delivered and I turned it on, it asked me for the PIN code of the previous owner and noticed that the iPhone 's language was completly in French.\nWhen trying the most common PIN codes (0000, 1234, 4321, etc...), and all attempts failed (from all the tries, I had to wait an hour to try again....), I decided restoring it in iTunes.\nAfter restoring it in iTunes to the latest supported IOS; 7.1.2, and putting an SIM card into the phone, I had to configure the language and such. After that screen, it asked me to login on the previous owner's iCloud account.\nThe problem is, I dont know the previous owner of the iPhone.\nCan I remove the previous owner's iCloud settings from the phone?\n\nA: No.\nYou need to contact the person who sold you the phone and get them to either give you the iCloud details, or give you your money back.\nThe phone can not be activated by Apple until it has been unlocked using the iCloud details (login and password) that it was locked with. This is a security measure to stop stolen phones from being useful to people.\nIf the seller does not have the iCloud details, then it was probably not their phone to sell, and they should return your money.\nSorry.\n", "Q: Can you put 2012 macbook air 13 inch ssd in macbook air 11 inch 2012?

When he's in the overview tab in the \"About this Mac\" section his version of OS X is displayed in a weird form - with numbers. The screenshot will explain more:\n\nHow do I restore the proper name of the OS X?\n\nA: I noticed that your friend's installation appears to be in Dutch, so I suspect that this is a localization / language issue. If you search the web a bit for \"yosemite 135122\" you will find others with non-English OSX installations reporting the same issue. It seems like this particular string was not properly \"translated\" into other languages.

I have the laptop in a vertical holder that holds it in the closed position.  The monitor is connected to the rMBP using a mini display->display port cable, provided by Dell.  In case it matters, max res from the laptop is 2560x1440 (my older rMBP apparently can't handle the full 4k res the monitor can do...whatever).  My rMBP was the top-of-the-line when I bought it, so it has the NVIDIA GT 650M 1gb.\nThe problem I am having is that all of the windows get shoved into the upper-left corner ever time I wake the laptop from sleep/screensaver.  I am guessing that OS is reverting back to the screen res of the build-in monitor, which has a higher res but smaller desktop real estate, when everything goes to sleep.  This is getting annoying as I typically work with many windows open and placed in particular areas.  How can I tell OS X to stop moving my windows around?\n\nA: It may be actually worth resetting the NVRAM and SMC (in that order) to see if this resolves your issues. Before doing so, unplug all external devices (including monitors, keyboard, etc).\nResetting NVRAM on your model MacBook Pro\nYour Mac use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM) to store a whole range of settings.

I’m ready to upgrade my hardware but in a dilemma over what to buy, since I’m not completely sure what I need. I have a feeling that I’m going to throw money at a setup which will end up being serious overkill. I’m a web/graphic designer and web developer with a view to possibly get into iOS development in the future.\n\nTypically, I have open the following apps simultaneously:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari (10-20 tabs)\n\n*Chrome (5-10 tabs)\n\n*Mail\n\n*OmniFocus\n\n*Evernote\n\n*Coda 2\n\n*Fireworks and/or Photoshop CS6\n\n*MAMP Pro\n\n*Sequel Pro\n\n*Xcode (possibly and without Chrome/Coda/FW/PS/MAMP)\n\n\n\nAnd these are my current choices (13” for portability purposes, since it will be used at least for commuting):\n\n\n*\n\n*First:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac Retina, 4GHz Quad-core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\n\n*13\" MacBook Pro Retina, 2.7GHz Dual-core i5, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD\n\n*~£3600\n\n\n*Second:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac Retina, 3.5GHz Quad-core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\n\n*13\" MacBook Pro Retina, 2.7GHz Dual-core i5, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD\n\n*~£3350\n\n\n*Third:\n\n\n*\n\n*13\" MacBook Pro Retina, 3.1GHz Dual-core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\n\n*27\" Thunderbolt Display\n\n*~£2630\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest factors for me are the relevance of the processor in my situation (quad- vs dual-core), and the actual benefit felt from the 5K display.\nI’m not particularly concerned about the cost but I definitely wouldn’t say it is not a factor - hence the £1000 difference between the former and latter setups really tempts me! So, my ideal option is the third one, although I'm not this setup would be sufficient for my needs.\nMany thanks in advance for any replies to this exhaustive question!\n\nA: I believe that your third option will be easiest to work with, since you have the mobility that you desire (i.e., 13\" model), which can be connected to the 27\" display when in the office. In particular, the system should be responsive when hooked to the external display, even with all the windows and applications that are running simultaneously.\nOne thing I'd suggest is to get 13\" model that can be upgraded to 1TB storage. You'll be getting years of usage out of the macbook, and you don't want to be starved for storage when undertaking new types of projects in the future, such as the iOS development that you mention (not to say there is huge overhead with iOS, just that you want to be prepared for something that wasn't anticipated).\n", "Q: Use up the store credit I have 0.80$ credit and I need to use it in order to change my region, so I can buy more store credit, since my credit card is not from USA anymore I moved back\nI need to find a way to use that amount, do you know any apps? how do I find an app in price order?\n\nA: Since the Apple App Store has standardized price points ($0.99, $1.99, etc), you won't find an app that is $0.80 unfortunately. \nThere isn't any way to search by price in the app store, but services such as AppAdvice.com and others can help a bit.\nMy recommendation is that you choose an app that you want, figure out the price, including tax. Ask a friend in the US to purchase an App Store gift card via the App Store app, in the amount that is the difference between your app of choice, inlcuding tax, less your $0.80. This friend will email you the gift code, which will load into your gift card balance. Purchase your app, and you have zero balance.\nPerhaps even easier: purchase an $0.80 gift certificate for a friend in the US, and email it to them.\n\nA: The normal procedure is to add a valid billing source and buy something that uses all the credit and then do the switch.\nIf for whatever reason, you can't add a valid credit/debit card for your current region, then asking for help from iTunes store support is the best bet.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/support/itunes/contact/\nYou could even ask them if there is a donate to charity option so you felt better about spending some extra $$ to get your balance to zero and thus eligible to make whatever change you want to your purchases going forward.\n", "Q: Open Ports and Network Config Needed For Home Sharing At work, I cannot get home sharing to work with the iOS Remote app to see my Macbook Pro's iTunes instance.

Our IT people said it's not an intentional blocking of the service and would like to help if we can figure out what ports need to be opened to make home sharing work.\n\nA: As mentioned in this Apple support document the following ports have to be open:\nHome Sharing uses TCP port 3689 and UDP port 5353 to communicate with shared iTunes libraries.\nAdditionally port 123 (TCP/UDP) has to be open to set the time automatically. \nThis is a list of all ports for Apple-related protocols, in case there are any remaining issues - Apple KB: TCP and UDP ports used by Apple software products\n", "Q: Spotlight on Yosemite not launching Apps My Yosemite spotlight does not start app anymore. I tend to use it for quickly starting up apps like Terminal, but now it just sort of hangs...\nAny ideas to fix it?\n\nA: It may be indexing or may have a corrupted index.

I have a 7 Mbps connectivity with a download limit of 25GB.  I have been using this for the last 18 months and my usage used to be below 12 GB per month.  The last two months I have been getting huge bills from the ISP claiming that my usage has gone above 40 to 50 GB. There is no change in the usage pattern or even the software deployed in the last many months but the billed usage currently is unexplainable. The router does not have wifi range out side my home where one Mac and two iPhones are only used. The internet usage on the iPhone is also limited to some emails and simple browsing which we have been doing for 18 months.\nNow, sometimes the usage statistics from the tool provided by the ISP shows 700 to 800 MB usage in 20 to 30 minutes even when all my systems are idle.\nHow is it possible for me to plug this hole?\n\nA: The easiest (and cheapest) way is to check the data usage through Activity Monitor. Just type in the name in Spotlight to launch it, and navigate to the Network tab. You can sort by bytes sent/received, though I think you'll have to keep it running to get historical data by app (otherwise shows only total data sent/received). \nFor a complete solution, where you would get prompts for all apps trying to access the internet, and the ability to create filters etc., you can check out Little Snitch 3 (https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html).\n\nA: There are some absolutly free tools you can use to look what is going on.\nUse the Terminal app located in your Utility folder.\nCopy/Paste following:\nsudo lsof -i -n -P | grep TCP \n\nIt will ask for your Password, and show you which apps are using your Internet.\nIf you want to monitor it in real time use\nNetttop in Terminal.

Is there any way to get exercise like weight lifting to count towards the \"move ring\" of the activity app. I realize it will count a small amount just from moving the wrist around, but some days I would like most of my calorie burn to come from weights and the basic app doesn't seem to cover this. \n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure you are using the Workouts app on the watch as this will make the heart rate monitor get your heart rate more often. Therefore, it won't miss any spikes from lifting and moving about.\n\n*Make sure your watch is securely fitted so the heart rate monitor can get an accurate measurement!\n\n*Lastly, it's a bit hard for a device on your watch to know that you are using weight resistance, etc. so don't expect much. Perhaps we'll see some updates from Apple about this, here's hoping!\n\nA: It doesn't seem like the Move ring can be filled with that sort of activity, though it would be nice. However, I don't do any weight lifting myself, but I do remember that just doing what may have been simplified bicep curls close to my body was able to fill it a little, and actually significantly upped the distance I had gone that day, as though the watch thought I was running.\nFor the time being, you're right that you'll have to use third party apps. This may help. It offers a few different options. I didn't read very far down, but it looks like you can use either Gymaholic or Fitlist based on personal preference, though Fitlist seems more popular in the thread.\nRight now, third party apps won't be able to fill the \"Move\" ring. However, with the release of watchOS 2 this fall, you may have more luck. Developers will then be able to access health data on the watch, using sensors such as the heart rate monitor, etc., and creating their own haptic buzzes. I'm not positive that this new openness for developers will cover the Activity app, but it might. Time will tell.\nThere's also this, which again is not guaranteed. You can never quite know with rumors regarding Apple.\nI suppose all of this adds up to say that for now, you'll have to use third party apps and their nonnative services, meaning that the Activity app will not be integrated with your weightlifting. But after a bit of waiting, come fall, you'll almost definitely see a whole bunch of native fitness apps pop up in the App Store, with weightlifting apps likely being among them.\n\nA: Select and run an \"Other\" workout type. When you're done with the workout, choose \"Name Workout\" and then select one of the other activity types such as \"Strength Training\".\nOnce you've done this, \"Strength Training\" will appear as a top-level option for your next workout\n\n\nAt the end of an Other workout, you can choose a name for your workout from a list of options.

I'm particularly physically sensitive to the heat for some reason, and at its hottest it makes me uncomfortable even to just sit at a desk with my hands on it.\nAnyway, I'm in the market for a new laptop, and I'm considering the current 13\" Retina MacBook Pro and 13\" MacBook Air. I'm wondering: Which one runs hotter? (Under light use? Under heavy use? At max heat?)\n\nA: It all depends on your usage (the load).\nFor normal uses (the CPU newer runs at 100% for long times) the MacBook Air would be the colder solution.\nThe MacBook Pro is the more power hungry machine (retina display) and could run hotter.\nOne way to see this is in the Battery life. MacBook Air can go up to 10 hours on a single load.\nYour MBA might need a SMC reset to make sure the Fan control is working correctly. \n\nA: This question seems a bit reversed. All Apple products are designed to let the CPU hit 90°C before the CPU is throttled. So all of them, when given an unlimited workload hit the same design temperature. \nWhat does change is the workload required to saturate the CPU of a MacBook is lower than what will saturate a MacBook Pro. You could just go on the wattage of the CPU to pick a model that doesn't put out so much heat if that's really your main concern. I find most people buy today based on screen size, port counts since ram and CPU and storage are the same for just about all the portable computers. \nAlternatively, adapting to use an iPad Pro would be a good choice if you really want efficiency and limited heat buildup. \nHere are some references for TDP - thermal design power - that translates directly into how hot a processor will run. For MacBook - this correlates pretty directly to how hot the case, machine runs and also how much power it takes to run (battery drain times).\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ark.intel.com/products/88199/Intel-Core-m7-6Y75-Processor-4M-Cache-up-to-3_10-GHz\n\n*https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CPU_power_dissipation_figures\n\n*http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/\n\n*http://ark.intel.com/products/97122/Intel-Core-i7-7700T-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-3_80-GHz\nMacBook is 4 W (burst to 8W) for the most power hungry MacBook in early 2017.\nMacBook Pro is 35 W (burst probably another 15 W for GPU) for the most power hungry MacBook Pro 15\" with GPU in early 2017.\n2016 and older models will run many more watts so check carefully if you aren't buying models that are current in March 2017.\n\nA: It is a truism that the more applications you run, plus the intensity of those applications' operations, will cause a certain amount of heat dissipation in the given device.\nSo assuming that the applications you need will be used regardless, you need to consider the hardware components within each device, since this determines the amount of heat dissipation that will occur.\nAs a general guideline, the higher the quality of the given type of hardware component (i.e., cpu, video card, etc.), the more capable that component will be to perform without having more heat dissipation (than a low-end component trying to do the same amount of work).\nIn other words, a low-end component will work \"harder\" than a high-end component, which causes the low-end component to generate more heat.\n", "Q: Can I use two 4k displays with MacBook Pro MGXA2 According to specs on Apple site it is not possible, but they not always accurate. Have anybody tried this?\n\nA: Multiple (up to 12) thunderbolt displays or devices can be chained and utilised by a single port. Whether your device has the power to do this, and whether the OS allows it is a different matter. Your device should be running Mavericks or Yosemite and should be powerful enough to use the monitors. With most Thunderbolt Displays they can be plugged into the mains and therefore work fine in chains with low powered devices.\n", "Q: Scaling different amounts on each axis in Keynote In Keynote it's easy to build an animation wherein you scale or rotate an item uniformly on horizontal and vertical. But is there a way to scale an object only on the vertical axis?\nThis is on the latest version of Keynote (6.5.3).\n\nA: I don't think you can do it through the usual Actions applied to the object, but you should be able to get what you want using Magic Move.\nGet your slide the way you want it, then duplicate it. \nIn the second copy, scale the object to the new stretched out size (deselect Constrain proportions to stretch the vertical axis). \nThen click back on your first slide and in the Animate tab, choose Magic Move. \nWhen you play your slide and go to the next, it should scale your object to its new vertically stretched size.\n\nA: This question is a bit old, and what the OP wants may not even pertain to this, but there's a simpler trick I use to turn an object around. This assumes the object can be reversed (i.e., a graphic, text box, or shape; a table can't do this):\n\n\n*\n\n*Apply a \"Flip\" to the object's Build Out property.\n\n*Create a reverse version of what you want to flip by...\n\n*Change the Build Out to none\n\n*Change the Build In to \"Flip\"\n\n*Adjust the Build In of the reverse to apply WITH the previous build (the Build Out)\n\n*Make sure the Build Out of the original object and the Build In of the reverse have the same timing or things will get kind of weird.\n\n", "Q: Highlight first Google result in Safari In Safari 8, after doing a Google search from the navbar, the focus stays on the navbar instead of focusing on the content like any other webpage.\nThis prevents the use of Google or DuckDuckGo keyboard shortcuts to open the first result quickly, for instance. You need to click on the page content first, and then you can use the keyboard navigation.\nIs there a solution to make it easier? Extension, shortcut, setting, anything?\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, try OptionTab then down-arrow to the result you want and press return. There will be a tiny arrow to left of the selected link.\n", "Q: SaaS subscription across iOS, Android and Web We have three different forms of distribution for our SaaS (Web, Android and iOS) all currently reviewed and in-store in their free form ($0).\nOur business model is focussed around a single subscription across all platforms and was hoping to use our existing system of Stripe > Webhook to updates all services of a users status.\nHeads down in the development has overlooked the very confusing, constantly changing and expensive (70/30 split!) guidelines that Apple publishes.\nWe've developed blindly as looking at apps like Dropbox and many others offer the same subscription / account across all platforms.\nMy questions is how are they doing it? IAP? External subscription? From the guidelines you are not allowed to link to a 'Buy / Subscribe' button.\n\nA: You're not allowed to link to an external payment method, but saying that the app requires payment outside of the app is fine.\nFor example, mentioning in the app description that the app “requires a valid subscription to x” is acceptable, whereas having a link inside the app to “purchase your subscription here” is not unless that purchase is through IAP.\n", "Q: Pages 5.5.2: How do I remove the light gray line between two columns in a table?

I am still unsure why the text appears differently in the table versus outside the table, despite sharing the same font and size.\n", "Q: Which upgrades to my iMac 2011 will improve performance the most? I have started a job that will require processing of large datasets using python and ArcMap (separately and in conjunction with ArcMap).  I have a 2011 27\" iMac with the 3.1 Mhz i5 (3rd generation I believe) quad core processor, 20 GB of ram, and 1TB 5400 rpm hard drive.  I believe this machine could handle the work load adequately as is, but this is a part-time gig and I want to maximize my efficiency with respect to computing power and impress my employers.  I don't want to buy a new computer right now (maybe in two years or so), for two reasons: 1) funds are currently limited, and 2) I think with the right upgrades, in the right order, with a focus on increasing speed and then storage, I could use this machine for the next 2-3 years.\nWhere should I focus first?  I see the options as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the pair of 2 GB ram modules with a pair of 8 GB ram modules to max out my ram at 32 GB.  \n\n*Add in a secondary hard drive in the form of an SSD, to store applications and important inputs to different processing steps.\n\n*Replace the 1 TB hard drive with a faster and larger regular hard drive.  This limits the need to transfer to/from externals through the USB 2.0 ports.\nObviously all three options could be pursued, but is there some efficient order that gives me the greatest returns up front, allowing me to stop upgrading when the iMac seems solidly up to the task?\n\nA: You are the best person to answer that. \nUse the Activity monitor and take a look at RAM and HD current usage. \nThat will tell you what you need most. Usually the more RAM the better, that in turn also removes some load from the HD, but a fasted SSD could help in the initial step of loading the app in to the RAM.\nSo if you open and close lost of apps and save lots of stuff a faster SSD will help. If you initially open lots of apps, but then just use them, without need to constantly access the HD (SSD) then RAM size matters. See it this way: RAM is the supper fast (temporary) storage between the CPU and the Hard Drive. Without improvement in HD (SSD) the boot up and the shut down will not be faster, but during the normal usage with large RAM you will benefit.\n\nA: If you exceed 20 GB of RAM (I would say also, if you exceed 8 GB of RAM), you're doing something wrong with your code / algorithm. So try to optimize it to achieve better performance and if you can't optimize, go for high parallelism (cloud computing).\nMoreover you can use you HD space as swap space for temporary store information.\nI would opt out for SSD upgrade, and making it the primary drive with OS installed on it (Python interpreter will run on it).\nRAM upgrade and HD upgrade (from 5400 rpm to 7200 rpm or 10000 rpm), in my opinion, are useless. A 10000 rpm hard disk is slower than the low end SSD.\n", "Q: Geolocation on Mac Pro Our Mac Pro is showing our old address as the location. How do we get it to change to new address?\nWe have switched on and off, reset and it still not working.\n\nA: If you moved with your own router and are still connected to it —on the new location— it may be that the database that holds the information about where your particular SSID, MAC or whatever information Apple uses to identify and geolocate network devices that conform it's \"WPS\" has not been updated yet.\nThis answer may be of help:\n\nThe Mac can use Wi-Fi network identification for localization. This is called a Wi-Fi Positioning System (WPS). The access points name and signal strength is determined and looked up in a database to identify the location. The more access points are found, the more precise the localization.\n\nApparently, Apple used a commercial service called \"Skyhook\" where you could send your wifi and location data manually to update their database, but it seems they have their own location service now, which has, according to this answer:\n\nno public facing way to seed their master database.\n\nOn the same answer though, it states that:\n\nwhen you opt in to share anonymous diagnostic information it will occasionally update their database\n\nSo maybe opting in —if you haven't already— will speed up the relocation of your network on Apple's side.\n", "Q: Fan for MacBook Air? Macbook Air gets hot near its processor and gets sluggish for a while, whenever I make \"heavy\" tasks at the same time. I wonder if a fan under its base would make any difference since mac has no ventilation. In any case, would it help at all? \nEdit: I consider the cases when the speed of the internal fan is quite normal but the area near the processor gets hot, since I can understand whenever fan speed is high, producing all that noise (e.g. when installing an OS).\n\nA: It could help if you see kernel_task soaking CPU cycles.\nFrom https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203184\n\nActivity Monitor may show that a process named kernel_task is using a large percentage of your CPU, and during this time you may notice a lot of fan activity. This process helps manage temperature by making the CPU less available to processes that are using the CPU intensely. In other words, kernel_task responds to conditions that cause your CPU to become too hot. When the temperature decreases, kernel_task automatically reduces its activity. \n\nSo if your case is more than 10°F / 5°C warmer than the ambient temperature and you are seeing high CPU/kernel task usage, cooling the bottom case or increasing airflow significantly might actually speed up your Air.\n", "Q: External Hard Drive size I'm using a 13-inch 2013 macbook air with 4gb memory, and after a near disaster with a spilt drink I've realised I need to start backing it up. I don't know what size external hard drive I need though, as I don't want to spend lots of money on something if it's not entirely necessary. Any suggestions? \n\nA: *\n\n*Choose a reputable manufacturer: As data shows, HGST (formerly Hitachi, now owned by Western Digital) makes the most reliable hard-drives on the market today. Stay away from Seagate drives (see comments). \n\n*Choose the right size drive: Regardless of the method, it's highly recommended to purchase an external drive that is atleast twice the capacity of the internal drive it’s backing up. \n\n*Use Time Machine: There is no better local backup method for OS X. Alternatives exist in the form of archives (cloning your drive to another), but this is not a true, continuous backup. \n\n\nSidenote: Networked backups using Apple’s Time Capsule is a reliable, wireless, way that is equally viable and definitely more convenient. The obvious con of this solution is the price-tag.  \nAssuming your internal drive is no bigger than 500GB, here is the drive I would recommend: HGST Touro 1 TB 5400-RPM USB 3.0 External Hard Drive.\n\nUpdates: \n\n\n*\n\n*I own four HGST Touro drives. All have operated extremely well with no mechanical issues or problems to date. This is only my personal experience - which is all the more reason why it’s important to note that the Touro is the top-rated external hard drive on Amazon according to average customer reviews. \n\n*@bmike brought up an important point. The Backblaze study on HDD failure rates used enterprise grade drives of 3.5’’ form factor. The consumer grade 2.5’’ external HDD’s, those relevant to the original question, were not the subject of these tests. See the comments below. \n\n\nA: You will need a drive at least as large as the internal storage of the Mac.\nYou can open About This Mac from the Apple menu at the top left of the screen and then select storage.\nYou probably have between 128 GB and 512 GB of internal storage, so getting a 1 TB drive would be room for double the space of the largest Air storage drive. You could also get away with a 500 GB drive in most cases. I'd say buy whatever size drive is in the middle of the price for the next size up once you select the case and connection you prefer.\nUsually in the US, you can get a feel for when the drive becomes pricey by comparing: http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Portable-Hard-Drive-WDBU6Y0020BBK-NESN/dp/B00DULWSXI\n\n\n*\n\n*500 GB for $52\n\n*1000 GB (1 TB) for $58\n\n*2000 GB (2 TB) for $87\n\n\nThe 3 GB and larger portable drives will be an extra $50 or $100 so I buy right below the big delta price jump. Save $$ if you have modest needs - that 1 TB drive is a lot of storage for the cost.\n\nA: Depending on what sort of backup you want to do: if you want to use TimeMachine the normal rule of thumb is that you choose a size that is 3 times the internal disk size. If you want to do a clone, the same size is enough, but you loose history. I propose to use a disk for TimeMachine as well as a second disk for a clone or another type of backup.\n\nA: I would suggest that you use a portable drive rather than a desktop external drive.\nWith most Portables you will not need to worry about an extra Power supply.\nI would also use TimeMachine with the device.\nBe aware  that TimeMachine will eat all available space on the drive overtime. And overwrite the oldest backups.\nWhich although this is ok I often find I want to back up somethings outside of Time Machine.\nIf you can afford a 2TB drive you can partition it into two MacOS Extended Journaled  Partitions of 1 TB each.\nThis is easly done with the Disk Utility.app already on your Mac.\nYou can then use 1 partition for TimeMachine and the other for non Time Machine Backups or Storage.\nOr split it with the TimeMachine partition using 1.xxx TB and the other partition the remainder space. i.e 1.5TB & 500MB\nBut I would let TimeMachine have a minimum of 1TB.\nIf you go for a 1TB drive then let TimeMachine use it all.\nOthers have suggested WD of HGT drives I agree with this and I have never had a problem with one.\nI have always purchased the WD passport drives. My latest is a 2TB My Passport Ultra (USB 3). This is actually pre-formatted and intended for a PC.\nAnd was cheaper than the ones intended for the Mac. It is a simple matter of reformatting the drive to a Mac one.\nThe PC drives come with a load of software that helps with backups, encryption and drive utilities. For PC and Mac (image shows Mac apps) Before you erase and reformat, copy these all off to you Mac incase you want them at a later date.\nI have never really looked at them passed copying them off but you may find them useful.\n\nDo not use Lacie drives. I have found they will die on you no matter how nice they look.\n\nUpdate.\nIf you do Partition into two drives you should make sure that TimeMachine does not Back it up by using it's exclude options to exclude the second Partition.\n\nA: \nI don't want to spend lots of money on something if it's not entirely necessary. \n\nBackups are necessary, as you have now realized. Drives are readily available for about $100 - is your data worth that much to you? (Drive-recovery services start at $1000)\nThere are now only 3 manufacturers of hard disk drives, and they all make reliable drives. There are, however, hundreds of external-case manufacturers and the quality ranges from (literally) bulletproof to complete junk.\n\nI'm using a 13-inch 2013 macbook air with 4gb memory\n\nThat changes the equation quite a bit. You can plug almost any decent external drive into a desktop, turn on Time Machine, and then forget about it (I have a rack of LaCie D2 drives under the desk). But I expect you move the laptop around quite a bit. If you don't remember to plug in the external, activate the backup and wait for it to finish you probably won't have one when you need it.\nApple already has a solution for you. Get one of the Time Capsule backups / wifi routers, set it up on a shelf, and then forget about it. Your computer will back up automatically, over wifi, whenever it is plugged in. Doesn't even have to be open (it does of course have to be turned on). At $300 it's not cheap, but it does include wifi and it's fully integrated. You're buying convenience here. If you want to spend less you have to do more work.\n", "Q: Connecting Macbook Air to HPw1907 external screen I have recently brought a HPw1907 external screen for my mac but having trouble connecting it. I have connected a VGA cable but as soon as I turn it on, the monitor goes straight to sleep. When I open the display setting, I don't have the 'gather windows' or 'arrangement' setting unless I choose 'apple tv' in the drop down menu but that detects our Apple TV rather than the screen.\nAny tips?\n\nA: Since the the MacBook Air does not have VGA plug I would say\n... your Thunderbolt to VGA converter is not the proper one.\nThat would be also the reason why it does not correctly detect the HP monitor. \nTry the Thunderbolt to DVI adapter instead.\n", "Q: Does Apple specify what the average lifespan of an iMac G5 would be? Based solely on the hardware used (including the power supply, logic board, RAM...) and assuming that the Software will not be updated (remain at OS X Tiger does Apple specify what a reasonable expectation for the lifespan of an iMac G5 from Mid 2005 would be? \nDoes (or has) Apple provided specifications such as these for any of its products?\nI am looking into purchasing one from eBay and want to know if it will last and if I can expect to receive one that is \"fully functional\" even after ten years.\n\nA: No. Apple actually disclaims that a brand new Mac will work reliably. Only that they will repair it, replace it, or refund your purchase if you seek warranty service under the conditions of the one year warranty:\n\nAPPLE DISCLAIMS ALL STATUTORY AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND WARRANTIES AGAINST HIDDEN OR LATENT DEFECTS\n\nAbove from the US hardware warranty page at http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/ for a Mac Pro\nFurthermore, Apple has a long standing policy of cutting off the vast majority of repair service for Macs 5 years from the date when they remove it from sale.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624 - Vintage and obsolete products\n\n\nThere are some exceptions where you can get support between years 5 and 7, but after 7 years, Apple and Apple Authorized Service Centers often flat out deny repair requests due to lack of support or part availability.\nI cannot find any G5 or PPC machine that isn't officially designated by Apple as obsolete in 2015.\nSo - in summary, a new Mac Pro isn't sold with the expectation that it will even work for one year and the expectation that it might need repairs. Certainly second hand older machines won't be vouched for by Apple to have a working life of 10 years from now. That doesn't mean some G5 will run for decades to come, just that the one you buy might or might not be the exception to things wearing out eventually.\n", "Q: Problems updating to OS X Yosemite I am trying to update to OS X Yosemite. It is asking me for an iTunes Store password of a different email address and I can't change it. What should I do?\n\nA: Open the App Store and on the main page, sign out of the currently logged in Apple ID. Sign in with your Apple ID and then try to click upgrade/install on the Yosemite page. \n", "Q: Thunderbolt speed via bootcamp? Thunderbolt is very fast on OS X, but do we get the same speed when accessing Thunderbolt devices through boot camp? Meaning, if I wanted to install Steam games from my Boot Camp partition onto a Thunderbolt drive instead of on the partition itself, would I see any deterioration in quality?\n\nA: Since the Thunderbolt drives can run 10 up to 20 Gbps that is much faster than the internal drive in many cases.\nI do not see a problem, but can not speak for the boot camp it self.\nHere are some numbers:\nSSDs itself will have the same speed of reading and writing no matter the cable. The TYPE of cable/connection decides if it can sustain that speed, and this is equally true with USB 3.0, eSATA (v2/3) and TB1/2 - all of them have wide enough bandwidth to support high-speed transfer rates that SSDs are capable of.\nUSB 3.0 up to 5 Gbits/s (525 MB/s)\neSATA 2 up to 3 Gbits/s (300 MB/s)\neSATA 3 up to 6 Gbits/s (600 MB/s)\nTB1 up to 10 Gbits/s per channel (1050 MB/s)\nTB2 up to 20 Gbits/s aggregated channels (2100 MB/s)\nIn summary, those numbers would say the Boot camp would run as fast or faster via Thunderbolt cable to SSD drive.\n", "Q: Delete iCloud account without removing photos My boyfriend bought me an iPhone 4 a year ago off a friend of a friend and I have since had a baby, so it is full with 700 odd pics which I want to keep safe of my baby boy on iCloud.\nThing is I've went to Settings → iCloud and the guy's iCloud is still logged in. I went to press delete so I could put my Apple ID in but it says it will wipe all pictures/data off the iPhone (obviously don't want to risk losing all my pictures of baby).\nHow do I set up my own iCloud and delete old person's without losing all the pictures?\n\nA: *\n\n*Backup pictures to your computer.\n\n*Log out and log in with your iCloud account.\n\n*Transfer pictures back to your iPhone.\n\n\nA: You have to follow certain things before disconnecting your iCloud account.. \nFirst you need to download some files to the local storage. If you have iWork documents stored on the cloud, then visit the iCloud website from a computer and sign in (link in Resources). \nVisit the \"Pages\" section, select the documents you wish to save and click the Settings icon, which looks like a small gear. Choose \"Download Documents.\" \nRepeat this process with your Keynote and Numbers apps. You don't need to back up photos, because the iCloud Photo Stream feature just displays the last 30 days of photos stored in your local camera roll. \nRemove your old account on iOS devices by returning to the iCloud menu and tapping \"Delete Account.\" \nAcknowledge that your documents and photo stream will be removed from the device by pressing \"Delete.\" When the prompt asks what to do with contacts, calendars, reminders, and Safari information, tap on the \"Keep\" option.

This question is very similar to Is it possible to always show hidden/dotfiles in Open/Save dialogs?. How to show hidden files and folders in finder? is also related. However, I don't want to always show them, and that's what defaults write ... AppleShowAllFiles ... does.\nRather, I want to switch it on when needed. I'm trying to open .bash_profile, so I need it now:\n\nLinux and Gnome allow us to CTRL+H to toggle between showing and hiding hidden files. But Gnome hotkeys don't work on OS X (which is expected).\nFor completeness, .bash_profile does exist in the home directory:\n$ ls ~/.bash_profile \n/Users/jww/.bash_profile\n\n\nA related question... As can be seen above, typing the filename in Finder (or is it Spotlight) search did not work. I tried to right click to get a context menu in the File Open dialog in hopes of checking a box like \"show all files\". And I tried the View menu looking for a \"show all files\" with the File Open dialog open.\nWhy is this hidden away somewhere? What purpose does it serve to not allow a user to easily open a file?\n\nA: ⌘ CMD+⇧ SHIFT+. reveals hidden files in Finder and Open/Save dialogs.\nIf you are using an AZERTY keyboard, you'll need to press fn too, so ⇧ SHIFT is taken into consideration as you already need it to make the ..\n\nYou can also press ⌘ CMD+⇧ SHIFT+G and type the path to the hidden folder, just like in Terminal (⇥ TAB autocompletion also works).\nEditing hidden files can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nA: DISCLAIMER/WARNING \nHidden files are hidden for a reason usually. Use the script below only if you're reasonably sure you know what you're doing. In other words: If you break your system by randomly deleting hidden files, it's your own fault.\n\nHere's the script I use to toggle show/don't show hidden files inside Finder. \n(The OSX native shortcut to toggle hidden files in Open/Save dialogues was mentioned by Mateusz Szlosek above already)\nThe difference between my script and others I've seen so far: \nMost scripts don't do anything else after killing Finder. Usually, this means you have to navigate back to the folder you were in originally, since the automatic Finder relaunch doesn't reliably open your last active folder.\nThe script below instead reopens, and focuses on, your last active folder, i.e. the folder you were in when using the toggle, but now showing (or not showing) hidden files.\nI assigned a shortcut to it (cmd+shift+.) and find working with hidden files in Finder a lot more convenient now.\nCredit to Tetsujin who posted a script on this site a while ago that I adapted to add the 'reopen last folder' functionality.\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set var1 to POSIX path of (target of window 1 as alias)\n    end tell\n    set newHiddenVisiblesState to \"YES\"\n    set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script \"defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles\"\n    if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {\"1\", \"YES\"} then\n        set newHiddenVisiblesState to \"NO\"\n    end if\n    do shell script \"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles \" & newHiddenVisiblesState\n    ---- Sleep hack mentioned below. 0.5s minimum, 1-2s safer. Ugly, but (probably) unavoidable.\n    do shell script \"killall Finder; sleep 0.5s\"\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        ---- Close other windows if Finder managed to relaunch already\n        if application \"Finder\" is running then\n            close every window\n        end if\n        open (var1 as POSIX file)\n        activate\n    end tell\nend run\n\nTo use the script: Open a new workflow in Automator, drag in \"Run AppleScript\", copy&paste the code above, and save inside your services folder (usually, ~/Library/Services/, afaik).\nAttaching a shortcut to execute a script should be covered somewhere else on this site. I limited the scope of my shortcut to Finder alone.\n\nStyle remark:\nI have to resort to a bit of an ugly hack, using 'sleep' after killing Finder, before manually opening the original folder. \nIf I don't force this delay, there's a chance OSX relaunched Finder already and opened a folder (not necessarily the last active one, in my experience). Together with my own 'open' command, this can lead to the nasty effect of two (unkillable, even) Finder processes running, and Finder not working anymore at all. If this happens, logging out and back in again fixes it, but it's a waste of time obviously, so I use 'sleep'. \nA sleep value of 0.5s works for me, but to be on the safe side, you can slightly increase it (adding a more noticeable delay to the process then).\nIf someone knows of a way to either suppress the Finder relaunch and unreliable opening of some window after sending the killall signal -- or some other way to get rid of the 'sleep' hack -- I'd be happy to hear it!\n\nA: Mateusz Szlosek covered the first part. Below is how I have handled the second part for my own use.\nIn my haste to post my answer, I did not realize the second part has already has been answered. See How to set ⌘ + H to enable show hidden files. What I offer below differs by a dialog informing you of the current status. \nI created a service using the Automator application. When I want to toggle the viewing of hidden files, I select \"Toggle Hidden Files\" from the Finder services submenu as shown below. (Hint: Click image for a better view.)\n\nThis will cause either pop shown below to appear.\n\n\nThe steps to create the service are give below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Automator, select a new document of type Service.\n\n*Drag the action \"Run Shell Script\" to the workflow pane.\n\n*Edit the contains to appear as shown below.

The iPad display is 9.7″ diagonally. Why is it not a rounded value such as 10″? Are these display sizes magically invented?\n\nA: A screen is manufactured at x pixels * y pixels, probably measured in microns or nanometres, which will give a final measurement for x * pixels and y * pixels in millimetres.\nPythagoras figured out that the diagonal measurement of a right-angled triangle [the hypotenuse] is the square root of the sum of the squares of the other two sides…. again this would nominally be in millimetres.\nThen someone has to figure out what that is when converted back to the creakily aging Imperial measurement system still used in the USA & others [UK too]\nThe end result is very unlikely to come out to a round number of inches.\n", "Q: How much space do I need for an iPad for iOS programming? What is a good storage space for an iPad for iOS programming? Should I purchase a 16 GB model or a 32 GB model? Would 16 GB be to small for iPad and iOS programming?\n\nA: You need as much space as your app requires to be installed, which depends entirely on the type of apps you are developing and the number of apps that you intend to install at one time.\niOS uses at most approximately 4 GB, leaving 12 GB on the 16 GB model. The largest apps on the App Store are rarely larger than a couple of gigabytes, so this would be fine for that.\n", "Q: How do I depend on a specific version of a homebrew formula I'm having a conflict with a formula and a particular version of Boost. Ideally, since this is really just a build conflict (it's not using a Boost shared library), I'd like to automatically use a specific version when building. I doubt this is possible, so I'd really just be happy with it as a conflict or as dependency, but I can't find documentation for that. What I found is the generic dependency example:\nclass Foo < Formula\n  depends_on \"boost\" => \"with-icu\"\nend\n\nIs this even something I can do?\n\nA: Homebrew is still improving their support for depending on old versions of a library, with some planned improvements in this issue. In the meantime, you can use the homebrew/versions tap, which has formulae for boost 1.55 and boost 1.59. To depend on these versioned formulae, you could use the following:\ndepends_on \"homebrew/versions/boost155\"\n\nor\ndepends_on \"homebrew/versions/boost159\"\n\nEDIT:\nYou mentioned lack of documentation about conflicts. There is a conflicts_with keyword, but that is more about conflicts with being installed side-by-side. There's also a fails_with keyword, but that is related to specific versions of compilers. I think using depends_on with a formula from homebrew/versions will work best for you.\n", "Q: Why does Apple Watch keep installing apps I didn't ask it to? The iOS Apple Watch app has a setting (General > Automatic Download > Automatically Download Apps) that is described as follows \n\nWhen this is on and you have apps on your iPhone that also work with\n  Apple Watch, those apps will automatically download and appear on your\n  watch home screen.\n\n\nBut whenever an iOS app on my phone is updated to include Apple Watch support, it gets added to my Watch, even when this setting is off. \nHow do I prevent newly Watch-enabled apps from downloading themselves?\n\nA: That setting is not working.\nThis is Apple's Bug.\nI confirmed with Apple support.\nLatest watch os 1.0.1 still Buggy.\n\nA: As temp mentioned, there was previously a bug preventing this feature from working properly.\nI can confirm that Apple has fixed this bug, as the issue is not present in Watch OS 3.0.\n", "Q: Some aliases return 'No mapping found' After editing .bash_profile, .bashrc, .inputrc\ndotfile config my aliases went silly.\nSome aliases work as expected.\nOthers for no apparent reason return:\nNo mapping found\nPress ENTER or type command to continue\n\nbash GNU bash, version 3.2.57, Yosemite 10.10.3, iterm2\n\nA: The problem was not with aliases but with vim maps.\nA satisfactory answer can be found here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/15214794/no-mapping-found\n", "Q: What are \"Active Calories\"? The Apple Watch Activity app purports to measure what it calls \"Active Calories\" which it counts towards its \"Move\" goal. But Apple's definition of such calories is clearly its own, not counting (at least apparently), for example, calories from weight workouts, Pilates, or yoga or 7-minute workouts?\nWhat is the (Apple) definition of \"Active Calories\"? What does one have to do to generate them?\n\nA: Apple doesn't define active calories in the manual for Apple Watch, but they are a common measurement in sports physiology.\nIf you are in a coma, your body uses up calories from two of the three muscle types: smooth and cardiac muscle. The third type is skeletal muscle and that's what Active Calories tries to estimate using a physiological model that clearly considers average human statistics and then incorporates input data you feed Apple's Health App (height, weight, sex, heart rate) and then uses the accelerometer to pick apart your specific activity level for input to the model. \nPresumably a large amount of PHD level research went into Apple's internal algorithms and models based on who they hired to work on the fitness teams in several internal laboratories.\nSince you mentioned some sports, here are my thoughts:\nThe watch can't know about what weights you are lifting since it doesn't have sensors for that (yet). In fact, the algorithms may mess up since it's seeing your wrist move slowly yet your heart rate goes up much more than it might expect/anticipate. Active calories will be far more accurate for people that run, walk and move without machines or weights attached to their bodies. So pilates (non-reformer), yoga, and 7 minute workouts without weights will be more accurately reflected in Active Calories than will reformer pilates and weight lifting.\nHopefully, weight machines or extra data input can arrive some time later for people to get excellent results with weights. I could see non-free weight machines interface with an app or health kit directly to enhance the recording of your workout profile and progress. Also, indirectly your heart rate will reflect your weight lifting, so without needing specific input, the active calorie measure should still be useful in an absolute measure and highly useful for comparing one workout to another as you add weights and change your metabolic response to physical stress.\n\nA: Using a heart rate monitor like the polar Bluetooth model makes the difference. The heart rate monitor on the watch by itself is let accurate enough, but with the strap it's pretty spot on. \n", "Q: Testing an iPhone 5C without a battery or screen I have a previously broken iPhone 5c that I removed the offending parts from. The screen was shattered beyond repair, and the battery was in pretty bad condition. I'm planning to buy some new parts and repair it, but I don't want to spend around $100 and find out that other parts are broken and it's non-salvageable. \nIs there a way to test the phone, maybe by making it ring or vibrate, without a battery or a screen? \nUpdate: It works, it's charging and vibrating, but it seems to be trying to notify me of something important, as it is vibrating every 3 seconds. is this normal or what\n\nA: I think on iPhones the 3 second vibratíon indicates a screen problem\n", "Q: Images from PDF to presentation: low quality I have a PDF that has some embedded images, and for some reason I'm not able to extract them with wondershare PDF editor (they're not even seen as images). So I tried to make a screenshot with cmd+alt+4 but the captured images have a too low quality, specially when I insert them into a powerpoint presentation. This is how they are seen in the PDF:  \nAnd this is how they appear in the presentation: \nI don't know if you can see the difference, but it's clearer when I run the presentation on my macbook. The problem is that I don't find a way to directly extract the images, so I'm looking for an alternative solution, something like a high-quality screenshot or another way to extract images from the PDF.\n\nA: Preview app on 10.6.8 doesn't let you extract images except by selecting then copying and creating a new file from clipboard.\nAnother way is using the free unix xpdf tools. They come with a utility called pdfimages. I just used it on a PDF and it perfectly extracted the images from the file.\nFor example...\npdfimages -f 2 -l 2 -j 27487.pdf testname\nIt extracted the images starting (-f) and ending (-l) on page 2 and saved as JPG.\nxpdf is available from HomeBrew.\nHTH \n\nA: Extract images and graphics directly with a free app: The Unarchiver (App Store) ; The Unarchiver is mostly used/known for compressing and uncompressing files.\nJust right-click and Open With > The Unarchiver.app\nOr simply drag the file directly to The Unarchiver\n\nWorks fine with pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pot, pps, pptx, and others.\n", "Q: Backups seeming much much larger than my hard drive Can anyone explain this to me? My drive clearly does not have 140TB of backups on it...\n\nthis is on a late 2013 retina macbook pro 13 inch.\n\nA: It's a glitch in Time Machine. When an auto-backup is scheduled but your external hard drive isn't available, the computer saves a backup locally. I'm not exactly sure how their space-counting function manages to mess up like this, I'm just paraphrasing what I read in a Google result that then proceeded to give me the solution that worked for me.\nThe solution: Go into System Preferences > Time Machine, and flip the switch from on to off.

The problem does not occur over Wifi, but my LTE/3G connection is perfectly reliable for non-Google apps (streaming video with Netflix works great).\nI tried the following to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstalled every Google app from my phone\n\n*Cleared the iCloud backups for all of them\n\n*Installed Gmail app.  It prompted me to sign into my account (not sure how it prepopulated my account after being uninstalled), but could not connect to the network.  I removed the account from the Gmail app, uninstalled, reinstalled, and still no network.\n\n*Turned on wifi to verify that the app was able to connect.  It was, instantly.  Turned off wifi and reloaded the app - no connection.  Verified good LTE connection in other apps.\n\n\nRestarting the phone fixes the issue and the Google apps work over LTE/3G again, but the problem recurs every couple days, and the only solution is to turn the phone off and on.\nAny ideas?  The fact that the problem persists across uninstallations and is only solved by a reboot of the phone seems to indicate a problem with the iPhone rather than Google apps, but the fact that the problem is isolated to Google apps would indicate otherwise.  I'd take it to the Apple store, but I have a feeling they'd just tell me to contact Google.\nUpdate\nWhen the issue is occurring, I can access google.com via Safari and via Ping Analyzer.\n\nA: Tetsujin's answer helped me, although my problem wasn't exactly the same as his.

Personally I would find this very useful after a paragraph is completed and before the new paragraph starts - or perhaps there is already a way to get the program to distinguish between end of paragraph and end of sentence?\n\nA: Use the following  after the word to tell your mac to take a break for 1000 milliseconds after that word:\n\n[[slnc 1000]]\n\n\"The silence command causes the synthesizer to generate silence for the specified number of milliseconds. You might want to insert extra silence between two sentences to allow listeners to fully absorb the meaning of the first one. Note that the precise timing of the silence will vary among synthesizers.\"\nYou can change the number of milliseconds.\nHopes this answers your question.\nMore information on https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/SpeechSynthesisProgrammingGuide/FineTuning/FineTuning.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004365-CH5-SW11\n", "Q: Kernel panics too often OS X 10.10.3 I'm getting kernel panics more often than I'm comfortable with.

troubleshoot this panic:\n\n\n*\n\n*You’ve disabled OSX’s native memory compression using low level sysctl parameters: “Boot args: vm_compressor=2”. Clear that boot argument according to the command below, then test:\nsudo nvram -d boot-args\n\n*Rule out third party software: The most common cause of kernel panics are third party kernel extensions which are either deprecated or incompatible with your OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up in Safe Mode, which loads only native drivers. If you cannot reproduce the panic (note - must be reproducible), then the culprit is most likely third party software. Likewise, if the panic still persists, then software isn’t the issue (and you can skip uninstallation instructions in the following paragraph). \n\n*Boot up normally and proceed to uninstall the software associated with these drivers according to the developer's instructions - in descending order as appearing in the panic report:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.adguard.nfext\n\n*com.globaldelight.driver.BoomDevice\n\n\n*You can verify removal using a simple Terminal command. There should be no output: kextstat | grep -v apple\n\n\n*Without third party drivers, a kernel panic can only be caused by a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*A peripheral device: Disconnect any external drives, I/O devices, hubs, etc, to rule this out.\n\n*A bad OSX image or bug in OS X itself: Reinstall OS X to rule out a bad image. \n\n*A hardware problem: In terms of hardware, faulty RAM modules are often to blame. A repeated error code of type 14 (a page fault) is an indication of such. Run the Apple Hardware test (or Apple Diagnostics) and see if an error code is produced. Both the RAM modules and certain logic board components are tested, but it’s still notoriously a test prone to false negatives. \n\n*If you get to this point, I suggest bringing your machine into Apple and have them run in house diagnostics for a definitive diagnosis.\n\nA: I read following as possible trouble makers:\n\n\n*\n\n*globaldelight app\nUninstall the Boom app and test kernel panics without it.\n\n*AdGuard App \nRemove it and test without it.\nTo take a closer look at what processes died in the last 7 days use this Terminal command:\nps aux | grep -w Z\n\nIt will show you the list of processes that died.\n\nA: I am 98% certain it is a bug in OS X Yosemite, introduced with the 10.10.3 update. Welcome aboard. The kernel panics are totally erratic, some users have also graphics glitches. The only common feature is having a Intel HD 4000 GPU.\nOn MacBook Pros with dual GPU you can avoid the problem by disabling Automatic Graphics Switching (System Preferences > Energy Saver). \nAfter countless phone calls with Apple, I will take my Mac to the Apple Store tomorrow. I am sure they won't find a thing. Then they will keep my Mac for five days, replace the logic board and the issue will persist. Please proof me wrong Apple...\nPlease contribute to the thread in the apple discussion forum and file a bug report (with link to the thread). \n", "Q: iOS 7 I want iOS 8 latest version When I click on software update the little working icon shows up and all it does is spin and spin like it's working but the software latest version never pops up so that I can download and install.

I bought a brand new mac mini, took it home, and did nothing but create a user account. When I try to connect to my network (Comcast Xfinity), I continuously get a \"connection timeout\" error before it even authenticates my password. The same thing always pops up when I try to connect to ANY network around me, even using my phone as a wireless hotspot. However, another MacBook Pro, iPhone 6, Lumia 920 (Windows Phone), and Surface Pro 3 in this apartment are able to connect without ANY issues whatsoever, so it is definitely isolated to my mac mini.\nI took it into the apple store today, and they decided that it would be easiest to just give me a new mac mini.

I set it to \"Automatic\" and it worked fine.\n\nA: I found on another site and thought I would share because this was a pain in the &%&$#.  I tried all the suggestions and then I found one answer that worked IMMEDIATELY and it's so simple.  I have 2 external hard rives connected to my mac mini and it seems they were somehow interfering with the wifi and bluetooth signals.  All I had to do was move them about 6 inches away from the mac mini.  DONE!     At first I just removed them to test but then was able to just make sure they were not right next to the Mac Mini.\n", "Q: How to disable \"always on\" USB power on Macbook Pro I am operating my MacBook Pro early 2015 within a Henge dock (HD03VA13MBPR) , connected to two external displays and external speakers. Both displays and speakers get power from a power distributer that offers a switch via USB. Whenever the USB has power, the monitors stay on. Take off USB power, and the displays shut down.\nNow, that setup worked perfectly on my other computer, where USB Power could be configured. On my new powerbook the displays stay on. The USB Port seems to be \"always on\" during sleep mode.\nHow can I disable the \"always on\" function of the USB port while the MacBook is in sleep mode?\n\nA: This seems not to be possible. I solved the situation now with the help of my dell external displyay. The USB-Hub there can be configured to shut down as soon as the display ist switched off. So the second display and the active speakers are connected to the power plug that can be switched off/on by USB power. This will allow with the klick of one button to switch all other devices off/on.\n", "Q: iTunes totally unresponsive.

I was doing it from the terminal, and this was likely the error you ran in to:\nError: -69847: Couldn't create temporary file\nUnderlying error: 1: POSIX reports: Operation not permitted\n\nAs @Tetsujin mentioned, there is a solution in this question — though, in this case, I think the easiest solution is to run the operation via the command line, with sudo. From a terminal window, you should be able to do:\nsudo diskutil secureErase freespace 0 \"/Volumes/[Disk Name]\"\n\nThis isn't the accepted answer in the linked issue, but it's one of the answers...and way easier than all the other solutions.\nThe 0 in the command specifies that you want to overwrite the free space with zeros...there are other \"more secure\" options, although there are arguments that erasing free space may not be necessary at all, when you have a solid state hard drive.\n", "Q: Boot Camp does not boot after disk cloning I've got a MacBook5,1, and I replaced the CD drive with a SSD. Then, I made a \"DIY fusion drive\". Before doing it, I was using the regular setup, with Boot Camp. Then I put the SSD and made the Fusion drive, and restore a Time Machine backup, so I didn't modify the wWindows partition. I was using that for more than a year.\nLast week my \"regular\" HD started to fail (remember, it has a small partition for Windows and a big one as Macintosh HD), so I bought a new one with the same size of 1 TB.\nI put both disks on sata connectors inside a desktop computer and i cloned it with acronis true image. Against all odds and after 5 hours, i put the new drive inside the macbook, and after 15 minutes filling the bar (I guess it was repairing something caused by the malfunctioning old HD), it finally booted. And it works perfectly, now I'm using it. \nBut today I realised that I can not boot on Windows. The partition is still there, but I can not boot when pressing option key on the startup. I can remember something about a maximum of 4 partitions in the disk due to MBR limits (or is it GPT? actually I never remember which are one or the other...), that's the reason why I think I haven't got a recovery partition. But now the disk have 5 partitions, and one of them which is new to me: the \"Microsoft reserved\".\nIs there any way to recover it without losing Windows data? I was reading a post about something similar in this forum, but that guy hadn't got the DIY FD, and anyway I could't install gptfdisk because of a popt.h missing error…\nMaybe this is useful:\ndiskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         127.7 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1\n   1:         Microsoft Reserved                         134.2 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s2\n   3:          Apple_CoreStorage                         897.0 GB   disk1s3\n   4:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk1s4\n   5:       Microsoft Basic Data Windows HD              102.0 GB   disk1s5\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh FD           *1.0 TB     disk2\n                                 Logical Volume on disk0s2, disk1s3\n                                 CF615BFD-DE74-4DB6-9048-DDD0C370D6DB\n                                 Unencrypted Fusion Drive\n\nAnswer @davidanderson:\nI did the copy using Acronis for Windows.\nsh-3.2# mount\n/dev/disk2 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\nmap -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)\nmap auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk1s5 on /Volumes/Windows HD (fusefs_txantfs, local, synchronous)\nlocalhost:/zzw3xSzLWDmPOMfw7vG9UG on /Volumes/MobileBackups (mtmfs, nosuid, read-only, nobrowse)\nsh-3.2# sudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk1\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         PMBR\n           1           1         Pri GPT header\n           2          32         Pri GPT table\n          34      262144      1  GPT part -

If Windows still will not boot, let me know and we can try to fix the second problem.\nExpanation\nThere are two partition schemes that are important here. They are the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme and the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) partitioning scheme. The MBR scheme contains a MBR Partition Table which allows for the definition of only 4 partitions. The GUID scheme contains the same 4 entry MBR Partition Table and a GUID Partition Table (GPT) whose length is determined at time of creation. This value is typically much larger than 4 entries.\nWhen a disk is partitioned using the GUID scheme, only the first entry is used in the MBR table. On your, disk this table contained the following data.\nDisk: /dev/disk1    geometry: 121601/255/63 [1953525168 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE    0   0   2 - 1023 254  63 [         1 - 1953525167] <Unknown ID>\n 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n\nThe id of EE indicates the disk is GUID partitioned and the GPT should be used to determine partitioning. The next six columes (Starting/Ending cyl/hd/sec) exist for legacy purposes. Experience has taught me that on Mac computers, it does not matter what values are in these six columns. In your case, the first three contain the lowest possible valid values and the next three contain the highest possible valid values. What is important is the start and size columns. Your disk is divided into 1953525168 sectors where each sector is 512 bytes. The first sector is numbered 0 and contains the MBR which also contains the MBR table. The partition with the EE id is defined to cover the rest of the disk. This gives older legacy partitioning software the impression all space has been allocated on the disk. This is why you will see the phrase Protective Master Boot Record (PMBR) in other documentation. \nBelow is a partial list of the contents of the GPT on your disk.\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         PMBR\n           1           1         Pri GPT header\n           2          32         Pri GPT table\n          34      262144      1  GPT part - E3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE\n      262178        2014         \n      264192      409600      2  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n      673792  1751953408      3  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  1752627200     1269760      4  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  1753896960      409600         \n  1754306560   199217152      5  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7\n  1953523712        1423         \n  1953525135          32         Sec GPT table\n  1953525167           1         Sec GPT header\n\nEach table entry is 128 bytes long. Since the table occupies 32 sectors, one can compute the table can hold around 32 * 512 / 128 = 128 entries. (Actually, 128 is the default according to the man page documentation.) Note, there is a backup table/header at the end of the disk. The GUID's correspond to the following types of partitions. \nE3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE = Microsoft Reserved             \nC12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B = EFI \n53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC = Apple_CoreStorage   \n426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC = Apple_Boot\nEBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 = Microsoft Basic Data \n\nNormally, the Disk Utility application hides the EFI and Apple_Boot partitions. The Microsoft Reserved partition does not belong and should be removed. The EFI partition usually occurs first. It is not used to boot the OS X operating system, but is required by OS X for other uses. The Apple_CoreStorage partition contains most of your OS X \"Macintosh FD\" volume. The Apple_Boot partition (I believe) contains your \"Bootable Recovery Partition\". The software, contained in this partition, is the replacement for the recovery software that was on the installation DVD. Finally, Microsoft Basic Data partition contains your Windows volume.\nOn your Mac, Windows requires a MBR scheme which is a conflict since OS X uses a GUID scheme. The following changes were necessary to the MBR partition table to fool Windows in to thinking your computer is using a MBR scheme.\n\n\n*\n\n*The size of the EE partition was adjust to just cover the EFI\npartition.\n\n*Data was copied from the GPT to the MBR partition table. The was\ndone for first three partitions that followed the EFI partition.\nIn your case, this was the rest of the partitions. The start and\nsize were copied exactly. Each GUID was translated to an id. I would\ngive a translation table, but unfortunately not all the translations\nare one-to-one.\n\n*The windows partition was marked as active. Active means boot to\nthis partition. When printing the MBR partition table, the active\npartition is marked with an * character.\n\n\nWhen corrected the MBR partition table should appear as follows.\nDisk: /dev/disk1    geometry: 121601/255/63 [1953525168 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE    0   0   2 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     673791] <Unknown ID>\n 2: AC 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    673792 - 1751953408] <Unknown ID>      \n 3: AB 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [1752627200 -    1269760] Darwin Boot     \n*4: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [1754306560 -  199217152] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n\nThe command that was used to make the changes to this table on your disk is called fdisk. The values for the Starting/Ending cyl/hd/sec where chosen by the command. Other than flagging partition 4 as active, the script you ran only entered the id, start and size values.\nTo be more precise, the exact command was sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk1. The interactive commands were edit, flag and quit. A description of fdisk can be found at this OS X Man Page. (Or by typing man fdisk in a Terminal window.)\n", "Q: Is my MacBook Pro Retina fan failing? My MacBook Pro Retina 15\" (Mid 2012) has what sounds like a failing sound. I've uploaded a recording to Dropbox however it's hard to hear.\nThe best I can describe the sound is that it sounds as if the fan is vibrating more then usual. There's a sort of buzz coming from it.\nI know the best bet is to take the laptop to an Apple shop, but the closest one to me is an hour away, so wanted to make sure. Also, it still is under warranty, but without hearing the noise, what other tests can be done to check if it functions properly?\n(Also, the battery needs replacing, which was confirmed by the Apple Store. When that is done, are the same fans put back in? I'm not sure what's glued to what inside).\n\nA: If they are replacing the battery and it is under warranty, just tell them the fan is buzzing and they will look at it while replacing the battery. It may just be something got in there and it's clanking around which could be solved by compressed air, but it could be failing. \n\nA: Have to tried installing SMC Fan Control? \nYou can look at fan speeds and alter the speeds as well, which would help you verify their functionality/status. \n", "Q: How to upload my iMovie project to iCloud drive?

I have a MacBook Pro which I use Time Machine to back up usually weekly. Its hard drive broke recently.  I got an exactly same hard drive and installed it into the laptop.  How do I restore the computer into the most recent state using the Time Machine backup which was made when the old hard drive was installed?\nIs there a better way to achieve the recovery than what I'm planning to do here?\n\nA: The basic TimeMachine recovery procedure boils down to:\n1) boot from Recovery/Installation media\n2) make use of the Disk Utility (I recall under the tools menu option of the installation USB/DVDs) to format/partition the new disk\n3) Then select/choose the Restore/transfer option where you can then select the TimeMachine (Or Migration Assistant) to restore from.\nThe problems I don't have an answer to as I've never done that in my setups:\na) recovery of the Recovery partition... I usually were doing \"upgrades\", thus I did fresh installs, and then I restored the TimeMachine specific files, or I used the \"Migration Assistant\" to restore the applications/users as need be\nb) You didn't specify the version, which might mean different issues w.r.t. the medium, ie. USB/DVD/etc. Creating a USB boot image is outside the scope of this question and answer ;)\n", "Q: Install OS X replacing Windows on a Mac without losing data My brother installed Windows 7 on my Mac. Now I am trying to install OS X Lion  but when I select Reinstall OS X, I am not able to select any drive. One of my drive has 1.27 TB of data. Is it possible to install OS X without losing data?\n\nA: There is no way to reinstall OS X without formatting and losing data. If you want to keep your data, recover the data to another drive or to the cloud.\n\nA: On windows create second partition formatted as ExFAT. Move data you need to second partition. Then run OS X Recovery Partition. Format first partition, install OS X. Then move data from second partition to first and delete second partition.\n", "Q: What do I need to do to get my Apple Watch apps to launch quickly? Apple describes its Watch as being \"ideal for quick looks and fast interactions\", but most (in fact almost all) of third party Apple Watch app Dark Sky take 20-40 seconds to launch — during which time I could have removed my phone from my pocket and launched the corresponding iOS app.\nIs there something I need to do to get this app to launch faster than I could launch it myself on my iPhone?\n\nA: The biggest thing you can do is delete all the apps except the few you want to be “fast”. Then benchmark and only add others till your performance is acceptable. Be sure to power off your watch, then try launching apps a couple times to get the stable time and not first launch time. \n\nAll third party apps on the Watch currently are going to be slower than grabbing the iPhone, unless you can't get at the phone due to social constraints or it being inaccessible in a bag or pocket or some distance from you and the watch.\nThis is because Apple has made every effort to let no code run on the watch at release. Third party apps get to run nothing on the watch. They don't get access to the digital crown, force touch, regular touch, sensor data or the speaker/microphone directly.\nThey only pre-load some potential answers and pictures (think flash cards and a small photo album) and all the work gets done on the iPhone OS. If you want an answer quickly, get your phone out and access the apps there directly. That saves the Watch from constructing a network connection to the phone, waking it up if needed, activating the app in the background and then telling the app what to do so that the phone app can then tell the watch what images / text to display. If those assets are not pre-loaded on the watch, you then have to wait for them to transfer.\nThe watch will be faster than the phone only when the phone can push events to the watch on its own behalf. For Dark Sky - perhaps you have a severe weather alert that the phone detects in the background or due to a push notification from the Dark Sky servers to the phone using APNS. Then the phone knows there is a watch and pushes a notification to it. You'll get that notification on the watch before you can pull out your phone.\nWorse, most of the apps that are shipping are programmed only in the Xcode simulator and not by developers that have used the watch. A select few developers had the chance to tweak their app with pre-release watches and in the past few weeks with hardware, but most apps just can't be great yet.\nIt's like reading a book about how to learn to ride a bike and then playing with a bike riding simulator. Developers need to go out and ride their bikes and crash, skin their knees, crash some more before they know how to actually ride that new bike.\nHere are some developer perspectives explaining this in more detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Apple Watch app probably sucks\n\n*Overcast Apple Watch app redesign\nThe two apple watch apps I was involved in were not shipped. After evaluating the risk of shipping a smiling , we decided the benefit of being \"First\" wasn't worth the high chance of wasting our time and our user's time until we actually know if the app would be useful.\n", "Q: Deleted emails going to junk folder When I delete a message in my iPad mail inbox, it often gets moved to the junk folder instead of the trash folder. I can't find a pattern related to the sender. Often it will be a message from someone with whom I've emailed hundreds of times. Any ideas?\n\nA: With IMAP, it is the device (or clients) responsibility to know which folder to put various messages in as actions are performed on messages. I suspect you have an IMAP misconfiguration. There are 4 special folders: Drafts, Sent, Deleted and Archive.  These can be specified for each mailbox on each device that accesses that account.  (Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calenders > (pick your account) >  (pick it again) > Advanced Settings)\nTo complicate matters you will have to check each device that you have the mail account configured on.  For Example, if it's configured on a MB, iPhone and iPad then check the special folder designations on all 3.   If you are having this problem intermittently that fact suggest these folders are set correctly on one device, but not another.  If you only have this account on one device, the error in setup will still be in this area of settings.\n", "Q: How to delete an app from iTunes Is it possible to delete an app from my Apple account; (not from my phone, from my apple account)?\n\nA: No, once you've downloaded a paid or free app, it is registered as bought on that account.\n\nA: Once bought, you cannot 'remove' it from your account. However, you can hide it from view by clicking the 'x' which appears on hovering the mouse above the app (in win/Mac). It cannot, however, be done individually from an iDevice.\n\nA: When you download an app, wether it's paid or not, it's called purchasing an app, and when you do that, the app will be \"signed\" with your Apple ID, after that, there's no backward step, you can't undo that. Although you can hide it as sohith said. That's it. Good Luck! :) \n\nA: Go to App Store click on Purchased -> Not on this iPad/iPhone.  Slide the app you want to hide to the left then click Hide (that's in red).\n", "Q: Sudden input device hang and automatic reboot after closing the lid MBP (mid 2014 model), Mac OS X 10.10.3.

This is similar to how you can \"tab complete\" file and folder names in the shell.

I'm a long time Android user and have several magazine subscriptions on Google Play Newsstand.\nI have a new iPad and installed the Google Play Newsstand App, expecting to be able to read my magazines. But to my dismay, the iOS app does not support \"magazines\"!!?\nThe only way I've found so far to read the magazines is via the Google Play website in the Chrome browser (as I would do on my desktop PC), however, the experience on iOS is not good (and inconvenient)! (The text is too small and \"zoom\" does not work properly, full screen mode does not work, does not remember page, \"breaks\" if left open in a tab for a period of time (maybe the \"session\" closes?), etc.)\nSo, is there a better way to read my Google Play Magazines on iPad iOS 8?\n\nA: Recent update to the Google Play Newsstand App (Version 3.2 - 14 July 2015) has added \"Magazine support\"!\nThe experience is pretty much identical to the Android version.\n", "Q: Sizzling Sound on Yosemite in Multi-Output (Aggregate Device) from the 2. Device I recently wanted to play my music through multiple output devices at once: \n\n\n*\n\n*My Macbook Pro's internal speakers\n\n*Bluetooth Speakers\n\n\nAs i have found from the internet i have created a Multi-Output Device through Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup, and it works. The problem is, the 2nd device (not the one which is selected as master device) gives a sizzling sound, which is independent of the source. So, when I select the Built-in Output as master, the bluetooth speaker sizzles, and when I select the bluetooth speaker, my built-in speaker.\nDoes anyone have this problem? \n\nA: Try making sure that your source format (Hz) and bitrate are set to the same on both devices.  My guess is that if they are different, you may have one receiving information at one rate but transmitting as another.  \n", "Q: How to manually add an artwork to the iTunes Artwork directory? I would like to add an artwork to an album which has files saved in .wav format. I know that it is not possible to attach an artwork to a wave file, so I'm trying to add a standalone artwork.jpg file to the album in iTunes.\nI found out that:\n\n*\n\n*it is not possible to attach an artwork to a track or an album directly\n\n*placing an artwork.jpg file in the album's directory doesn't work.\n\n*I learnt from other sources like this that there iTunes saves artworks somewhere in the Album Artwork folder (probably here: /Users/user/Music/iTunes/Album\\ Artwork).\n\nMy questions are:\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to add an artwork manually somewhere in that Album Artwork folder?\n\n*Is there any other hacky way to make iTunes actually load an artwork to an album in .wav format?\n\nNote: The album is not available on the iTunes store, so the album hasn't got the official artwork which could be downloaded by iTunes on its own.\n\nNote 2: the traditional way of adding an artwork using Get info does not work for .wav files.\n\nMajor update:\nIt turns out that it is possible to add an artwork to any album in iTunes. The format doesn't matter.\nThere is one more problem however: it is not possible to add an artwork to an album which has only one track.\nIs there a way around it?\n\nA: Just find the track [or the entire album] in iTunes, select it then hit  Cmd ⌘   i  to get info.\nSelect the Artwork tab then drag your picture from Finder into there.\nUnfortunately, this appears to work for just about any format except WAV.\nThis also applies to an overall 'album' artwork added to the folder rather than files. It will only work if they are not all WAVs.  \nI'd suggest perhaps converting to AIF, which would be a completely lossless conversion.\n\nA: I do that all the time..\nWav. / Aiff. file - Get info. \nOpen the .jpeg file\nCopy Command+C and Paste Command+P into the artwork.\n\nWorks great! \n\nA: In my case it was an mp4 file. So, i pressed right mouse on the file in Itunes, and selected to Create ACC version. After this, I deleted the mp4 file. Then, I could right mouse, get info, and manually add my artwork.\n\nA: Here's what I did, since while most of my iTunes albums are recorded as high-quality VBR .mp3's, there are some albums I want to copy as .wav in order to maintain the CD quality while listening through a good sound system.\nI go to the last track on the album, right-click on it and select \"Create .mp3 version.\" Once that's done, I right-click on the newly created .mp3 version and add the artwork there as normal. It's now applied to the whole album in iTunes (but will only show up on your iPod or iPhone when playing the single .mp3 file unfortunately.)\nAnnoying that you have to perform this work-around, but it does at least clean up any missing artwork in iTunes itself. Note you have to keep the spare .mp3 file in the album after adding the artwork, otherwise the apple nazis will once again force removal of the artwork. Sigh.\nHTH.\n", "Q: How does Apple Watch backup work? Does the Apple Watch use the same mechanics of the iPhone in terms of backup data in the cloud? \nFor example, if for any reason, such as password forgot or whatever you need to reset to factory setting the apple watch, can you make a restore from a backup or do you need to sync again all the info from the Apple Watch app on your iPhone? How does it work? \nI am pretty sure that I understood that when the Apple Watch is paired with the iPhone it continuously sync data with the iPhone and the iPhone itself does the cloud back up, but I would like to know more about it. \n\nA: Yes, the Watch uses basically the same mechanics as the iPhone, since it more or less piggybacks it's backup with the iPhone's backup.\nIn your given example you would likely want to first unpair the Watch in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.  You might notice that the unpair process takes a while (a minute or two) compared to unpairing of other bluetooth devices, this is because the Watch automatically backs up to the iPhone when unpairing is initiated.  When you pair the Watch back to the iPhone you will be prompted to set it up as new or restore from a backup, similar to how an iPhone asks when you first set it up.\nSource - Just had this conversation with an Apple Genius yesterday when dropping my Watch off for service.\nThis Apple KB article explains this as well - HT204518 Back up your Apple Watch\n\nA: Even on iOS 14 and watchOS 7, there is no good indication a watch backup ended or worked. No way to view if a backup is done, no warning when backups fail, and no warning if backups don’t happen for extended periods.\nI have to keep a second watch around (or borrow it from a friend)  to try a restore to even see if my watch backup is viable.\nEvery other device is a first class citizen with date and time in iCloud settings. It’s odd the watch, which contains your most personal data, isn’t logged as being backed up.\n\n\nApple Watch backups seem to be far more fragile than iOS backups to iCloud. For example, since learning that I can check the backup status on my iPhone in Settings.app > General > Storage & iCloud Usage > Manage Storage under STORAGE and not under ICLOUD > scroll   all the content up, again and again to find Watch (usually the   smallest item so it's at the bottom of the list)\nMy watch hasn't backed up since 9/10/15 and I get no warnings, no errors, no backups since Watch OS 2.0 was loaded on my Watch. iOS 9.0.1 hasn't improved things.\nI recommend checking on this and requesting support from AppleCare if you don't see backups happening every day. There should be better feedback and an easier way to know your watch is backed up plus some sort of noticeable warning when daily backups are missed for days or weeks at a time.\nMy devices all back up to iCloud and never seem to be more than a day between backups (sometimes they even back up in the middle of the day without asking - YAY) but the watch backup seems exceedingly fragile in my experience.\n\nA: Check this Apple's official document in-order to know how backup works and how it can be done: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204518\n", "Q: Yosemite crashes on startup with henge dock I am running a 13' macbook pro early 2015 inside a Henge dock (HD03VA13MBPR).

Since I'm a Hungarian, but I learn and work in English, I switch the spelling settings in System Preferences approximately 50 times a day, because I'm constantly working with both languages.\nIs there any fast way to change the spelling without opening the System Preferences every single time with a shortcut?\n\nA: You can set the Language spelling to look for spelling in multiple languages.\nMy example is English and Spanish.\nIn the Keyboard System preferences go to the Text tab.\nSet the Spelling dropdown to: Automatic by Language\nThen opening the Spelling dropdown go down to Set Up…\n\nDrag your two (or more) preferred Languages to the top. And then hit the Done button.\n\nThats it.\nSpelling will now recognise the language you are working in.\n\n\n", "Q: Separate multiple comma separated values in Numbers One of the CSV files I'm using has lumped the address into one single cell, separated by commas.\nFor example: 12 Fairy Tale Lane, Wonderland, Oz, Neverland\nI need to separate these into Address 1, Address 2, Address 3 and City columns\n\nA: Here is a suggestion from https://discussions.apple.com/message/26532955#26532955\n\nIn order to import comma-separated CSV into Numbers.app properly, you need to set the decimal separator to period in System Preferences. If decimal separator is set to comma, Numbers.app can only import semicolon-separated CSV.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Quit Numbers.app;\n  \n*Set the decimal separator to period, temporarily, in System Preferences; [/Language & Region/Advanced]\n  \n*Launch Numbers.app, import the CSV file and save the resultant Numbers file;\n  \n*Quit Numbers.app;\n  \n*Reset the decimal separator to the original (presumably, comma) in System Preferences;\n  \n\n\nA: CSV files are just plain text files; you could use something like BBEdit to edit, search, replace and then save the file.\nIn CSV you can also encapsulate values in between \"\nSo your CSV file should in fact look like: \"Address 1\",\"Address 2\",\"Address 3\" please note: no space after the coma and before the opening double-quote.\nBonus: while editing your CSV, you can also use the vertical editing mode in OS X: press option key and click-drag-vertically to select a column of text. Once the column selected you can start typing: it will write what you type on all the lines. It's like magic!\nHowever, by experience, I would advise you to get to the source of the CSV file and make it use the double quote.\nHope this helps! Good luck!\n", "Q: How can I have xterm execute my .login file when it opens? The title says it all.  I'm running Yosemite 10.10.3 with XQuartz 2.7.7.  Thanks for the help!\nExpanded:  When a new terminal opens (e.g. terminal or item, which I mostly use) the file ~/.login is executed.  This sets up environment variables, etc, that I use.  When xterm opens it does not execute ~/.login, so I have to source it before beginning any work. So far so good.  Obviously, if i can get the .login file executed when the xterm opens I'd save a bit of time.  The problem is when I spawn a command to execute a shell command that is defined in the .login file.  This does not work if the .login file is not executed when the shell opens.  This is painful.  I've tried creating a .xinitrc file, but that does to seem to work 100%.  I need something better.  Of course, if I were a real unix person I'd probably know this, but...\nI'm using tsch.  btw: if .login is the wrong file I'm happy to get the job done some other way that works.\n\nA: From man xterm:\n-ls This option indicates that the shell that is started in the xterm \n    window will be a login shell (i.e., the first character of argv[0] will be a dash, \n    indicating to the shell that it should read the user's .login or .profile).\n\nFrom man tcsh:\nA login shell begins by executing commands from the system files /etc/csh.cshrc\nand /etc/csh.login. It then executes commands from files in the user's home directory:\nfirst ~/.tcshrc (+) or, if ~/.tcshrc is not found, ~/.cshrc, then ~/.history (or the\nvalue of the histfile shell variable), then ~/.login, and finally ~/.cshdirs (or the\nvalue of the dirsfile shell variable) (+). The shell may read /etc/csh.login before \ninstead of after /etc/csh.cshrc, and ~/.login before instead of after ~/.tcshrc or \n~/.cshrc and ~/.history, if so compiled; see the version shell variable. (+)\n\nNon-login shells read only /etc/csh.cshrc and ~/.tcshrc or ~/.cshrc on startup.\n\nSo in your case you can either make sure that xterm is called as xterm -ls (to have it act as a login shell) or rename .login to .cshrc (or .tcshrc).\n\nA: I had the exact same problem, which appeared after updating to the latest Mac OSX.\nOpening a new terminal generated an error, namely 'If: Expression syntax', and .login was not executed.\nSolution: delete the file /etc/csh.login, or inspect it to see if it contains an offending statement (in my case, a line executing a script associated with the mdsplus package).\nHope that helps\n", "Q: I bought a used iPod touch 5th gen on eBay, but it's connected to their iCloud! Is there any way I can sign out without their password? They refuse to tell me (would you tell someone your iCloud password?), and I can't disable Find My iPod. I'm on the latest iOS (8.3). Thanks for your help!\n\nA: You can delete the iCloud account without a password I think.\nDoes this help?\n\nA: If you have access to the iPod, go to Settings -> iCloud and then press Sign out. I think that should work without having to enter any password. Then you can add your own or do whatever you want. \nIf you don't have access to your iPod because they're locking it using Find my iPhone, there are either two ways\n1. They tell you the password to access the device\n2. You force your iPod to enter DFU/Recovery mode so you can restore it using iTunes.\nHope this helps :)\n", "Q: How to open migration assistant on an ipad How do I open migration assistant on an iPad-2?\nI have tried in settings but can not find it.\n\nA: If you still have the old iPad, make a backup via iTunes or iCloud, reset the new iPad if you have already activated it as a new iPad, and when asked, select the \"Restore from backup\" option.\nFull instructions here: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH12521\n", "Q: How do I move an app out of a folder on iOS 8? (e.g. newspaper out of \"newsstand\") The news app I use most frequently is buried in Home->News->Newsstand.\nHow can I move this app up to my first main page of apps?\nHere I mean the New York Times app, which I want on my home screen. I've tried holding the NyTimes app until it wiggles, but it won't move out of the Newsstand (violating my expectations of the ability to move anything shaped like an app anywhere I want).\n\nA: Maybe say what version of iOS you are using?  \nNewsstand is not a normal folder.  You put items into it by subscribing to them.  And remove them by un-subscribing.  You can move Newsstand to the top level, though, in the same way as you move other icons (see the documentation).  One way is to use iTunes, switch things around there, then sync.  Another way involves holding your finger on the icon until it starts wiggling, then drag it.\n", "Q: How can I remove the \"apple watch\" app, which recently appeared on a home screen? I don't mind that it showed up.\nBut I want it gone.\n\nI could put it into a folder called \"things I don't use\".\nBut I'd rather just delete it.\nIf I ever buy a watch, I can just download the app.\n\nA: You can't remove several of the Apple-supplied apps (try removing the ever-useful Stocks app, for example).\nThe Apple Watch app is one of these.\nGenerally, people tend to move these to a folder that they use to hide the 'useless' apps, or move them to a different screen - just so you're not staring at them all the time.\nWhere I live, the Apple Watch is not even available yet, but still I got the app staring at me to remind me of this constantly. It got hidden pretty quickly!\n", "Q: How to create new folder using contextual menu in MAC OS? I want to create a short cut to create new folder from the right-click/contextual menu in Mac Mavericks. What is the procedure to do so?\n\nA: I know some people prefer the mouse, but as an alternative for completeness sake...\nOf if you prefer SHIFT-COMMAND-N in any window (including right on the desktop) will create a new folder right there.\n\nA: When you right click on the desktop or a Finder window the first menu item should be \"New Folder\", just select that. \n", "Q: Why isn't iTunes starting on my mac? I am trying to figure out why iTunes is not starting on my mac.

Does anyone have any ideas?\n\nEDIT: \nLogged in as Guest User and experiencing the same behavior.\nOther seemingly related apps (eg- iBooks, keynote, app store, photos) have no trouble opening either as the regular user or as the guest user.\n\nA: I have a workaround. Not a fix, but something that allows me to open itunes.  I've created this bash alias:\nalias itunes='/Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes --x &'\n\nNow, whenever I type itunes in the terminal, the application opens.\nThe --x option is not valid AFAIK. For some reason, passing a command line option kicks iTunes to  open. When passing no parameters, iTunes does not open.\nI cannot explain this behavior and would appreciate an explanation if anyone has one.\nI'm going to try @Tetsujin's suggestion to see if it provides a complete fix.\n\nA: Choose Force Quit from the Apple menu, or press Command-Option-Esc.\nThis is similar to pressing Control-Alt-Delete on a PC.\nSelect the unresponsive app in the Force Quit window, then click Force Quit.\n\n", "Q: How to delete photos I want to delete photos in the new photos app but can't find any delete or trash icon.

They are then moved to a recently deleted album.\n\nA: I guess you mean deleting from the database not removing from an album!\nFor me pressing \"Cmd+Backspace\" does the job in any occaion. \n", "Q: Getting the Mac to read PDF files aloud I tried previous suggestion to have my MacBook to read PDFs with speech.

Nothing happens. \nI checked to make sure it reads using other documents and/or screen text. \nMy eyes need a break and I would like to get speech to read aloud the PDFs. What other suggestions do you have?\n\nA: Preview voice reading will happen after selecting the text you require to be read first / as mentioned above it needs to be selectable and recognisable text - then proceed with previous steps: Edit -> Speech -> Start Reading\nHope this helps\n\nA: A command line solution:\n\n*\n\n*Install homebrew.

It's a hassle to copy pages and pages into it, but for now as mac read won't do this, this is what i do, and it does the job.\n\nA: For me, the speech > start speaking feature only worked when I selected all the text in the PDF (cmd + A) first.\n\nA: VoiceOver can only read PDFs that are actually text-encoded. If they are simply image files, it has nothing to \"read.\" You can use Acrobat Pro or another PDF application like Abbyy FineReader or ReadIRIS with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to \"read\" the graphics and convert them to text. Then you can use VoiceOver to speak if for you. OCR isn't perfect, but it's enough where you'll be able to understand it. \n", "Q: Is there an emulator for the Apple Watch? I was wondering if there were any simulators that I could download that would emulate the functionality of an Apple Watch?\nI know the watch was just released, but is there something that simulates its functionality?\n\nA: You can simulate the Apple Watch using the latest version of Xcode on the Mac AppStore.\nTo run a watch app, you run the app on the iPhone Simulator with an Apple Watch target (the target is added in the Xcode project). The Watch Simulator then starts automatically.\nYou will need the source code for both the iPhone and watch apps.\n", "Q: Send wifi password from iPhone to iPad I have an iPhone and an iPad. iCloud keychain sync is on. I'm in a location with a secret wifi password that is on my iPhone and not on my iPad. My iPhone isn't jailbroken and I already know I can't see the wifi password on my iPhone. \nIs there any way to pass the wifi password from my iPhone to the iPad?\n\nA: The simplest would be to just retype the pass. if you don't know it, then you cannot access the password saved. Here is an explanation. And if you can, configure a certificate authority and a key (That would be shared between your iPhone and iPad) to access the Wi-Fi.\n\nUnfortunately, on the iPhone it is not possible to access this information. The passwords are kept on your phone in a safe place that is not accessible through any regular means on the phone. This is done for your protection, if you were to lose your iPhone and someone picked it up, the passwords that are stored on it would be up for grabs. This would lead to a lot of security problems.\nI would recommend apps like 1password or the many other pieces of software out there that do the same thing to keep your passwords safe and backed up. I have way to many passwords to remember and it has been a life saver. 1Password even has the ability to back up your passwords to dropbox just in case something happens to your phone and you need to access it from somewhere else.\nThere are a lot of different password managing apps out there, just find the right one for you.\nAs gtm above me stated, there is a way to access your passwords but it is through jailbreaking. I do not recommend jailbreaking, that is something that you have to make the decision on for yourself. Jailbreaking is not for everyone.\nI know this may not have been the answer you were looking for, we have all been there when we forget a password and there isn't a way to retrieve it. The easier thing you can do is just reset the password on your router and make sure to keep that password safe.\nI hope this answer helps somewhat.\n\n\nquotation from answer by @de_an777\n\nUpdate:\nI just noticed you seeing this quotation because of the link to the thread.

I want to create a shortcut to open a Terminal window from within a folder using contextual menu in Mavericks.

I want the OSX to show all kind of hidden files including ._ files too. I do not know exactly what I did, but I am successful in seeing .DS_STORE files, but not ._ files. Any idea how to achieve that?\n\nA: Open up terminal, and write:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\n\nThis makes you see dot files and hidden files in a grayish tint. You open . files with right click open. I do not know why you cannot just double click them though. If it is a problem, ask a separate question on that.\n\nJust a little bonus:\nYou can hide files by issuing:\nchflags hidden /path/to/file\n\nand unhide by issuing:\nchflags nohidden /path/to/file\n\n\nA: The issue is that zip files just contain one string per path whilst OS X paths point to a file and also metadata and resource forks. When HFS+ directories are zipped OS X tools will put this metadata and other info into ._ files in the zip if copying to another file system. See this Ask Different question\nI think (but have not found a reference) that when an OS X aware tool unzips an archive with ._ files in it will reapply them as metadata or resource forks i.e. the opposite action to the one that created the ._ files\n", "Q: Applescript or Automator service that automatically trusts certificates I would like to know, if there is a way to make an Automator service or an Applescript that automatically trusts a root certificate.

I want to force format of the hard drive, but neither Disk Utility nor Terminal commands works (Apple may have locked these functions). \nI tried the procedures described in this topic, without any success. \nWith Mac OS Yosemite 10.10, the following message is displayed in Terminal:\nUsage: diskutil coreStorage delete lvgUUID|lvgName\n\nDelete a CoreStorage logical volume group. All logical volumes will be removed.\nOwnership of the affected disks is required.\n\nIs there a way to overpass this with Mac OS X? \n\nA: If a partition was encrypted with FileVault, and you have forgotten your password, you need to boot into the Recovery Partition to format the partition / drive. (Hold down Command+R during startup to get there.)  From there, you can use Disk Utility to erase the encrypted partition.\n\nA: You can simply wipe the disks. Wipefs or even parted could be used, or you could just write zeroes to the drive using dd.\nThe osx tools have some protection against deleting partitions in case of a corestorage being there.\n", "Q: Bootcamp Windows 7 installed but no wifi capability or USB drive?

I've got a mid-2009 macbook pro that generally runs well. Unfortunately, though, I've started having problems with one key on the keyboard ('o'). It works intermittently. To type the letter I either need to press the key several times or hold it down for several seconds.\nDoes anyone have any pointers on how I might be able to restore function to my 'o' key?  I'd stress that I'm sure the problem is mechanical, with the hardware, not with the software. I'm wondering if there's a way to disassemble and clean the keyboard, or a way to replace part of it.  Any suggestions are appreciated.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible to replace individual keys without replacing the keyboard.\nI recently replaces right SHIFT, right OPTION and several f1 - f12 keys on my 2011 13' MBP. SHIFT key was chipped on the bottom edge, which made it unaesthetic. OPTION fell off. I customized my fn keys with Karabiner, so the symbols on them no longer apply.\nMechanically, the replaceable bits come in two parts, the cap, which is black and covers all you can see, and the clip, which is white and lays underneath. The part where the cap holds onto the clip is most fragile. There are instructions about how you pop the cap. I say you should be prepared to replace a key if you decide to pop it, since, especially for first timers, removing the cap might damage the key irrevocably.\nI decided to replace my own keys because 1) my machine is outside of warranty, 2) a professional would only replace the keyboard as a whole and that costs way more than buying a keyboard myself, 3) replacing a keyboard myself is a big project that requires gutting the entire machine.\nI used a Chinese ecommerce site. The parts cost less than a dollar each. I'm sure you can use ebay. One big caveat is that you should send the seller a picture of the cap and clip you are trying to replace. Even in machines with same spec, the keyboard can be different. A fraction of a millimeter difference could mean whether a cap and clip can fit onto the existing keyboard.\n", "Q: Screen saver no longer asks for a password I'm using a MacBook Air 13\" mid 2012 with Yosemite 10.10.3, it rebooted itself this morning without a reason and since then the screen saver is no longer asking for a password on unlock.\nThis is a great security flaw but I can't find a solution, I've tried modifying the security option by unchecking and checking everything again but it just does not work.\nAnyone had this issue and know how to fix it?

This can be done manually with the built-in Screen Share app, but isn't nearly as easy and convenient as just clicking on them then hitting Share Screen in a Messages conversation.\n\nA: You can use http://www.showmypc.com and just execute it with a code. You must have Java installed though. OR you can use VNC or Remote Desktop. \n", "Q: Do apps like GeekTool cause performance degradation? I started recently using GeekTool and I used some Geeklets for weather, date, and time, things that I had to let it refresh every two or three seconds.\nHere is a screenshot of my desktop\n\nI know (but I'm not sure) that this might cause the computer to run slower, but I would like to know if really does cause performance degradation on my Mac?\n\nA: My experience is that Geektool can significantly affect performance on My Macbook Pro (early 2011 running Yosemite).\nI've noticed that both Fans start to max out at 6000+ RPM and applications become sluggish. Geektool itself does not appear to be hogging CPU or memory but something related to it is. It's not the geeklets as they are only echoing out some text and running df -h every 5 seconds.\nOne thing I've noticed is that the WindowServer process seems to start eating a lot of cpu while Geektool is running. My hunch is that this is the problem - I use my Mac almost exclusively with a large external monitor attached.\nSo if you do experience performance lag, it may be the individual geeklets if they are doing anything intensive or some combination of Geektool + other applications which need to draw to the screen a lot. Try a search on this site for WindowServer too - there seem to be other people seeing issues with WindowServer causing performance problems on Yosemite. \n", "Q: OS X contacts: Related name - In which direction does the relationship field work correctly? How do I correctly use the \"related name\" feature?\nIn which direction does it work?\nDoes the relationship label indicate what the edited person (full contact sheet) is to the stated person (field data), or what the stated person is to the edited person?\nExample: Jane is Jon's daughter.\nI edit contact Jon. Which of the following setups is correct?\n\n\n*\n\n*a) Daughter: Jane (= Jane is Jon's daughter)\n\n*b) Father: Jane (=Jon is a father to Jane)\n\n\nI found nothing via Google, Apple Support pages, Contacts.app help menu nor here on StackExchange. Only some sites where people complain that Siri fails to interpret \"call my <relationshipEntity>\" (mostly \"call my wife\"), which my guts tell me is related to a false usage of the relationship field.\nI think this topic would be worth to be addressed in official Apple documentation. It is a usability problem. Possible a harder task for users than Apple's UX designers and developers thought, particularly regarding internationalization/localization. Maybe in English the semantics and mental concepts on \"related name\" are very clear, but in other languages it may be more ambiguous. A small tooltip which clarifies the relationship in a full language sentence such as \"Jane is Jon's daughter\" could help to establish certainty and/or avoid false usage.\n\nANSWER: The correct scheme is:\na) Daughter: Jane (= Jane is Jon's daughter)\nAs answered by @Thibault and comprehensible deduced in @Phong's comment. Thanks!\n\nA: I've always use this like the a) exemple and it always work for me.\nSo I think your a) exemple is good because it's like this I use the relationship field.\n\nA: Be careful using non-standard related names fields (such as \"son\" or \"daughter\", especially if you sync your iPhone / iPad with your Mac, as you will face problems with the sync.\nIt took me a while to dig it out but I had this issue with my iPad and iPhone not syncing with my Macbook.  I discovered the following errors in the console (under ~/Library/Logs/Sync):\n``\n|AddressBookSync|######|0x############|ISyncSession|Error| ISyncSession record validation failure: Value son pushed for enumeration property type on com.apple.contacts.Related Name is not an allowed value.\n|AddressBookSync|######|0x############|ISyncSession|Error| ISyncSession record validation failure: Value daughter pushed for enumeration property type on com.apple.contacts.Related Name is not an allowed value.\n``\nSync wouldn't work, and I couldn't find anything online about this.  And since you can't search for field names neither in iOS nor in Apple Contacts on macOS, I had to do things the manual way by export my macOS contacts to a PDF, and searching for values \"son\" and \"daughter\", then going back to contacts on both macOS and iOS and manually changing BOTH to \"child\".\nResult was successful sync again!\n\nA: This should be explanative enough.\nLet me know...\nhttp://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/iphone-contact-fields-related-name-social-profiles.html\n", "Q: Issues with /usr/lib/libcups.2.dylib. x86 applications will not execute I upgraded CUPS from 2.0.0 to 2.0.2 on OS X 10.10.4 Yosemite for security reasons per advisement from a Nessus scan. I committed the cardinal sin of not backing up my OS before making this change. Unfortunately, many x86 apps on my system are now displaying this fatal error:\n\nException Type:        EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) Exception Codes:\n  0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000\nApplication Specific Information: dyld: launch, loading dependent\n  libraries\nDyld Error Message:   Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libcups.2.dylib\n  Referenced from:\n  /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/PrintCore.framework/Versions/A/PrintCore\n  Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:   /usr/lib/libcups.2.dylib:\n  mach-o, but wrong architecture    /usr/lib/libcups.2.dylib: mach-o, but\n  wrong architecture\n\nFair enough. So I decided to run lipo -info on the affected library, and it states that its architecture is x86_64(\"Non-fat file: /usr/lib/libcups.2.dylib is architecture: x86_64\"). I deduced that the CUPS source needed x86(i386) flags upon configuration after a bit of research on the matter. So when I ran a new configure command:\nsudo ./configure CFLAGS=\"-arch i386 -arch x86_64\" CXXFLAGS=\"-arch i386 -arch x86_64\" LDFLAGS=\"-arch i386 -arch x86_64\"\n\nWhich was all well and dandy, but it executed with errors. I continued anyway with my make and make install commands on good faith, but found that now the affected applications either did not initiate at all, or still returned fatal errors. What am I doing wrong here? I downloaded the source directly from CUPS.org if anyone is wondering.\n\nA: From the INSTALL.txt file:\nAt lines 101–104:\n\nOn OS X, use the \"--with-archflags\" option to build with the correct set of architectures:\n./configure --with-archflags=\"-arch i386 -arch x86_64\" ...\n\nJust type in these commands:\n./configure --with-archflags=\"-arch i386 -arch x86_64\"\nmake \nsudo make install\n\n", "Q: Does the Apple Watch really identify \"you\"? In several places in the iOS Apple Watch settings app, important functionality depends on \"you\" wearing the watch. Critically under the settings for unlocking the watch without requiring a passcode (Security > Unlock with iPhone):\n\nWhen this is on, unlocking your iPhone will automatically unlock Apple\n  Watch — as long as you're wearing it.\n\nDoes the Apple Watch really form a signature for recognizing a specific user (analogous to fingerprint recognition), or should the above read \"as long as someone is wearing it (in BT range of your iPhone)\"?\n\nA: As far as I can tell its just means as long as it's connected via bluetooth and in range. There isn't a Touch ID scanner on the watch or anything like that so I don't think that it forms an knid of \"signature\" to you.  \n\nA: It’s unlikely even the Apple Watch series 6 is trying to differentiate one human wrist from another.\n\n*\n\n*resting heart rate, ECG traces, walking gait analysis from the accelerometer, blood oxygen levels and pulse profiles, recovery heart rate and calculated VO2 max calculations all might be very personal and tell which wrist a watch is on, but I see no reason or need that Apple is collecting or trying to identify us with watch sensors.\n\nI interpret the watch being connected to you as it can tell that the clasp is secured to a living human wrist and then can detect when the strap comes off that living human. Apple calls this feature Wrist Detect\nSo, if you were to put the watch on your friend and then authenticate Apple Pay - they could use your pay token for as long as the battery lasted and the device doesn't detect removal from their wrist. Similarly, that friend would now unlock your Mac as if you were wearing the watch.\nI suppose Apple could try to determine if you have an extensively dark sleeve tattoo, but I haven't heard reports of that changing pairing and only that it can affect accurate pulse measurements with some tattoos.\n\nA: The documentation only uses you to mean a person. The documentation is written with an owner in mind, so it refers to you, the reader, but not so specific as to your singular identity. It is not possible to uniquely identify people through the wrist.\nAny specific identification magic largely comes from communication with the paired iPhone.\n", "Q: Cable lock with Mac Mini How do I use a cable lock with my Mac Mini? It doesn't appear to have any mounts for the typical cable lock. Do I have to get an enclosure and secure that to the desk?\n\nA: Yes, you need an enclosure to use a Kensington lock. \nAs you can see Mac Mini doesn't have a pin lock. \n\n", "Q: How can I export my system preferences? Is there a way for me to export my system preferences on my Mac for quick install on another machine?\nAn example of what I am trying to accomplish is, when I start a new job, I would like to import my settings and have my system preference work without having to manually configure all of my custom settings.\nI am most interested in exporting settings for :\n\n\n*\n\n*Trackpad / Mouse\n\n*Keyboard\n\n*Dock\n\n*dashboard (I like to disable it)\n\n\nA: I wrote some scripts to backup and restore Mac preferences. It does both System and Application preferences.\nYou can grab them here: https://github.com/clintmod/mac-preferences-backup\nThey're pretty simple. I just loop over the domains from running defaults domains and then call default export [domain] [plist file path].\nThen to restore I just loop over all the plist files in the dir and run default import [plist file path]\nYou can modify the config.py file if you want to backup to a different dir. The default dir is ~/Dropbox/MacPrefsBackup.\n\nA: There is no specific way of doing this, but this is how I do it. My setup is redundant but it works the best for me and nothing is ever lost.\n\nTL;DR: Make sure you have homebrew installed. Then run the following.\n\nbrew install mackup\nmackup backup\nbrew install clintmod/formulas/macprefs\nmacprefs backup\n\nBut I recommend you read the docs of these two tools\n\n\n*\n\n*Mackup\n\n*MacPerfs\nPeace! ✌️\n\nA: I updated my answer because all of it was wrong:\n\nYou will want to use an applescript for your preference setups.

Though it is presumably in com.apple.spaces\nDock options:\n\nMouse:\n\nBluetooth Mouse\n\n\nA: If you cannot find an app/applet that does this, you might need to hack it yourself through Terminal.

You get find the same results by opening \n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.plist\nbut simply copying and pasting the .plist file to a new computer doesn't change the settings. You have to use import (and export) options.\ndefaults export com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad ~/Desktop/Test.plist\n\nMove Test.plist to the new computer, and:\ndefaults import com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad ~/Desktop/Test.plist\n\n\nA: There's not exactly an export function. You can find (most) preferences in the library. If you hold alt/option and select \"Go To\" in the Finder menu bar, you can open the user library. There's a folder named preferences which contains the corresponding files.

This entry is shown below.\n      480002496    1269536      3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n\nThe start and size values of 480002496 and 1269536, respectively, are OK, but the contents should be GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC.\nTo correct the problem you need to boot to OS X Internet Recovery and enter the following commands in a Terminal window. \ngpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk0\ngpt  remove  -i  3  /dev/disk0\ndiskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk0\ngpt  add  -i  3  -b  480002496  -s  1269536  -t  426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC  /dev/disk0\n\nOnce completed, you can boot back to OS X and open the Disk Utility application. The \"Recovery HD\" partition should no longer appear. You will need to move the slider on the \"Macintosh HD\" partition as far down as it will go. Click the \"Apply\" button to recover the free space.\nNote: The \"Recovery HD\" partition has not been deleted. Normally, it is hidden by the Disk Utility application. The partition will still appear when using the diskutil list command. When you move the slider down be aware the Disk Utility application will have to relocate the \"Recovery HD\" partition to the end of the disk. This can take a while, so be patient after clicking the \"Apply\" button.\nExample Using a Flash Drive\nI tested the procedure using a flash drive. Before fixing, the flash drive appeared as such:\n\nUsing similar Terminal commands resulted in: \n\nThis allowed me to move the slider as such:\n\nClicking the \"Apply\" button produced:\n\nIn your case, the small free space shown above will not appear.

I don't really know the right words to describe this problem, but every once in a while (sporadically, maybe about twice a day), whatever view is displayed on my iPhone (iPhone 6, iOS 8.3) screen will slide down to about a third of the way down the screen, as shown in these three screenshots:\n\n(I've whited out personal data.)\nAfter a matter of seconds, I think it slides back up on its own, though I've discovered that the most convenient way for me to cancel this phenomenon is by pulling the notification center into view from the top of the screen and then pushing it back up, which causes the main view to slide back up right away.\nWhat is going on here?

Until about a week ago, Apple offered a signed version of iOS 8.2. Now the file is not signed anymore. Is there any place where I can still download the signed version of the file? Does anyone still have a copy?\nBackground: I'm writing an iOS app that I'd like to test on my iPhone, but my version of Xcode can't handle iOS 8.3. As far as I can tell, there are only two ways of making Xcode compatible with my phone: either upgrade OS X to Yosemite or downgrade iOS to 8.2. I'd rather downgrade the phone, I only use it for testing anyway.\nLinks:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#Version_comparison_table\nhttps://ipsw.me/iPhone4,1\n(Or did I misunderstand the signing process? Maybe the file hasn't changed, and the signing somehow happens during installation?)\nUPDATE: Yes, I did misunderstand the signing process - during installation, an Apple server has to approve the file for the phone. :-(\nBut I found another way to make Xcode on Mavericks talk to my iOS 8.3 phone: I downloaded Xcode 6.3 from developer.apple.com, installed it to /Applications/Xcode-6.3.app, and copied /Applications/Xcode-6.3.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform to /Applications/Xcode-6.2.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform.

On iTunes for Windows, as of version 12.2, you can choose to automatically download all music, books, and apps. On iTunes for Mac, you can automatically download music and apps; and defer to the iBooks app to automatically download books. Movies, however, is not available on either platform.\nYou can automate it using Automator, however. Your Automator flow would look like this: Open iTunes, click Movies, My Movies, then press Command–A, Right-click on the selection, and choosing Make available offline, close the iTunes window. (Based on this.) You would then have to schedule the Automator flow to run at 02 am every night or something. Doable, but inelegant.\n", "Q: Mophie juice pack is being drained too fast?

It was working quite well given what happened but now the fan are going full speed, even after SMC & NVRAM reset. The SMC Fan Controller can see the speed of the fan (6500rpm) and I can't change it. Which is annoying.\nBut what is way more annoying is that now my trackpad & keyboard are dead. Well, almost dead. Because I can still boot my mac.

You need to see if the laptop is over heating when running the fan at full speed. Use something like TG Pro.\nFor trackpad and keyboard, you need to be able to see input live, so that you can tell if the trackpad/keyboard is in fact dead or working randomly. BetterTouchTool gives a live view of the trackpad.

Can't I just add the accounts on the new computer and they will sync automatically, leaving me at the same place as I was on my old Macbook?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: IMAP and Exchange both keep your email on the server.   Adding the account on a new computer will allow you to access your existing email on a new local machine.\nWhile you didn't mention POP3 in your question, that would be the email protocol that was designed to store your messages locally.

I use two browsers: one for personal use (i.e. email, social networking, YouTube, etc.) and one for professional/school (i.e. developing, school links, school-related searches, etc.). I recently stopped using Firefox as I was tired of the lag and slowness and replaced Firefox with Chrome. I have a 2012 MacBook Pro and it has made a world of difference in my browsing experience. I've noticed that Chrome is heaps faster and more responsive.\nI did some quick searching and discovered that Chrome for Mac uses the keychain on your Mac for storing/saving/remembering passwords. Does this mean having Chrome remember my passwords is just as \"safe\" as Safari (which presumably uses the keychain as well)?\n\nA: Chrome uses a combination of an internal database (LoginDatabase) and Keychain to store passwords.\nLoginDatabase stores some metadata, including usernames but not passwords, about each login that is stored. The site's URL, username and password are stored in Keychain. (The reason for the split is that extra metadata needs to be saved that isn't supported in Keychain.)\nIf you have your existing Keychain and a new Chrome profile, Chrome will not \"remember\" any logins. There has to be a matching entry in both LoginDatabase and Keychain for Chrome to display the login.\nAs far as password storage in Keychain being \"safe\", anything storing data in Keychain is only as safe as your Keychain password. Whether or not it is \"safe\" is a highly subjective.\n(See this and this for more information.)\n", "Q: iMac 2007 with accelerated graphics problems and kernel panics I have a mid-2007 iMac.

How can I get rid of this?\n\nI'm using a clean installation of Yosemite.\n\nA: To fix the problem, open Terminal and run (case sensitive):\nkillall Dock\n\nThis will shut down the Dock, and macOS will reopen the Dock immediately. When the Dock fetches the current state of notifications from Calendar, it will see zero pending notifications, and the badge will not show up.\nI've had this issue a few times. MacOS has some sort of bug that causes a badge to show a number of active Calendar notifications, even though there are none in Calendar itself. I've most often seen this issue when someone is sending out multiple calendar invites and updates in a short period (e.g. someone creates a meeting, then sends several updates to change the time, location, notes, etc.). I'll respond to each update one by one, and afterwards the badge will still show a \"1\", even though the notifications list in Calendar is empty.\nThis is actually a problem with the Dock. In macOS, the Dock is responsible for showing and updating application icons, including badges, check marks, progress bars and other state information that applications want to display. Occasionally, it seems, the state of the Calendar Dock icons gets corrupted or out of sync with the state of the Calendar itself. (This happens with other applications, too, e.g. Messages.)\n\nA: The badge is notifying you of a Calendar notification. There are two cases which causes a badge:\n\n\n*\n\n*You've been invited to an event.\n\n*An event on one of your shared calendars has been modified.\n\n\nTo clear the badge, open Calendar and click Notifications  on the toolbar, then take action on the notification by selecting Accept/Decline/Maybe on an invitation or OK for a change notification.\nAlso see What's this button on Calendar.app? regarding the Notifications button on the toolbar.\n\nA: I have the same problem in El Capitan 10.11.5 with Calendar 8.0.\nFixed it with a solution based on Django's tip in a previous comment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Calendar\n\n*Switch off all notifications for Calendar in System Preferences\n\n*Launch Calendar\n\n*Switch the notifications back on\n\n\nA: Use this button in the calendar app:\n\n", "Q: Troubleshooting a slow Mac - OSX 10.9.5 My 2012 MacBook Pro 15\", OS X 10.9.5, 2.6 GHz i7, 16 GB RAM, 750 GB HDD, has been acting very slow recently. Starting up takes a long time, not only for the login screen to show (if starting up from being turned off), but once logged in it takes about 10-15 mins to become responsive to the point were the Finder or any of the programs are responsive enough to be used. \nThen during normal use the machine can be running fine, but flicking between finder windows, quick previewing an image in the finder using space bar, move files can cause it to hang when ill then have to wait, or force reboot the finder, using force quit. Generally though everything seems quite lethargic. \nThe first thing I did was to check Activity Monitor, where as far as I can tell the Mac has got more that plenty of resources available (see below screenshots.) Although these are obviously taken at a set point in time they are pretty indicative of whats normally shown in the activity monitor.\nI've checked to see if the machine's indexing, which it isn't.  I've also noticed that the when I first open the machine, Dropbox is starting up which seems to make everything quite slow, but I don't believe it's the only culprit. \nI suppose I could upgrade to an SSD, but dont particularly want to as they are quite expensive for 750GB and the machine as far as I can remember wasn't always this slow and I've always been running the same tasks on it. \nIs there anything else that I might have missed in trying to troubleshoot and resolve these issues?\n\n\n\nA: The three simplest things to do to troubleshoot slowness is to write down what specifically you wish to optimize and then measure it. When you have a good baseline and preferably can reliably reproduce the conditions when it's slow.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new empty user and set the Mac to not auto log in. Reboot and repeat the test with the new account.\n\n*Look in the console logs for storage errors and boot into recovery mode to run Disk Utility to check for catalog or other errors.\n\n*Install a clean OS onto a USB drive and boot from that. As long as the drive is reasonably fast, you should be a bit slower on the external drive and could even point a user home folder there back to the home folder on the internal drive to see if it's a system issue.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have a silver bullet, but once you narrow down things to user level slowness or system slowness or hardware errors/degradation then you can dig into Activity Monitor and see if CPU or RAM or storage is constrained when your slowness arrives. From your snapshots, you have plenty of RAM and the system should only get faster with use as files needed get cached in RAM. Your CPU doesn't look loaded at all, so I'm guessing network or storage issues from the data you have provided.\n\nA: I eventually solved the issue, it seemed to be nothing to do with Finder at all, the issue was being caused by Dropbox indexing and starting up, I checked in the activity monitor if this was causing a lack of memory and cpu space, but it wasnt, which is strange. \nI uninstalled dropbox, then re installed it (do this still kept the dropbox files on my machine in a folder called dropbox) so when i installed a clean version it just started using the same folder again, although the dropbox app did have to index the folder for about 10 hours (ive got about 95gb in the dropbox folder). But not the whole machine runs allot faster even when dropbox is starting up or indexing. \n\nA: I solved my issue! Click the apple. Click \"force quit\". Adobe reader updater was running. I force quit it. I also force quit my browsers and relaunched finder. Now, finder is super fast!\n\nA: here iMovie was updating very, very slowly. It appears the update caused ping time-outs and fronzen web pages in both Safari and Chrome. I killed the iMovie update and deleted the iMovie app. Now the mac is happy. OS X Version 10.9.5 Processor 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7, 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, network not the zippiest, being an old DSL line, but perfectly fine for watching one movie at a time (not using iMovie of course....)\n", "Q: Erase partition without recreating one? I've got an external USB hdd that I wish to use entirely as a TrueCrypt volume. There was one pre-formatted partition, so I'm trying to erase that with Disk Utility. But no matter what I do or try, whenever I Erase the partition (or the entire disk), it keeps automatically re-creating a new partition.\nHow do I just erase the partition, without recreating one, thus leaving the entire disk empty (i.e. without even one partition) ?\n\nA: To remove all entries from the GPT and MBR tables, open the Disk Utility application and do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your disk. \n\n*Select Partition tab.\n\n*Set Partition Layout to \"1 Partition\". \n\n*Set Format to \"Free Space\".\n\n*Click on the Option... button and select \"Master Boot Record\".\n\n*Click Ok to close the pop up window.\n\n*Click the Apply button.\n\n\nThe image below was made just before clicking the Apply button.\n\n\nA: If you are comfortable with command line:\n\n*\n\n*Run diskutil list\n\n*In the output, identify the disk you want to erase all partitions from. It will be something like diskN (N being a number).\n\n*Run sudo diskutil unmount /dev/diskN. It might say diskN was already unmounted or it has a partitioning scheme so use \"diskutil unmountDisk\" instead, no worries.\n\n*Run sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN. It should say something like Unmount of all volumes on diskN was successful.\n\n*On the command line type sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/diskN bs=1 count=1024, double-check you have replaced N with the correct number as an error here could be catastrophic, then run.\n\n*Veracrypt will now be able to create an encrypted volume on that entire disk (I just tried now).\n\n", "Q: Is there a splitter for the Thunderbolt on my MacBook Air?

Chose the latest backup available, and you're set.\nMore detailed steps can be found here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201269\n\nA: Use iTunes to restore your phone the factory defaults no internet needed and you'll it will completely wipe your phone \n", "Q: How do I avoid update checks for third party software (cobook), dont want to \"update\" by mistake I have an app that I bought, unfortunately the company was also bought and the new version is seriously worse.\nHiding is not possible for third party software.\nRemoving MAS receipt makes the software \"damaged\".\nSetting softwareupdate ignore cobook, does not work either.\nThere has to be some hack available, I don't want to \"update\" by mistake, and it bugs me to see the red \"1\", since I usually keep my software updated.\nThis would however be a downdate.\n\nA: The MAS receipt is designed just so you can't do that - otherwise you could hand the app to all your friends without them having to buy it ;-)\nDid you try telling App Store to \"Ignore Updates\" - right click in empty space to the right of the App name… though I've heard reports this is no longer working in Yosemite; I've no updates to test on right now.\n", "Q: What can I use for mixing/muxing/splitting/leveling audio inputs and outputs? I was hoping to find a single tool that could arrange, in any configuration, any audio inputs and outputs on a Mac.\nA specific example follows.\nDevices\na) Line In from XBOX 360 Audio Out\nb) USB from Headset Microphone\nc) Audio out from Skype App\nd) USB to Headset Earphones\ne) Audio in to Elgato Game Capture (Narration track)\nf) Audio in to Skype App\n\nMIX\n1) a + b + c => d\n2) b + c => e\n3) b => f\n\nAudio needs to be mixed at different levels. For example, the USB mic level for headset, narration, and Skype can all be different.\nI have come close with Audio MIDI Setup, Soundflower, and several copies of LineIn. But I can't split and join audio easily and I can't save the configuration - it has to be painstakingly set up each time apps are relaunched. Rogue Amoeba's paid app Audio Hijack looked like a good candidate but I did not see how to send resulting audio to an application or to a virtual device that could be designated as input for an application.\n\nA: Audio Hijack is great for recording. For routing/combining inputs, look at Rogue Amoeba's Loopback. Unlike Soundflower, it is a paid app -- easier to use, supported, and handles multiple routings/combinations (which can be saved).\n\nA: Though I have not been able to get Audio Hijack to do it all, it comes close. I have configured it with (e) being the virtual device (2ch) from soundflower and setting the source for the narration device to that virtual device. As pointed out by @Tetsujin, (3) can be done within the Skype app.\n", "Q: Deleted 600mb Partition on Bootcamp-ed MBP while logged into Windows 8 using Disk Manager. No longer boots into OS X On Mac Book Pro retina ( 2014 ) Mavericks running Boot Camp, one hard drive partitioned to dual boot OS X and Windows 8. \nWhile messing on Windows 8 I mistakenly deleted a partition which is now showing unallocated 621 MB, using Disk Management. ( it was showing a weird phantom SD drive which i thought was some improperly mounted ).\nOS X won't boot and won't show in Boot Camp. Cmnd + R goes into internet recovery. My main data HD Mac partition is fine and accessible ( can copy data at least to backup my files).\nI never attempted any formatting and stopped a Windows partition recovery utility as i googled further and turned out it is(maybe) a bad idea.\nHow can I recover this partition/get back into OS X without losing data, having to reinstall both OS X and Windows? \nEdit: Just run diskutil list and this is what I get.\n\nA: Presumably you deleted the recovery partition, which is about that size. Boot into Internet Recovery, start the terminal and type diskutil list. If the OS X partition is still there, you should see it as formatted with CoreStorage (OS X doesn't require the recovery partition for a normal HFS+ formatted partition). If it exists, then the solution is to do a reinstall of the OS. This will not erase anything, but it will recreate the recovery partition. Note that you'll have to unlock your disk first if it's locked by FileVault 2.\nLesson for the future: Windows doesn't know anything about CoreStorage volumes, even with all the BootCamp drivers installed. Do not trust anything you see regarding your disks from within Windows, unless it identifies the disk as a format it knows.\n\nA: I am writing this so anyone else in my situation can learn from the experience in case they google it. I am not knowledgeable and have no clue about Os X, I was unable to resolve my situation in a timely manner and what I ended up doing is reinstalling both OSX and Win, it took less than 24 hrs. Don't do it if you know what you are doing but I had no other way of getting a hold of my machine again. Important lessons:\n\n\n*\n\n*NEVER MESS with your WINDOWS DISK MANAGER on Dual Boot Mac Book Pro.\n\n*BACKUP BOTH MAC and WIN side before attampting any fix, copy and paste important files, settings, preferences, etc\n\n*Used Internet Recovery to Re-Install Mc OS X, Installer couldn't find a working OS X drive and had to erase and format my mac partition as Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\n*During Internet Recovery I got stuck and looked up the log window and had an error \"Recovery Chunk Validation Failed\". Resetting NVRAM helped - Command (⌘), Option, P, and R.\n\n*Re-Installing OSX caused my Windows partition to DISAPPEAR. GONE.\n\n*Re-installed Win so MAKE SURE TO HAVE WIN ISO, HARDDRIVE that can be formatted ready.\n\n*Had another windows machine nearby to troubleshoot issues while going through this.\n\n\nWhich was fine because I was prepared. My solution was not smart and I lost both my OSX and Win installations, BACKUP YOUR STUFF!, but I have a working MAC today. Also - I had too much space dedicated to the Win install with a lot of apps crashing so this was a chance to get rid of the old Win install. That's it - thank you everyone.\nImportant: I am also abroad.. and the nearest Apple store is in another country. Otherwise I would have gone the Apple store route. \n", "Q: iPad mini Wi-Fi - can I use in UK and Australia? I want to buy an iPad mini Wi-Fi for my sister whilst she is in UK travelling.

The OS of the target doesn't matter.\n1) ssh to an unqualified host name alias (CNAME record in DNS), e.g. ssh aa, takes about 7-8 seconds to connect\n2) immediately repeating the same ssh command, ssh aa, connects in the \"normal\" amount of time (< 1s)\n3) ssh to a fully qualified host name alias, e.g. ssh aa.example.com, connects in the normal amount of time\n4) ssh to a regular host name (A record in DNS), e.g. ssh alpha.example.com, whether qualified or unqualified, connects in the normal amount of time.  \nWhen using ssh -vvv, the total delay is in one place:\n$ ssh -vv aa\nOpenSSH_6.2p2, OSSLShim 0.9.8r 8 Dec 2011\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config\ndebug1: /etc/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for *\ndebug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0\n    *delay of 7-8 seconds*\ndebug1: Connecting to aa [10.10.1.2] port 22.\ndebug1: Connection established.\n...\n\nThere is no difference in output between any of the 4 scenarios, except for the host name displayed.\nThis has happened on every release of Yosemite to the current version 10.10.3.\nI have searched the web many times, and not found a single reference to this problem. Ideas?\n\nA: I found a “fix” for this, though it still doesn't explain anything.\nIn our organization, we have “standard” DNS arranged hierarchically for different sites, just as you would expect. We also have an Active Directory structure that is largely flat. The resolv.conf (actually defined in Network Settings) had my local DNS domain listed as a search domain. I discovered quite by accident that adding the AD domain as a search domain fixes the problem!\nSo now I have something like:\nsearch mysite.example.com ad.example.com\n\nNow ssh’ing to an unqualified alias takes no more time than any other form of the host name.\nReally bizarre, and I have no idea why this fixes it.\n", "Q: MacBook Air is stuck at \"Downloading Additional Components\" I recently reset my MacBook Air to its factory settings.

I have tried turning on and off iMessage, restarting my iPhone and Watch, unpaired and re-paired my watch, and setting it up again as new. My watch will appear to try to send a regular (green) text message through my phone, but will get stuck on \"Sending...\" even though the text actually gets sent. I can send iMessages just fine on my iPhone. The people in my contacts who I am messaging do have iPhones and their contacts are set up as having an iPhone.\n\nAnd a little while later, my watch will say that the message failed to send, even though they were sent:\n\nAs you can see below, texts from my Watch end up sent as regular text messages, while texts from my iPhone to the same person get sent as iMessages. In the end, how do I get my watch to send iMessages?\n\nUpdate\nI had an Apple Store Genius appointment a while back to try and resolve this. At the time I was running the iOS 8.4 public beta and I was told to wait for final release of iOS 8.4 to fix my problem, as the Apple employee was also experiencing the same problem and was also on the beta. Now with the final release of iOS 8.4 out, I've updated and it still doesn't work. I'm also updated to Watch OS 1.0.1.\nMy Watch will also occasionally tell me that my iCloud password is \"incorrect\" and that I need to sign into iMessage/FaceTime again (my password isn't wrong, I've done this multiple times). Although it seems to only ask me this when the Watch dies or is manually restarted.\n\nA: Try toggling iMessage off and on again. I find that this fixes many iMessage problems especially after a system update.\n\nA: This worked for me when I had the same problem of not being able to send messages from the Apple Watch.\nGo to Settings → Messages → Send & Receive and make sure that 'Start new conversations' is set to your phone number, not e-mail.\n\nA: I just reset the Watch holding down both side buttons until the Apple Logo appeared and it worked fine. In my case the messages were not getting sent in iMessage, just as SMS. The reset fixed the issue.\n\nA: I signed into iCloud and fixed the problem.\n\nA: I had the same issue. \nI also had two step verification switched on. \nWhen I restart my apple watch my iPhone asks for the iCloud password. \nWhat it really means is go to appleid.apple.com and log in and go password and security and generate an app specific password for \"iMessage and FaceTime”.\nPut that in (including the dashes) when it asks for the iCloud password and hopefully it should work :-)\n\nA: I had to reset my watch and it finally started working again with sending messages by iMessage. I have iOS 9 and watchOS 1.0.1. \n", "Q: OS X 10.9: where are password hashes stored I think on previous versions of OS X, password were stored in the /etc/shadow file.\nNevertheless, this file doesn't appear to exist in the later versions of the operating system - specifically OS X 10.9 which is the first of the non-cat named OS releases.\nDoes anyone know where the password hashes are stored on OS X Mavericks?\n\nA: Starting with Lion, OS X introduced a shadow file per user that is a plist dictionary that contains password hashes and other GID/UID/kerberos and open directory type keys. \nThe shadow files are stored on the filesystem at /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users. They are in plist format so you'll need to use the plutil command to view them or use the defaults command to extract/write specific keys if desired. Only the root user has access to the files.\nTo view the contents of a shadow file for a user:\nsudo plutil -p /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/<username>.plist\n\nTo get the hash:\nsudo defaults read /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/<username>.plist ShadowHashData|tr -dc 0-9a-f|xxd -r -p|plutil -convert xml1 - -o -\n\nWhere <username> in the above examples is the user you're looking for the hash for. You want the <data> section that corresponds to the <key>entropy</key> key in that plist output.\nTo continue on to try and crack the password see this tutorial.\n\nA: I want to add to the accepted answer, just in case someone tries to get the password hashes stored on an OS X Server in Open Directory. For network (OD) users you need to\nsudo mkpassdb -dump\n\nwhich will get you a list of users and their respective slot IDs. Copy the entire slot ID beginning with 0x and issue\nsudo mkpassdb -dump slot_id_that_you_retrieved\n\nYou'll see several digest entries, amongst which *cmusaslsecretSMBNT is the NTLM password hash and *cmusaslsecretDIGEST-MD5 is the regular MD5 hash. Do with those what you wish, but I found it easier to submit those to https://hashkiller.co.uk/ntlm-decrypter.aspx which is a free online hash cracking service. It accepts your hash and if not yet in their database will start working on it. Return a week later and it should be cracked. This has been tested on OS X El Capitan and Mac OS Sierra. You may not see digests if some auth methods have been explicitly disabled on your server but they should be there by default.\n\nA: I looked it up on Google and found this:\nhttp://hackmac.org/forum/topic/2678-ceacking-os-x-mountain-lion-os-x-mavericks-os-x-yosemite-account-password\n", "Q: Is there a Terminal command that will list the current admin account? Does anyone know of a terminal command which lists the current administrator account?\n\nA: Users who have administrative privileges on OS X belong to the group admin. There's no straight forward way to list members of a group as OS X uses Open Directory to manage these things and it's a bit convoluted as a result.\nHere is a shell function that will give you all the members of a group. It was taken from this SuperUser.com Q&A:\nmembers () {\n  dscl . -list /Users | while read user; do\n    printf \"$user \"\n    dsmemberutil checkmembership -U \"$user\" -G \"$*\"\n  done | grep \"is a member\" | cut -d \" \" -f 1;\n};\n\nSave that in your ~/.bash_profile or just cut and paste it to a bash or zsh prompt and then you can run:\nmembers admin\n\nand you'll get a list of accounts that have administrator privileges on the machine.\n", "Q: What is the keyboard shortcut to set the language for text in MS Word 2011? I usually write in English, but I often quote things in other languages like German or French. I know that you can set the language, like the font under Tools -> Language. Is there a keyboard shortcut to make this easier?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and there will be various shortuc setups for almost anything. If you see something that is not listed, Make a service in Automator and add it as shortcut:\n\nHere you see the service in Automator. It ain't always have to be an AppleScript. You can chose other services from the Menu on the left.\n\nAnd here is a screenshot of enabling the service and assigning a shortcut by double clicking the shortucts on right, and pressing a combination of keys.\n\nhere is a full tutorial on services and automation as a little bonus to the question.\n", "Q: Applescript Move current file to Folder I want to create a script that takes the current file selection and moves it to an already existing folder. I will then duplicate this code for 9 other folders and assign them all keyboard shortcuts. \nMy application is rather specific and unfortunately I need to use Finder to quickly monitor audio samples rather the Terminal. (I am wading thru thousands of audio samples, deleting and sorting them into sub folders).\nThe idea is very simple:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    move selection to alias \"Users:Jordan:Desktop:0\"\nend tell\n\nThis code works; however, it then proceeds to move the parent folder of the target file into the destination folder. This action makes the script counterproductive and useless. I tried the same idea in automator to no avail either.  I have made long scripts to try and stop the tell from moving the folder too, but nothing has worked. \nIt's beyond me why such a simple function can be so buggy and difficult and why no matter how many variables I employee to make the selection static, or how many conditionals or delays I add, the script still moves the file in folder A to folder B THEN the folder A into folder B. \nHow do I move file in folder A into folder B without moving folder A into it as well?\n\nA: This might be a bit of a sledgehammer approach by Applescript compared to Automator's 'move' command, but as that's how the OP approaches it...\nTo do it as an Automator Service, so it's easy to hotkey it…\n'Service receives selected 'files or folders' in 'Finder''.\non run {input, parameters}   \n\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set selected_items to selection\n        set theFolder to ((((path to desktop folder) as text) & \"test\") as alias)\n        repeat with x in selected_items\n            move x to theFolder\n        end repeat      \n    end tell    \n\n    return input\nend run\n\n\nA: Actually I would use Automator. \nSet up a service and call it what you like. \nUnder the \"Actions\" tab select \"Files & Folders\". Then double-click/select \"Move Finder Items\".\nThen select the location you want said items to move to. Save it and then you can add it to the custom keyboard shortcuts. \nTo do this go to \"System Preferences\" and under \"Keyboard\" select \"App Shortcuts\". Next click the \"+\" sign and add in the name that your automator app was saved as. \nThen try it out!\n\nA: i know this is old, but i´m doing this with these few lines of code: \ntell application \"Finder\"\n    move selection to folder ((path to home folder as string) & \"Dropbox:Folder 01\")\nend tell\n\nIt works with single and multiple files.\n\nA: tell application \"Finder\"\n    repeat with thisFolder in (items of (get selection))\n        repeat with thisItem in (get items of thisFolder)\n            move thisItem to (POSIX file \"/Users/Jordan/Desktop/0/\")\n        end repeat\n    end repeat\nend tell \n\n", "Q: Use iphone or android as external mic for macbook using bluetooth Is there a way I can use an iPhone/Android phone as an external microphone for my Mac? Ideally without a cable i.e. bluetooh/wifi.\nEdit:\nSince this hasn't been answered yet, I would be okay with using cables too if people know how to do that.\n\nA: Using a cable, your iPhone can be an audio source by using the built-in Audio MIDI setup.  Plug in your phone and click enable.\n\nNext make sure your mac is set to use the device for input.\n\nThen on your phone select audio output to Dock connector.  Now any audio from your phone will be sent to your Mac.  To use it as a microphone you now need to use an app that lets you feed back your mic.

I often \"reverse outline\" my work by printing out my file, numbering the paragraphs by hand, and then making an \"outline\" of my essay/piece which then will help me to conceptualize what I am doing - and how to rework it. Is there a way to automatically add numbers for paragraphs in Word so I don't have to do it by hand? I know that you can add automatic numbering for lines but I can't figure out how to do it for paragraphs.\n\nA: Use the built-in Heading paragraph styles: apply these to your headings, and they will be numbered automatically. \nIf you do this you can also generate a table of contents (to use as your outline). \n", "Q: Is there a shortcut / an app to center the mouse on the current window?

In all of these the Guest OS/VM only sees a Wired Ethernet Adapter as that is what the software provides.  It does not provide a Wi-Fi Network Adapter even though the Guest OS/VM can connect to a Network or Internet using Shared Networking or Bridged Ethernet Networking (which can be bridged to the Host's Wi-Fi or Ethernet adapters) and does not show a Wi-Fi icon in e.g. the Windows Taskbar System Notification Area.  So even following the directions in Using WiFi in a Virtual Machine which uses Bridged Ethernet Networking the connection in the Guest OS/VM will still appear as a Wired Ethernet Connection.\nIf you want to have direct Wi-Fi connectivity in the VM, in other words have a Wi-Fi icon in e.g. the Windows Taskbar System Notification Area as if the virtual machine was a physical machine that had a built-in Wi-Fi Network Adapter, then you will need to supply your own USB Wi-Fi Adapter and connect it directly to the VM.

It also has Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Entourage, these are Unix Executable Files.\nI'd like to know how I can install Office 2001 on this machine. I don't have any prior Mac OS experience. Thanks.\n\nA: Office 2001 isn't designed to run natively on OS X. It needs either OS 9 or some form of translation software.\nApple used to provide this in the form of Rosetta, which was part of the OS X operating system until OS X 10.6 in 2009.\nIt used to be available as an additional download by launching the App Store, or by installing it from the 'Extras' folder on the original 10.6 installer disks.\nI'm not certain if Office 2001 is even actually too old to run under Rosetta, or whether it must be run specifically under the Classic Environment, i.e. OS9.\nOffice X was released to specifically address that.\nThe simplest workarounds might be\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a newer version of Office, that supports OS X [possibly costly]\n\n*Get OpenOffice, which ought to be able to work with most Office documents, regardless of age [free]\n\nA: Mac OS X 10.6 and the hardware it runs on is too new to run Office 2001.\nOffice 2001 required Mac OS 8, 9 or Classic. To run Classic under OS X, you need a Power PC based Mac, and up to Mac OS X version 10.4. \nYour options: \n\n\n*\n\n*run Office 2001 in SheepShaver which emulates Mac OS 9 on a current Mac. This is a bit tricky to setup. You need a copy of OS 9, a copy of a suitable Macintosh ROM. Once setup SheepShaver should work well for Office 2001. SheepShaver Wrapper provides good instructions and a wrapper tool to make it easier to setup.\n\n*A number of apps can read an write Office documents. Apple's Pages, Numbers and Keynote do a good job of importing most of MS formats. \n\n*Mac OS X's built-in TextEdit does a reasonable job of importing most simple Word documents. \n\n*LibreOffice or OpenOffice are open source and do a great job of dealing with MS Office Documents. (LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice. I understand Libre has more development and momentum,  but I have not followed this closely.)\n", "Q: Home Server for an iOS developer | Xcode continuous integration I am currently developing websites and ios applications.

So shall I go for a any home server (and give up OS X) or does mac mini can handle my workload and be upgradable? \nI am more of a software guy and I really dont understand hardware:/\nAll the help is appreciated.\n\nA: A late-model, mid-range  Mini will be fine. If all you need is a personal webserver and compiler farm it's very good value. Probably not powerful enough for rendering 3D animation unless you're patient.\nYour storage concerns are very easily eliminated by plugging in an external drive. Get a small SSD with the Mini, store your stuff on a FW800 or Thunderbolt external. note that if you offload your storage to an external there is no point in getting a fusion drive.\nDon't forget backups, but do hook up the backup drive via USB2. Simple hardware throttling keeps the backups running at low priority.\nI have a 27 inch iMac running Server, it has no problems whatsoever keeping up with the load.

I thought I could do it over WiFi?\n2015 MacBook's don't have USB ports\nI also have a MacBook Pro but I don't want my iTunes library on this machine.\n\nA: To Sync your iPhone via WiFi your iPhone needs to be connected with a cable to the MacBook once. Then in iTunes there will be an option on the main screen for the iPhone where you can select \"WiFi Synchronization\". \nThis will make it possible for the iPhone to be synced when on the same network and manually when navigating to Settings > General > Wi-Fi iTunes Synchronization.\n\nA: Download VLC app on your iPhone. \nIn that it'll provide an option to sync via same wifi network.\nIt'll give you a http address you can enter on your MacBook, then simply drag and drop any music to the website and it'll send them over the same wifi network to your iPhone. \nRelatively quick and very easy to do. \n\nA: You need to connect the iDevice to iTunes with the Dock/Lightning to USB cable (you can use an adapter or Thunderbolt device that has USB ports) and enable WiFi Sync in the Summary section of the iDevice. There is no way to enable this setting wirelessly. Then it will auto-sync when the iDevice is plugged in and connected to WiFi.

To use the utility, click the download zip in Github. Extract the zip to your downloads folder and then run these commands in the terminal (copy and paste one line at a time, pressing enter after each line) to compile the program (only needs to be done once):\ncd ~/Downloads/fb-rotate-master\ngcc -w -o fb-rotate fb-rotate.c -framework IOKit -framework ApplicationServices\n\nAfter that is done, you can run the program like this:\n~/Downloads/fb-rotate-master/fb-rotate -d 0 -r 270\n\nThe 270 at the end is the rotation you would like. Applicable values are 0, 90, 180, 270. If you feel comfortable enough, you could move this out of your downloads folder, but you would need to edit those terminal commands. You could also turn it into an apple script to make the process easier. (Let me know if you need help with this)\n\nA: Make sure that you quit the System Preferences first. \nRe-open \"System Preferences\" and then cmd+option click on \"Displays\". You should now have access to the Rotation setting.\nThe quitting of the System Preferences is needed. At least, this is how it works on my Mac Book with OS X 10.10. \n\nA: My solution was the following. Yosemite 10.10.3 7/15\nGoto System Preferences / Displays\nMenu up to select \"Window\" - select the display you wish to rotate.\nOn my Dell Monitor - (model 1908FP) there was an option to \"Rotate\" \ntoward the bottom.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Terminal - While True Do - Can you stop automatically under desired conditions? Currently I am using a following command: while true; do python [file]; sleep X; done\nI was wondering if I can stop the loop if the result prints a word that I'm looking for. \nPlus is it possible to make a sound when it stops?\n\nA: You can stop the execution by entering the command break.\nTo make a sound, tput bel should work on most shells.\nSomething like the following example should work:\nwhile true\ndo\n     commands...\n\n     if [[ \"$YOUR_VARIABLE\" == \"value\" ]]\n     then\n         tput bel\n         break\n     fi\ndone\n\n", "Q: Images are \"Faded\" Emailed from Outlook 2011 for Mac I have a rather odd issue. I'm running in a Mac/PC environment at work. When I email an image (JPG or PNG) to someone from Outlook 2011 Mac and they open in Outlook for PC (2010), the picture always ends up \"washed out\" or \"faded.\"\nThis even occurs on the image signature I designed. Any ideas on what's causing this and how to resolve it? I'd rather not pop into Parallels every time I need to send an email. \nThanks!\n\nA: I've been trying to figure this out at work and here is what I've learned.\nSome PCs are prone to see a faded image when others don't, so be sure to test on a number of PCs (try to find the weakest link).\nWhen a Mac user copies a PNG and paste it into his email signature or the body of an email, this error occurs.\nI have to send out a company wide email signature, so here's what we do.\nHave a PC user draft the email signature, placing the actual JPEG images. When that email is sent out, a Mac user can copy and paste it and it should work.\n\nA: I had this same issue but with my signature and here is that I did.\nI manually saved the image to my computer, then dragged it into the email signature field and it went through just fine and was not faded.\nI don't know why it does this but I reproduced it a number of times.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I made a test mail with the image in the message and in the signature and the images in the signature had a different (wrong) color despite being all the same image file.\nI fixed it by deleting the the image in the signature and dragging a new one from the finder into the signature edit window.\nThe other suggestions found online by editing the signature in Word and copy/paste it in the signature does not work, it only helps with adding styling to the text in your signature.\n\nI find it weird that Outlook for Mac does not have a decent edit window for the signature like the PC version.\n\nA: I get this issue often.  I screen clip an image from powerpoint or excel, paste to Mac Outlook.  I notice that sometimes my WinPC friends get very washed out images.  Mac friends see the image fine.  I have worked out that a copy of a copy to Mac Outlook causes the issue.  I copy an image from PPT to Mac Outlook, send then later try and forward or copy it out and send again, that is when I get the issue.  \nSo to solve the problem: Copy directly from Screen Capture to Mac Outlook and send.\n\nA: Had the same issue but the drag-n-drop solution didn't work for me. \nWhat eventually worked was to get to the signature settings through Outlook -> Preferences (⌘ + ,) and then Signatures. Previously, I was always getting there from the Signatures drop-down inside a New Email window. Copy/pasting in the former resulted in perfect PNG rendering on emails sent to PCs when the same operation on the latter would result in a washed out image...\nI don't know what difference this can possibly make but it did it for me!\nI'm running Outlook 2016 (v15.21.1 build 160411)\n\nA: I just ran the original image trough Irfanview and saved it again... this eliminated the mac-bit that delegates how strong the image is shown ... since we have the image on a fileshare that is locally available for all users nothing had to change in the signatures...\nAfter the re-save with irfanview we were also troublefree with outlook mac vs outlook windows signatures... \nso people which say that saving the image on a pc didn't work; are obviously doing something wrong...\n\nA: The only way I could address it was to create the signature in Microsoft Word on the Mac side of the House.  Edit, Copy, Paste that into the entry Box in Edit Signatures.\nLame...\n\nA: Have a PC user draft the email signature, placing the actual JPEG images. When that email is sent out, a Mac user can copy and paste it and it should work.This is method is good.\n", "Q: Automator - How to know what I can do with Automator in each app I'm new to AppleScript and Automator, I've reached to stop and play next and previous track in Spotify, here's what I use inside the AppleScript:\ntell application \"Spotify\" to playpause\n\nfor play/pause^.\ntell application \"Spotify\" to next track\ntell application \"Spotify\" to previous track\n\nfor next and previous track^.\nMy question is, how can I know what else I can do with Spotify (or any other app) and automator, what any other word can I write instead \"playpause\", \"next track\" and \"previous track\".

Now the apps I downloaded before the updates by computer was made, are now bothering me a lot. Any time I want to update them, my iPhone asks me to enter the password for the Apple ID of that computer I used to update it.\n\nA: The computer you used to upgrade iOS was apparently signed into a different Apple ID when you upgraded your device. The thing that doesn't make any sense is that the Apple ID signed in on the computer shouldn't matter - you should have to sign-in on the device with a a different Apple ID for it to matter.\nThat said, you can try signing out of the App Store on the device (App Store app > bottom of the Featured tab > tap on the button that says \"Apple ID: xxxx@xxxx\" > Sign Out), then sign back in with original Apple ID.\n", "Q: Automated screensaver configuration in command line/shell script So I'm configuring some Default User Template LaunchAgents to configure a default screensaver for some of my company's most popular fan art. (It's actually been really well received by the team). They're designed as first-run images when they log into their forced-Local Active Directory users. \nHowever, I'm getting very inconsistent results now...namely it's not working at all. \nThe .plist launches a Shell Script located in the /sbin/ folder. The odd thing is that it mostly works in an existing user. \nThe screensaver is meant to use \"Flipup\" with a specific folder of images, shuffle the pictures and set a start time of 5 minutes. \nFor example, I intentionally set my \"default configuration user\" screensaver first to the \"Holiday Mobile,\" set the picture selection to \"Cosmos\" (one of the defaults) with a start time of 20 minutes and unchecked \"shuffle images.\" Then I changed it to \"Arabesque.\" \nWhen I logged out and logged back in to kick in the script, the result was me getting \"Holiday Mobile.\" However, when I went to \"Desktop and Screensaver Settings,\" \"Arabesque\" was actually selected though the \"Holiday Mobile\" preview was showing with a grayed out \"Screen Saver Options\" below. (However, the start time did change to 5 minutes and when I did click on \"Holiday Mobile,\" \"Shuffle Slide Order\" was checked properly.)\nSo in the test user, it's goes to Fan Art, activating Shuffle and changing the time. \nBut when I create a new user after adding the LaunchAgent .plist to the Default User Template, I get nothing but the standard \"Computer Name\" screensaver on a black background. \nI am totally confused on why this is occurring. Any suggestions?\nHere's the shell script:\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\n## Set Screensaver to Photo Slideshow\n/usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver 'CleanExit' -string \"YES\"\n/usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver 'PrefsVersion' -int \"100\"\n/usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver 'idleTime' -int \"300\"\n/usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver \"moduleDict\" -dict-add \"path\" -string \"/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/iLifeSlideshows.saver\"\n/usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver \"moduleDict\" -dict-add \"type\" -int \"0\" \n/usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver 'ShowClock' -bool \"false\"\n/usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver 'tokenRemovalAction' -int \"0\"\n\n## Set Type of Slideshow to \"Flipup\" (Results inconsistent)\n/usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.ScreenSaver.iLifeSlideshows 'styleKey' -string \"Flipup\" \n\n## Set location of photos to Fan Art \n/usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.ScreenSaverPhotoChooser 'SelectedSource' -int \"4\"\n/usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.ScreenSaverPhotoChooser 'SelectedFolderPath' \"/Manehattan Files/Manehattan Backgrounds/Fan Art\"\n/usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.ScreenSaverPhotoChooser 'ShufflesPhotos' -bool \"true\"\n\n## Removes the .plist LaunchAgent from inside the User Launch Agent Folder. \nrm -f ~/Library/LaunchAgents/set-screensaver.plist\n\nexit\n\n```\n\nA: So through JAMF, a very wise man showed me a very simple thing I needed to add to the end of my script: \nkillall cfprefsd\n\nSolved the problem entirely. While if you go into System Preferences, it still shows the old screensaver being selected, it works. \n", "Q: How to disable an email account when the password has changed?

Please re-enter the password for [email address]\n\n\nA: Disconnect from the network, then enter the password. The device can't check the password with the server, so enables the switches anyway, then you can switch the Mail toggle off to disable it.\n", "Q: Mute Outlook app on iPhone during holidays I have an iPhone which I use for work and private. Now I'm on holidays for a week and I don't want to see any notifications or e-mails. \nIs it possible to mute (or completely turn off) the iPhone Outlook app?\n\nA: If you do not want to receive notifications for the week you can simply disable notifications in the notification center. \nSteps\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings (the settings app for the iPhone)\n\n*Tap on Notification Center\n\n*Find Outlook and Tap on it\n\n*Tap the slider next to Allow Notifications to turn it off. \n\n\nThis will turn them off so you do not receive any notifications.

How do I do this?\n\nA: iCal is just the old name for what is currently Apple's main \"Calendar\" application (referenced here). They are exactly the same thing, Apple just rebranded iCal a few years ago.\nThat being said, there is a relatively easy (albeit lengthy) way to go about putting an Excel file into the Calendar app. Essentially you have to export the Excel document as a CSV, and then change it into an .ics format in order to get it to work. Instead of trying to repeat what I have found, here is the original article (updated as of 2013) which says it much better than I can in this small space.\n", "Q: Are there any iOS devices that run iOS 7 but won't be upgradable to iOS 8?

Upon further inspection i found that those gifs I hadn't looked at in the photos app, and hence hadn't done their white progress indicator thing, were missing. Once I'd let them do their white progress indicator thing they showed up again.\nSo I went through almost all my photos and gifs in the photos app to let them all get 'synced' (or whatever they're doing) so all my gifs would show up and then I noticed some that I'd previously 'synced' were missing again and required another 'sync' to show up again... What?? \nHas anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know what's going on? \n\nA: What settings do you have under Settings app > iCloud > Photos? I'm assuming you have iCloud Photo Library turned on and Optimize iPhone Storage checked. See this. \nRegarding the thumbnails not showing up in your GIF app, it's likely due to the way the app reads your photo library and probably hasn't been updated to account for Optimized Storage with iCloud Photo Library.\nIn an app that reads the library correctly, the thumbnails of all photos should show up, and for a photo whose full size isn't cached on your device, it will download at the time you tap on it.\n\nA: @Tubedog this is my problem too. I upgraded and now can't catch my thumbnails They flowery icon is grayed out. Everything checks out as stated above. If I try to attach mail, it takes the entire icon and says it will compress. If I double-click which would open all the photos in the past, there are no thumbnails and it just tries to compress the entire file again. Any suggestions.

It loads on start up automatically, and there doesn’t seem to be a preference to disable that behavior*. TeamViewer also does not appear in the “Login Items” system preference pane. I only need TeamViewer periodically, so for performance and security, I’d rather run it manually.\nI see three related processes in Activity Monitor: TeamViewer Host, TeamViewer_Desktop, and TeamViewer_Service. I don’t just want to stop the UI / menu item from showing on startup, I want to stop all of these from loading.\nHow can I disable them from running at login, and then how should I run them when I want them?\n* The “Show Computers & Contacts on startup” preference under Advanced isn’t it.\n\nA: The TeamViewer Host app is : \n\nTeamViewer Host is running as a system service and is used for 24/7\n  access to remote computers, including login/logout and remote reboot -\n  optimized for server maintenance or home-office access.\n\nSo it is intended to be running 24/7.\nBut if you want to disable it:\nFind it using the launchctl list in Terminal\nTo stop it use sudo launchctl remove label_of_program_to_remove\nThe label_of_program_to_remove is the one you found in the launchctl list.\nThat will stop the current session.\nTo stop it from coming back again next time you reboot, move the com.teamviewer files from either /Library/LaunchAgents/ or your ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ folder. Instead of removing them outright, you just move them out of the LaunchAgents to someplace else.\n\nA: Building on Buscar’s answer, for OS X 10.10 Yosemite:\n\n\n*\n\n*To disable: sudo launchctl disable system/com.teamviewer.service\n\n*To re-enable: sudo launchctl enable system/com.teamviewer.service, and restart.\n\n\nIt seems like launchctl is under active development by Apple, and has changed substantially in Yosemite (10.10). See man launchctl. They still offer ‘legacy' commands like remove, but caution, “subcommands from the previous implementation of launchd are generally available, though some may be unimplemented.”\n\nA: It is in Preferences in V 10.0.43320 which I downloaded and installed yesterday.\nGo to Preferences > General and there untick 'Start TeamViewer with System'.\n\nA: A simpler alternative is to install the standard Team Viewer version, not the Host one.\nThe standard version has the options you seek.\n", "Q: step counter, how do I add steps to the dashboard?

I want to return the phone to its pre-loan state when I'm done borrowing.\n\nA: You can do this, however you should just back it up to the owners computer first (with iTunes or iCloud). Then wipe the phone and when you are done with it, the owner can restore all of his data. \n\nA: You can receive iMessages by signing out of it and signing back in with your Apple ID.

Also hostname is correct. My old machine was mac mini. \n\nA: My guess is that your old keypair got copied over to the new machine (possibly when you restored from a Time Machine backup or even just manually copied over your user directory).\nEither way, that string at the end is just an identifying string; it won't affect your ability to use the key from your new machine as long as you are using the matching private key to connect to servers on which that old public key is installed. That said, if the username on your local machine doesn't match the username on the remote host, you'll have to specify the remote host username when trying to connect via SSH.\nIf you really want to, you can generate a new keypair and upload the new public key to servers you need to access; that new public key will have your MacBook Pro username and MBP identifier appended to it.\n", "Q: How do I select a directory to save files in Pages How do I select a directory to save files into?\nIn Pages I get the choice of Favorites or Recent Places?\n\nA: Use Save As\nin the pop up window click on the down arrow to expand that window and choose where to save it.\n", "Q: calendar sync between iPhone and Microsoft exchange My calendar events sync only one way between my iPhone and Microsoft Exchange\nIf I enter the event in my iPhone, it won't appear in Microsoft Exchange, but the other way around works\n\nA: You likely have multiple calendars on your iPhone and the exchange calendar is not the default calendar (the default calendar is where new appts are created).  The iPhone calendar app seamlessly accesses all the enabled calendars on the phone and presents them in one single calendar view.  (Think of these calendars like transparencies stacked on top of each other, you can see all events on all calenders at once.)\nOpen \"Calendar\" on the iPhone home screen and click the word \"Calendars\" just above the home button.   Find which color the dot next to your exchange calendar is (they aren't labeled as nicely in the next step, it may not be necessary but I need it because I have a lot of calendars).  While you're here if you only need one calendar you can \"uncheck\" others, so help avoid calendar confusion.  Unchecked calendars will not be displayed tho, be careful you are not hiding appts by unchecking a calendar that has appointments on it).\nNext open Settings app and go to Mail Contacts, Calendars, once that's open scroll way down to the bottom, the last item is where you set your default calendar.

I had a Macbook Air Yosemite which was FileVault 2 encrypted.  The laptop was stolen from me.  The thief was able to reinstall OS X and some apps (was bringing it to market for sale).  The laptop was then recovered and returned to me.\nI still have the recovery key and password used to encrypt the original partition.  Are the original encrypted files still recoverable?  I understand there are several file-recovery software solutions for non encrypted drives.  Are there any solutions available for this situation?\n\nA: I'm afraid there are not many options given an ordinary, \"home user\" budget.\nTheoretically you could send the drive in to a recovery service such as IBAS to get them to recover the original data on the drive. If this is even remotely possible depends on what kind of physical medium you had (i.e. is it SSD or spinning-platter hard drive). If they can recover everything, you can use the standard Apple tools to access the encrypted drive with your password or recovery key.\nIf you can't recover the full data set, you would have to inspect the data manually and probably create new tools for decrypting blocks of data using your recovery key. This will require specialized knowledge and skills, considerable amount of time - and with no guarantee of success. It is out of range for ordinary, home user purposes. FileVault 2 uses AES-XTS encryption - if you haven't got the recovery key and/or volume master key it is going to very hard (next to impossible) to decrypt.\n", "Q: How do I extend the lifespan of my MacBook's battery (2015 Retina Model) I have just received my 2015 Retina MacBook. I would really like the battery to last long.\nIs there anything I can do to extend the battery life because my retina MacBook Pro's battery got progressively worse over time.\nI am not familiar with the battery technology in the 2015 Retina MacBook but on the website its says:\nBuilt-in 39.7-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery \n\nA: As Allendar's comment said, read the documentation and help.  I suspect it will say something along the lines that you should connect the charger whenever power is available, and avoid a deep discharge.  These days I suspect the software will protect you as well.  \nBy deep discharge I mean to keep running the computer from battery power beyond the limit recommended for best battery life.  \nGet the computer to show the battery status in the menu bar, keep an eye on it, and act accordingly.  Especially if it says the battery needs to be serviced - when this happens, get the computer looked at as soon as you can.  \nI have a 2009 MacBook I am still using, and the biggest problem I ever had with it was when its first battery started to fail.  The computer warned me about it (via the status in the menu bar) but I, wanting to save money, ignored the warnings.  Eventually the battery truly failed, swelling up and causing hardware trouble.  \n\nA: Since it's impossible for a battery to deteriorate that quickly for a new unit, let's check several factors to find out who're the battery eaters. \nThe easiest way to find out battery killer is via activity monitor > energy. There you could find out the energy impact of individual apps. Perhaps you might notice some apps that weren't intended to run in the background were sipping your battery away without you noticing it. \nYour habit of using the computer might have a big impact on the battery life. \n\n\n*\n\n*Do you open numerous tabs at one go on Chrome/Safari? Make sure you only have those required opened.\n\n*Use HTML5 if possible instead of adobe flash\n\n*Close applications by \"quitting\" them instead of closing the windows, i.e. \"CMD+q\" instead of clicking the red 'x' or \"CMD+w\" \n\n\nHope this help.\nRobin. \n", "Q: Safe to Delete Keynote Cache under /Library/Container/com.apple.iWork.Keynote/Data/Library/Caches While the question \"is it safe to delete /Library/Caches\" is commonly seen, OSX also has another path for storing caches (not sym link). Keynote has another cache stored at /Library/Container/com.apple.iWork.Keynote/Data/Library/Caches. In particular, a subfolder named DocumentCaches store a some of my slides created in keynotes. \nIs it safe to delete this folder? \n\nA: Cache is cache. Deleting it is safe. It's recommended to have all applications involved closed tho. Tools like Onyx are mostly the best way to just do a periodic cleansing every now and then.\nIf you just intend to delete that cache; no worries. Just close Keynote and remove the caches. You might want to remove the app states for that app too if this is a matter of something behaving weird in while working in it.\n", "Q: Kali Linux on Macbook I have a question about kali linux on an Apple Macbook Pro running in Parallels.\n After giving the command sudo airmon-ng in terminal, it shows no interface. \nDoes anybody know what to do or is it not possible to successfully use kali linux in a virtual machine on a Mac?\n\nA: airmon-ng is a part of Aircrack-ng and if you want to use the Aircrack-ng software suite in a VM you'll need to provide your own USB Wi-Fi Network Adapter attached directly to the VM since Parallels, VMware Fusion and VirtualBox, only provide a wired Ethernet adapter to the VM.\n\nA: It is possible to run Kali Linux in a virtual machine hypervisor, such as VirtualBox, VMware, and Parallels. However, in order to connect to network interfaces - since you have mentioned the desire to use tools that require a connection to a Wi-Fi network - you will need a USB Wi-Fi adapter. I don't have much experience with Parallels, but I know that most virtual machine emulators allow you to connect other devices (again, such as an external Wi-Fi adapter). However, I know some people who have told me that plugging in such an adapter to a USB hub will cause some sort of \"input error\", just FYI. Also, if you are considering purchasing a Wi-Fi adapter, I would suggest one that does not require extra drivers to be installed, as that would require access to the internet. Lastly, if you are curious as to the reason why you would need to purchase a Wi-Fi adapter for your virtual machine in the first place, that is because the virtual machine is not allowed to access the host's internal Wi-Fi card, because it is a virtual machine and cannot interact with your computer on a hardware level unless you use something like a Wi-Fi adapter.\n", "Q: Problem with my iPhone 6 calendar After doing the last iOS update, I can't enter an event in my calendar.

Is there anyway I can uninstall the latest version and downgrade to 1.6 update 35? I think what I need is Java for OS X 2013-005 instead of Java for OS X 2014-001. The 2013-005 version won't let me install it now since a more current version is already installed.\n\nA: Apple provides developer packages at http://developer.apple.com/downloads and downloading Java For OS X 2012-005 is the version I need (update 35) through the developer site allows it to install even if a newer version of Java 1.6 is already installed.

If you do, log the time of each panic and list that in summary in your question (or ask a new one).\nThen find the Apple Knowledge base about troubleshooting kernel panics and progress through the triage steps.\nLastly, each time it freezes, run a sysdiagnose. You can do that by pressing all five keys and then releasing them at the same time - Shift-Control-Option-Command-.\nHow do you get system diagnostic files from OS X?\nBasically, you'll have some research to learn how to isolate the cause, then some data collection to know how often this is happening. Once that is done, we can dig onto the logs - especially sysdiagnose while hung or looking at the pattern of kernel panics.\n", "Q: Modifing a preference via applescript changes file group I recently request help about modifying firewall settings via command-line (see my previous question).\nEverything is working, but I have noticed that whenever I use this command in an applescript, the file group changes from wheel to staff.  \nBefore:\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel\n\nAfter running the script:\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff\n\nRepairing Disk Permissions fixed the issue but change it to admin instead of wheel.\nAfter fixing permissions:\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  admin\n\nHowever, I want to know:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Why is this happening, and\n\n*if it can raise security issues?\n\n\nA: In short, it doesn't matter.\nls -l print out consists of status (10 character), number of links, owner, group, etc.\nOf the first 10 characters describe file type(1), owner permission(3), group permission, and permission for others.

In short, there is no way of logging out!\nWhat I have already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried deleting the \"Home Screen app\" and adding it back, fresh!

It's set to not sleep, but it also has launchd jobs (cron is fine too if you want to maintain that older scheduling method) that SSH in to the client Macs.\nThe client Macs are set to allow wake for remote access, allow Power Nap (if supported) and set to allow SSH. \nWe have several AirPort and AppleTV that will proxy the ssh requests and send a wake packet to the client macs if they happen to be sleeping.\nThe clients then can have their cron tasks scheduled for when they wake.\nIf you spend too much time making this work, you can instead put a backup hook into the periodic tasks or convert them to launchd and have them run opportunistically even when the ideal scheduled time has passed.\n", "Q: Why does Preview lower image-quality I use photos from a digital camera and work with them in Photoshop/Lightroom. Today I again imported pictures from the camera into photos-app on my MacBook Pro, mid 2014, Yosemite 10.10.4/3 (I had the problem on both versions, stable and beta), and then, before I saw the export-option, copied the pictures and pasted them into Preview. \nAs a result, I noticed an extreme quality-loss, since the resolution always was 1024x768 by 72 pxi instead of 3072x1728 by 180 dpi (yes I know I stated different units pxi/dpi but that's the information I get from my software pix is preview, dpi is digital images, and I think there isn't much of a difference?).\nI'm wondering where this comes from, also because exporting works fine, without quality-loss and I would like to know how I can see the dpi of an image with preview-app / information-option.\nThank you,\nGabriel/Gabkano\n\nA: The Preview does not lower the image quality, but will fit it in the given parameters.\nIf you use Preview to open a original image: Example:\n5.5 MB file size with Dimensions of 3648 × 2736 pixels\nNow open the Preview Tools - Adjust Size to see the current settings.\nThe default resolution is set to 72 which is standard for web applications.\nIn that window you can set it to the original size/resolution.\n\nNow if you are using a copy/paste to move the image to Preview, the resulting quality will depend on the copy/paste settings. That can be found in the application it self.\n", "Q: How can I take my Keynote presentations Database from iCloud?

I want to do this because I want to get unlimited gems for free on Clash of Clans and so I could get other free stuff on my phone.\n\nA: At the time of writing, there is no public jailbreak for iOS 8.3.\n\nA: I'm not entirely familiar with the technicalities of how this works, but Clash of Clans has an extra payment verification system, as do many popular games, that prevent the conventional in-app purchase bypass from working.

For now I'm using an old MacBook 5,1 with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor and 2 GB RAM.  After using the Air for so long I kind of like the feel of this machine better and don't mind of the bit of extra weight. I am inspired by all the info available about upgrading this model, and I think it's a better solution for me than buying a new MacBook.  There seems to be plenty of info available about the process, but before I dive in I'd like some input from the folks that know a helluva a lot more than I do about this kind of thing: \nMy plan is to upgrade the 2012 MB with an internal SSD drive and enhance the memory, but once that is done, can I then use the Time Machine backup from my 2014 MBA to populate this computer, or will the format switch from MBA to this MB wreak havoc?  If it is a problem, can I just upgrade and do a clean Yosemite install and then just move over key files and applications from time machine to the 2012 MB?  As mentioned, the backup is saved on a Airport Extreme base station, and I have a memory stick startup disk from a clean re-install that I did on my MBA about a month ago.  Obviously I can't recreate that without my 2014 MBA, so can I use that or will it also cause issues? In the AppStore I still have the option to download Yosemite, so if I can't use that start up disk what are my options?  I'm only as good as the last YouTube video I watched about this stuff, which is dangerous.\n\nA: No, your Time Machine backup should restore to a supported Mac just fine.  I do it all the time to save time installing multiple machines from scratch.\n", "Q: How do I get my windows (UK Layout) keyboard to work on Mac? How do I get my windows keyboard to work on my Mac? I want to be able to bind the keys so it's like I'm using a windows computer, i.e. ctrl maps to command, but I've tried everything to no avail. Also, how would I map the symbols to the correct places, for instance \\ is where ` should be, etc.\n\nA: *\n\n*To change the modifier keys, go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard and choose Modifier Keys….\n\n\n*To map the keys to the correct places, go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Input Sources, click the + and choose British PC.\n\n*To ensure that your keyboard is identified correctly, go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Change Keyboard Type and follow the instructions to allow OS X to identify the keyboard.\n\nA: You can visualise how your windows keyboard is configured by showing the 'Keyboard Viewer'\n\n\nSystem Preferences -> Keyboard -> Enable 'Show Keyboard, Emoji & Symbol Viewers in menu bar' -> go on menu bar -> click on the new icon -> Show Keyboard Viewer\n\nAnd after that, you can reMap your keys with this really great soft :\nhttps://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/\nBy this way, you can easily revert your ReyMap to use the native Keyboard when you want.\n", "Q: Where is GNU info files stored on Mac OSX?

I'm running 10.10, and have a wireless mighty mouse. I want to turn off the right click on the mouse. I went to System Settings > Mouse, and set the \"Right Click\" function to \"Primary Button\" instead of Secondary. However, this has no effect, and the right click still functions as a right click. Why is this?\n\nA: For my Magic Mouse, Setting the Secondary click option to \"click on left side,\" simply makes it so that the \"right click\" (contextual) behavior is reversed.  i.e. left-clicking brings up a menu, and right-clicking is a normal click.  UNchecking the checkbox beside Secondary Click turns off the \"right click\" behavior altogether.\n\n\nA: Logging out and back in solved the issue. Doesn't seem right that you should have to log out to apply changes to the mouse settings, but it worked.\n", "Q: What makes OSX say that it's low free space on the boot volume for the program memory? I had 3 GB of free space on my 32G SSD drive when I decided to do an index rebuild in my apple mail. It ate up all the free space. I connected an external drive and moved some applications to free up another 3GB. I redid the rebuild and it ate up another 3GB. Then I moved the V2 folder from my\n home library (mail folder) to the external drive and created a symlink. I relaunched the mail, launched 'rebuild' and during reindexing it popped up a window saying that my boot volume doesn't have enough free space for the system memory, while in fact I have somewhat 15 GB of free space on my main drive. And 1.5TB on the external drivre. How do I fix this?\n\nA: First off, \"system memory\" does not necessarily refer to available hard disk space. It sounds like you don't have enough free hard disk space on your system disk to rebuild Mail's index. One thing to note is that an index rebuild is usually done by making a clean copy of the index, keeping the old file around until the rebuild is complete. Even if you've symlinked the file to the external drive, the index may be a separate hidden file on the SSD.\nIf the message truly did refer to \"system memory,\" it's also possible that you ran out of swap space, which can only reside on the system disk.\nMove as much as you can off the SSD and try one more time. You may also want to look around for the files caused by the failed index rebuilds and delete them (making sure, of course, you do not delete the real one).\n", "Q: How can I change DNS providers without needing to type in my password? On Mac OS X Yosemite, you need to enter in your password to change DNS entries. Otherwise the entries are all greyed out.\n\nI change DNS frequently (Gogo Inflight among others doesn't work with custom DNS resolvers) and I'm the only person that uses my computer. Is there a setting I can flip to disable password protection?\n\nA: The account you are logged in as needs to be configured as an admin account, because the DNS settings affect all users on the system, not just the current user.  If it is not an admin account, then you will need to authenticate every time you want to change the DNS settings.\nIf you are logged in using admin account and still have the problem, then open System Preferences, go to Security & Privacy, click the \"Advanced...\" button, and make sure that \"Require an administrator password to access system-wide preferences\" is not enabled.\n", "Q: Deleting a file from Single User mode My macbook's hard disk has 10 MB free space and the login is not possible.\nI booted to Single User mode to delete some files but the paths were totally different than the paths I get when I just click on Terminal app from /Applications/Utilities. For instance I've got 'var' and 'root'.\nAll I need to do is to access the Applications folder through the command line and then to delete some apps.\nCan you tell me how can I access the Applications folder?\n\nA: cd /Applications\nls -latrsq (shows all files, including their sizes)\nrm -rf Application.app\n\nIf the application name contains spaces, use a \\ in each space.  Example, Microsoft Word 2011.app would be Microsoft\\ Word\\ 2011.app\n\nA: cd /Applications\n\nThis opens the /Applications folder at root. There's no need to use relative paths.\n", "Q: Use defaults to edit preferences Recently, I have been playing around with editing System Preferences without GUI and using the defaults command. I have tried for example:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide NO\n\nThough that did not do anything. The preference was still checked in System Preferences, and the plist did not get edited when I opened it in Xcode. Even after relaunch of Finder and restart. \nAm I using defaults properly? And if no, what is the proper use of it, when I am aiming to edit Preferences through terminal?\n\nI am using OS X Mavericks (10.9.5)\n\nA: Your command is adding a BOOL true or false.\nSo you needed to declare it as such by adding -bool. Otherwise you are changing to a string.\nBut also with this change you need to relaunch the dock for it to pick up the changes. You can do this by adding a second command.\nkillAll Dock\n\nIn one command:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide  -bool no;killAll Dock \n\nThis will run your command and kill any process named Dock. The Dock will then auto relaunch picking up the changes. \n", "Q: Settings for CalendarAgent, Mingler and iCalExternalSync services I have the dreaded issue with recurring sync service processes wreaking havoc on my MacBook Pro with O S X 10.9 Mavericks and stealing my CPU cycles for no apparent good reason. Usually with a 3 month hiatus, strangely enough. It might run most of the times, but it doesn't interfere with heavy workloads in other apps, like music production software. \nCould you please advice where and how to edit the SyncServices of OS X 10.9 Mavericks, so that all spawned sync processes like Mingler and iCalExternalSync are given really low priorities and/or are set to only run at certain time slots? I'm growing really tired of these processes that run even as I've inactivated most accounts, except for email. No Exchange servers to my knowledge are involved.\nIt would also be acceptable to just force these processes to not run when I don't need them running, so I can have my CPU back.\nAs Mingler belong to the SyncServer process and iCalExternalSync belongs to CalendarAgent I've identified likely setting files in com.apple.syncservices.SyncServer.plist and com.apple.CalendarAgentLauncher.plist both in /System/Library/LaunchAgents/, but I see no clear setting to make here in order to stop these processes from running all the time and use more CPU than they deserve. Most likely I need to find a good setting with the effect I want. What could a good setting be to try for this?\n\nA: It's a bit of a workaround, but these unload commands seem to do the trick. I put them in a script that I run when I need more of my CPU:\n#!/bin/bash\nlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.AddressBook.SourceSync.plist\nlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.CalendarAgent.plist\nlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.syncdefaultsd.plist\n\nFor when processes are acceptable, replace \"unload\" with \"load\"\n", "Q: My MacBook Air won't connect to wifi I bought a new MacBook Air and was able to connect to the internet at first but now it won't connect.

I'm looking for a well-supported alternative. I like MercuryMover because it is keyboard-driven, has a HUD that shows me the dimensions and position of the window I'm moving, and has a standard preferences screen for adding custom sizes and positions instead of a text-based configuration file. \nAny suggestions for an alternative?\n\nA: The site has a general options list as well for the window management category at: What Window Management Options exist for OS X?\nFor your specific requirements of keyboard, HUD and non-text preferences, I would select either divvy or moom.

Working Macintosh HD not repairable. Alternatives to backup? I have to say first, I have almost zero experience is the use of Terminal, an usually I'm very careful with what command I use.\nI have tryed to create a bootable Android x86 usb and it was a success, it booted perfectly on a windows pc. I hope it worked on Mac too, sadly it was not.\nBut I immidiatly(usually shut the Mac once a week) discovered, by that boot try, I did something wrong.

In Aperture I understood the process to be that changes made in post processing where stored as \"instructions\" (not sure of real term) to be applied to the original and in that way saved space for storage over iPhoto where it appeared to me that a duplicate copy of the photo was made. \nI'd like to understand what the new Photo does. I would bet the same as iPhoto?\n\nA: For Photos.app, don't consider the edits necessarily edits. While looking through the file architecture one day, I found that what they're doing is storing the original and simply adding layers of \"edits\" which are much more like layers of removable filters. \nThe original stays 100% in tact until you export it to a separate file where Photos will process those layers into an image. \nThe only way you would lose originals and be stuck with the edited versions is if you specifically, in this order:\n\n\n*\n\n*exported your edited version\n\n*deleted the photo from Photos.app\n\n*deleted your Photos.app Trash\n\n*put the exported version back (technically for the first time) into Photos.app.\n\n\nA: Photos.app uses non-destructive edits, meaning that yes, essentially a set of instructions for applying edits is stored alongside the original bitmap, as opposed to duplicating the bitmap with the edits applied. Most likely it is stored as metadata within the file as opposed to a separate file. You can revert to the original at any time.\nYou can also duplicate the image as a kind of \"snapshot\" - any edits made to the point of duplication will be applied to the duplicate image (again, non-destructively), but both the initial image and the duplicated image are still pointing to the same bitmap on disk. Any further edits made to either image will not be reflected in the opposite image, and you can revert either to the unedited original at any time.\n", "Q: Firewall blocks all internet sharing except port 80 MacBook Pro on 10.7.5 (Lion)\nstatic ip 192.168.10.5 using wireless connection\nethernet jack connected to raspberry pi\nraspberry pi has static ip 192.168.2.3\nwhen internet sharing is enabled and firewall is enabled\n-raspberry pi can surf the internet through browser\n-terminal cannot ping macbook, cannot ping any ip on internet\n-macbook can ping raspberry pi\nwhen firewall is disabled\n-terminal can ping macbook, can ping any address on internet\nWhen internet sharing is turned on, is it ONLY sharing port 80?\nHow can I troubleshoot this?\n\nA: I had to disable stealth mode on mac firewall to allow pi to ping mac.\n", "Q: Command line to disconnect or connect 802.1x authentication I have been searching for a terminal command line to disconnect or connect 802.1x authentication, but not the network interface.

The Mail app on my iPhone 5s crashes while launching. I assume that it is trying to restore its last state. Unfortunately that last state was what originally crashed it. So restoring that state results in a Mail app that will always crash on start up. What can I do to prevent the Mail app from restoring its last state on start up?\nI already tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*disabling all Mail accounts\n\n*send myself a mail to launch the Mail app from lock-screen\n\n*closing the Mail app\n\n*rebooting the phone\n\n*contacted Apple support - only to find out that restoring an old backup is the only thing they know will help\n\n\nI do not want to restore from a backup, because it is probably not possible to restore the Mail app backup only.\n\nA: I finally fixed the issue without data loss.

The only problem is, that I was not having any sound even though the drivers were installed. I was told that using Boot Camp to create the USB boot causes that, and that I should use the Windows USB Creation tool.\nI did that today, and I've created a partition on Disk Utility, plugged in the USB stick and it's recognised on my OS X desktop. I checked on Disk Utility, and it's there too. I restarted the computer and presssed ⌥ Option to open Startup Manager, and the USB drive doesn't even show up. \nI installed rEFIt and that did not help. I noticed that it says on Disk Utility that the USB is no longer SMART supported, so could that be a factor? Eventually I'll just have to give in and install Windows via Boot Camp and no longer have sound. \n\nMacbook Pro 2011 13\" (Early) - 10.9.5 (Wiped all my drives using a command in Command Prompt on Windows not realising I'd remove my OS X so that's why I am down graded.)\n\nA: You could try this method to make a bootable disk. Make sure to backup the USB and format as FAT32.\nCreating a bootable USB manually:\nFirst unplug USB and run:\ndiskutil list\n\nTake note of the output. Then plug in your usb and run diskutil list again. You will see that there is one more disk. Of you have only your HD and the usb, it should be /dev/disk1 for you. The command is there to check. \n\nThis is an example of an output. The way you know it is your usb, is that in one of the lines, there will be the name. So Recovery HD and Macintosh HD is the main hard drive. And /dev/disk2 is a USB (Note: This is an example from the Internet, so It might not be a USB. It is just to show you the way it works)\nOnce you defined your USB /dev/disknumber, take note of the path to your iso. Mine would be: /Users/myusername/Desktop/Windows.iso\nThen you run this (Again, make sure you formatted to FAT and backed up!)\nsudo dd if=/Users/yourusername/Desktop/Windows.iso of=/dev/disk2 bs=1m\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Remember to replace yourusername with your username and proper path, and sisk2 with the number of your disk.\n\n*If you get an error with bs, replace 1m with 1M\nInstalling rEFInd (If you cannot see the USB)\nGet rEFInd here.

Because of previous imports, crashes and re-imports, several thousand duplicates (identical pictures - not of the same photo) in my library. Now I would like to identify these and delete them.\nI have upgraded my Duplicate Annihilator from Aperture to Photos but my 56000 photos seem to be to much for it, because they claim that it is Photos API which is causing problems and slowness. \nIs there an other way of finding duplicates and deleting them from my iCloud Library?\n\nA: I had the same problem as you. Here's what I did to remove the duplicates quickly and easily. \n\n\n*\n\n*Export your entire photo library to a folder.\n\n*Close photos and create a new photos library. (No deleting until you know it worked) \n\n*Open that new empty library in photos and drag everything (using CMD+a in finder) in that exported folder to the Photos.app window.\n\n*During the import you will be prompted to choose what you want to have done for duplicate photos and it will show you the first two identical photos that it has found, select \"skip\" and \"apply to all\".\n\n*There you have a full library of purely unique photos.\n\n\nNotes: Since you mentioned you have 5000 photos, the Mac will potentially become a little unresponsive while you're dragging them into the window. Be patient with it and let it do it's thing but it is working. (4,3000 photos was a little stuttery on my 2012 Mac mini i5 but it did work after being patient)\nPhotos may not be able to detect if it already has those photos in the library yet but doing it during the import has proven to be a reliable solution so just be prepared to do a massive import for now.\n\nA: Export and import didn't worked for me. Actually worked but duplicates were not detected. dupeGuru Photo Edition (http://www.hardcoded.net/dupeguru/) helped, recommend it, it's free.\n\nA: Duplicate Annihilator worked great for iPhoto and Aperture, but it looks like their Photos support is still lacking. It may not be feasible to do a good job until a new version of Photos is released with a proper API. I checked and I don't see any alternatives yet.\nBut I'm sure they'll be coming. So, unless you want to run Duplicate Annihilator on iPhoto and then reimport, I would just wait for it to improve.\n", "Q: How do I force-quit an individual app on Apple Watch?

I dont have a credit card, and so I am unable to complete the Apple billing address, which means I can not download anything from the App Store. It there a solution for this?\n\nA: If you want to use an existing Apple ID, you're out of luck. You need a card to be entered and accepted, so you'll have to pay for one or get a friend to trust you to add it and then remove it immediately after confirming your account for the store.\nYou probably also can pay a US bank to provide you with an account and debit card, but that can be more expensive than many find ideal. Many businesses sell addresses as well if you can't use one from an acquaintance.\nYou can usually make a brand new Apple ID following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204034\nIt's generally a bigger pain to have two Apple ID, so I would encourage you to not set up a new ID just to avoid the temporary delay of getting a legitimate address and card for temporary use. \nOnce you have your account verified, you can use store credit for just about everything on the Mac App Store. One note, that if you do this too many times on one device, Apple usually blocks new account creation on that device without a credit card. Unscrupulous people took advantage of that to manipulate app store ratings in the past.\nAlso, lots and lots of relevant details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I download a free app from the App Store without a credit card?\n\n*How to use an existing Apple ID to download free apps from App Store without using Credit Card?\n\n*I have an Apple ID but it is not associated to App Store. I have tried to associate it, but it wont let me without a credit card. How to proceed?\n\n*How do you use an existing AppleID on iOS App Store without providing a credit card number?\n\nA: That's my advice. \nTry to download some apps in your phone like \"Revolut\". This is an app that gives you access to a free virtual credit card (at least now, beginning 2019). Several other exist that give the same service.\nI don't know in which part of the world you live but those accounts have an IBAN and BIC code, so you should be able to load some money in them. I think that as low as 5 USD or 5EUR should be enough.\nOnce you did that, you can complete the AppleID registration with the virtual card data.\nIn this way you'll be sure you won't never spend more that the amount of money you'll initially loaded in the virtual card.\n", "Q: how to use different port for dns on Yosemite?

Now, this is the SSD affected by the notorious performance degradation problem.\nSearching samsung site, I was able to find an upgraded firmware \"for mac users\", but you know that a firmware alone does not solve the issue: data have to be re-copied from decayed cells to fresh cells. This is what Magician software for windows does.\nEdit: But look at this page:\n\nhttp://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/SSD/us/html/support/downloads.html\nUnder \"840 evo firmware for mac\" I read: Supports Advanced\n  Performance Optimization in Magician 4.6, wich should be the\n  performance restoration function. Can someone explain?\n\nHas someone found a way to do performance restoration on a mac?\nThanks. \n\nA: First of all, as you already mentioned, the firmware can be updated on a mac, too. So you do not need windows for that. Here is a Manual. It does not mention 840 EVO, but it should be fine. (Maybe EVO isn't mentioned just because the EVO update came out 30 days later than the non-EVO update and the manual wasn't updated after that?)\nSecondly, not the cells are decayed, only their content is decayed. And this can be fixed by a rewrite of the data. The first firmware update (from October 2014) only modified the algorithm used to read data (trying to compensate the aging of files). As you indicated, this alone does not completely solve the problem. A refresh of the old data was necessary. This is where the Performance Restoration Software came into play. It just does this (a full rewrite) in order to ensure that there are no old files.\nAs it seems, the first firmware update wasn't sufficient and the reading of files got again slower the older the files became.\nWith the second firmware update (in case of 840 EVO it is EXT0DB6Q) Samsung again modified the algorithm but also introduced a recurring (hardware performed) rewrite of all data. Thereby data does not grow old and the explicit Performance Restoration process is not necessary anymore. Instead, the Performance Restoration will be done by the new firmware recurrently when the drive is idle.\nIf you really want the data to be rewritten immediately, you could clone the drive and copy the clone back to it, I guess. But there should be no need for that.\nSource: Various websites, primarily the ssd review. I suggest to give it a read for a deeper understanding. :)\nTo your question regarding the Advanced Performance Optimization let me quote anandtech:\n\nThe new Magician 4.6 also includes an Advanced Performance\n  Optimization feature, which is similar to the performance restoration\n  tool that Samsung released earlier. Basically, it's a command that\n  tells the SSD to rewrite all of its internal data, which resets all\n  cell charges and hence recovers performance. It's merely a\n  supplementary tool as the firmware upgrade itself should be enough to\n  restore performance, but in case the performance isn't fully restored\n  after the firmware upgrade (and some idle time to let the drive\n  refresh the cells), the tool can be used to force a cell charge\n  refresh.\n\n", "Q: Group search results by album in Flickr My photos file names have the date in them e.g. 2015-05-15-123.jpg so when I do a Search in the iOS app for say 2015 I get all photos taken in 2015 but they are shown in a flat list. Is there a way to group them by Album instead?\n\nA: I have checked with version 4.0.1 of the iOS flickr app. I am sorry to say, but it is not possible to group yearly search results by album with this version.

He's not computer literate at all, and YouTUBE from old AppleTV was the best he could do.\nI was thinking of Google Chrome, but I'd like to see a demo of it before purchasing it.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: If he's willing to spend that amount of money then he might as well consider getting the Chromecast. The Chromecast doesn't necessarily work on it's own in the sense that it could work off nothing but a remote but it has an amazingly solid playlist queue that anyone in the house can just sort of throw videos into.\nIf it's just a YouTube experience alone, I can say from experience that the Chromecast to this day is the best YouTube has to offer in terms of user experience.\n", "Q: Convert *stereo* .mov to mono .mp3? I need an easy way to take a stereo .mov file and convert it to a mono .mp3 or similar formatted audio file.\nI use Ecamm's Skype Call recorder to record interviews, which I send out for transcription. The call recorder creates an .mov file with 2 channels--one for each side of the call. The transcription software only plays one channel, so the audio sounds like it's one sided.\nI do this a lot, so I'd like a simple, one-step way to merge the channels and convert the file.\nI've tried ffmpeg, which I like, but I'm only getting one channel when I do this: \nffmpeg -i call.mov -ac 1 call.mp3\n\nAny suggestions? I'd like to use ffmpeg if possible, but a GUI app would be fine as long as it's pretty simple to use.\n\nA: Max (freeware) can drop stereo to mono - though I'm not certain if it will take .mov as input (never tested it).

I understand that it is possible to install Windows 7 through BootCamp (by partitioning the hardrive) on Snow Leopard but is it possible to install OS X Tiger as well? \nI have an install disk for OS X Tiger from (MID -I am assuming) 2005 but I am unsure as to how I would accomplish this. Would this be possible by any means? (legally and within the bounds of Apple's EULA of course)\nMy current OS is OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8.\n\nA: Lion 10.7 was the first consumer Mac OS to be licensed for virtualisation [OS X Server 10.5 was actually the very first]\nNo Mac can boot natively on an OS from before it was manufactured, as the drivers to support that hardware weren't yet invented.\nThere is a distant chance you may be able to get Parallels [list is for current version, not compatible with Snow Leo anyway] to virtualise Tiger [even though it is against the EULA], but I would be doubtful.\nVirtualBox supports Leo & Snow Leo Server, not Tiger.\nIt might be simpler, if not cheaper, to get an old Mac that would run Tiger natively.\n\nA: Not possible, I'm afraid. When Apple releases a new model, they add support (drivers, config info, etc) into the current version of OS X (and release it in the form of a new build or version of OS X). Support for that model is never added into older versions of OS X. As a result, your mid-2010 will not be able to run any version of OS X released before mid 2010.

Does Winebottler support licenses?\n\nA: Generally Winebottler can handle licenses, but it works simulating the Windows API, so you have to fine tuning some components and DLL if something is implemented using non common Windows API / DLL, which it means that sometime license verification is implemented with esoteric business logic and may require some particular DLL which doesn't run well with the emulator. \nIn conclusion, I think that you have a good rate of success because your program is also running as limited edition, and I don't think that it could be a problem to have a test, at least it doesn't works and you can always uninstall it and recover your license key.\nAs far as I know usually licenses are provided per user or per machine.

Specifically, I just purchased a fully refurbished iMac G5 and I am interested in playing several old games on it (most likely Marble Blast Gold and Knights of the Old Republic). Although I know the games will run well on the computer, I am wondering if (generally) running graphics intensive programs will decrease the life expectancy of an iMac (specifically with regards to an iMac G5 Mid 2005 Model) in both the short and long run.\nWill frequently running graphic/hardware intensive programs harm (in the long run) an older iMac?\nNote- I am not looking for an opinion or subjective account, just some level of reasoning behind why it would or would not impact the computer (i.e. thermal paste wears down, processor runs to hot overtime, etc...) \nI am still new at this so if my question is to vague or opinion based let me know and I can change it.\n\nA: Mac hardware is designed to handle its maximum load without being compromised, so theoretically the answer is no. \nIn practice, as everything electronics or mechanical, if you push towards its limits you machine, every parts of its is subjected to major load and stress.\nWide variation in temperature can provide degradation to silicon properties and may cause failure or T-junction breakages if the hardware temperature watcher doesn't switch off CPU in time. The same is true for GPU. \nFrom the point of view of HDD and SSD, they have a limited number of writes, and they are very sensible to temperature variation. In fact if you expose for long periods an SSD to temperature higher than 50 degrees, this can half is life. \nMoreover, the more energy you hardware require the more fast you battery will drain, and the more often you have to reload the battery. Here you are contributing to increment the battery load cycles. Batteries have a limited lifetime before they lose their load capacity (it's around 900 cycles). \n", "Q: Maximum size drive for Mac OS X 4 TB = 1.8 TB ?\nWhat is the maximum size drive that can be used with various versions of Mac OS X?\nOn a white Intel MacBook running Mac OS X 10.6.x, the Disk Utility app recognizes a new Seagate 4 TB (terabyte) drive as 1.8 TB when attached via FireWire in a NewerTech Voyager \"pop-tart\" style drive holder.\n\nA: SATA Controller\nI had something similar happen to me and I seem to recall it was not so much the O/S as it was the controller in the drive caddy.\nThe drive is probably SATA 3 and the drive caddy is probably a SATA 2. And there are limitations to drive size in various versions of SATA. If you got a drive caddy with a SATA 3 controller (to USB) and plugged it into your Mac it would likely show all 4 TB.\nMac OS X Volume Limits\nYour version of Mac OS X supports drive sizes up to ~8 EB (Exabytes). \nSee this Apple technical note, Mac OS X: Mac OS Extended format (HFS Plus) volume and file limits.\n", "Q: Replace an iMac superdrive with one pulled from a Macbook Pro? I have an old Mid 2009 13\" MacBook Pro (unibody) that I'm not using anymore. I've already pulled the superdrive out of it. \nI also have a 2009 27\" iMac that I am using. The superdrive on it is no longer working for various reasons, and needs to be replaced. I'm comfortable opening the iMac and replacing it, I've done it before.\nCan I use the drive from my '09 Pro in my iMac?\n\nA: This issue is likely form factor more than anything else, though Apple is famous for custom connectors...\nI would look through the take-a-parts on fixit.com on those two units and see if they look the same. \nAlso a bit of googling for a replacement drive for both and seeing if the part numbers are the same.\n\nA: Simply; if it fits & has the same connectors [or you can find alternatives in the machine] you can use it. \nApple transitioned from PATA to SATA for Superdrives later than for HDs, though I'm not sure when that transition was completed.\nMy 08 Mac Pro uses PATA for the Superdrive, SATA for the HDs - so I found a spare SATA port inside & wired it across to a brand new SATA Superdrive. I used a simple PATA>SATA power cable converter & added it to the existing power.\nNew drive is ⅓ the thickness of the old one, but still matches to the slot - so all is fine.\nHowever, you can't go the other way; you can't patch a PATA drive into an SATA machine.   \nIf it comes to buying a new one… PATA Superdrives are about $100 - ouch!\nSATA equivalents you can get for about $15.\n", "Q: Questions regarding disk format I'm doing a fresh install of Yosemite on my mac, but stopped at format step: I noticed various options:\n\n\n*\n\n*plain format\n\n*encrypted\n\n*case sensitive\n\n\nSo, I'd like to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to install Yosemite on an encrypted partition? If\n   yes, there are downsides?\n\n*Is this equivalent to installing on unencrypted disk and perform\nencryption from OS with FileVault? If not, may you explain the\ndifference?\n\n*I'm tempted to choose Case Sensitive to have a more \"true Unix\"\nenvironment. May this cause issues with OS and apps?\n\n\nI googled, but those answers are rather difficult to find.\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: You can install Yosemite on an encrypted partition. To use encryption, you also have to use core storage. If you do not use encryption, then the use of core storage is optional. If you encrypt after installing without core storage, then a conversion to core storage will take place. Fusion drives require the use of core storage. Yosemite can only be installed on a partition that is case insensitive. Personally, I have avoided using core storage. I do not see any advantages to using it unless you have to.\n", "Q: Issues with Boom Beach and Clash of Clans My dad and I share an Apple ID (even though I've asked him time and time again to get his own for this reason). I accidentally clicked on both games my dad's account that is on his iPad and now I can't get to my own account. I have tried logging out of the Game Center and logging back in but neither will prompt to switch to my game. I also tried deleting it off my iPhone 6 and clearing it from the Game Center then re-download them and they both just pop up under my dad's account. Any advise to get my account back? Or start a new one?\n\nA: Apps such as Boom Beach and Clash of Clans use Game Center by default, the only way to force it to not use the Game Center account is to temporarily sign out of Game Center then start the app after a clean install. If your old account was not bound to either Facebook or Game Center, there is no definite way to recover it, but you can try by following these steps: http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki/Recovering_a_lost_village_that_wasn%27t_linked_to_GC_or_GPlus\n", "Q: Does iOS 8.3 break audio line out over lightning cable? I have a charger in my car that also has an audio line out (I've used a gsm iPhone 5 with this, currently I use a cdma iPhone 5s ).  For the past several years it has worked great.  I connect the audio out to my car stereo, and connect the lightning cable to my phone.  My phone then charges and plays audio to the car simultaneously.  After updating to 8.3 the phone will only play out of its tiny speaker which is not really audible while driving.  \nI've tried a \"Reset All Settings\", and power cycled many times.  I've tried several different audio playing apps.  The tell tale thing I've noticed is that in the past when I connected the device, the audio volume \"goes away\" because iPhone audio line out doesn't have any volume adjustment option.  Now when I plug in the lightning cable, the volume option never goes away.\nI'm considering purchasing bluetooth audio or other solutions, but I'd really like this to just work like it has for years!  Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated!\n--\nI realized I have an iPad2 which can also connect to my car audio/charger, and it properly plays audio, and it updated to iOS 8.3?!  Unfortunately there is a hardware difference, because my car charger is the old school 30pin connecter, so it could be that my 30pin to lightning adapter died at the same time iOS 8.3 came out?\n\nA: The answer is no.  Turns out my lightning adapter partially broke the same day I installed iOS 8.3  I went to the apple store with the adapter and they offered a free exchange for a new one, replaced, and there was once again the sound of podcasts in my car :-)\n", "Q: Troubleshoot Dock behaviour in Mac Yosemite When I right-click the Downloads folder in the dock, and select Open \"Downloads\", instead of the expected thing happening, an app launches.\nThe app is one I created myself using Automator. And it is on the Desktop. I can move it anywhere and rename it, but this doesn't fix the problem.\nOther steps taken to resolve:\n\n\n*\n\n*reboot -> not fixed\n\n*switch user to guest account -> fixed\n\n*delete the app -> fixed\n\n*zip the app, delete the original -> fixed\n\n*unzip the app -> unfixes itself!\n\n\nMight be relevant:\n\n\n*\n\n*I use Quicksilver, but behaviour occurs even when QS is not running\n\n\nSystem info: Yosemite 10.10.3\nWhy is this is a problem? Because I want to create Automator apps without them being launched by right-clicking the downloads folder in the dock.\nEdit: This is the workflow of the app that launches:\n\n\nA: Answer for my own question...\nI mistakenly changed the default application for opening folders (!) away from Finder to an application of my own creation. I didn't know this was even possible! Needless to say this had some weird side effects, like the problem I originally described. But I figured it out – I mucked up my system with an erroneous QuickSilver command.\nI'm always creating dated folders, so I created an Automator app that, given the current folder, would create a folder within using the date as the name.\nWhen teamed with QuickSilver's \"Current Selection\" trigger, the app becomes useful. I can call my \"create-dated-folder.app\" from the current folder, using \"Open with...\" in Quicksilver's second pane, and my app in the third. Works great.\nMy mistake was, instead of \"Open with\", I once chose \"Always Open With\", which changed system settings I didn't know existed – it changed the default application for the \"public.folder\" UTI from Finder to my Automator app. Then the weirdness began, like if I chose \"Open Examples Folder\" from Automator's help menu, my app would be invoked. I really had no idea what was going on!\nBrilliant tip from to Tetsujin who suggested RCDefaultApp would be worth investigating.\n", "Q: Can I extract the body of an email message using Automator without an AppleScript?

(time constraints)\nThanks for looking\n\nA: You do not need a script or Automator for that.\nClick on the email of interest and use the shift+cmd+s\nThat will bring up a window where you can now save that email as plain text in a location of your choice.\nYou could set up a Rules in Mac mail to get it better organized in a single folder for example.\nIf you want the system to find (filter) the emails and save as plain text and do that automatically for you then you need Automator and a script.\n\nA: Yes, but still only (* Catalina era) if you use \"Run JavaScript\" (or Shell Script) instead of \"Run AppleScript\".\nUsing the \"Run JavaScript\" option, a complete download-email-bodies automator recipe can look like this:\n* Get Specified Mail Items\n    [mailbox \"Important\" of account \"Google\"]\n\n* Filter Mail Messages\n    [Date Received] [is today]\n\n* Run JavaScript\n    function run(input, parameters) {\n        return input.map(m => m.content());\n    }\n\n* New Text File\n\n(You'd presumably tuck on your own actions at the end, instead of saving them all to a text file.)\n", "Q: To prevent text wrap in TexPad editor I did not find anywhere such an option. \nI do not want this\n\nHow can you prevent text wrap in TexPad editor?\n\nA: You cannot. \nI switched to TextMate which is much more sufficient for my needs. \nSome review about integrated editors here where some open sourcing of the excellent editors has happened.\n", "Q: Does my MacBook have malware? Frozen screen and Automatic Clock Reset on Macbook Pro I like to download books and games on the internet and so my MacBook Pro had acquired some malware. I did not know this, but eventually I installed Avast. It detected that I had acquired a couple of adware and I deleted them. Recently, I performed a full system scan and found 13 infected files. The names of the adware/malware I found were (found some of them in several places):\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac-OS-Genieo-V [Adw]\n\n*Win32:PUP-gen [PUP]\n\n*Win32:Malware-gen\n\n*MacO...K[PUP]\n\n*… and several others I can't recall.\n\n\nI do not know if they have been eradicated, for I did not follow any steps to ensure they are wiped clear from the hard drive—unsure if it was necessary. But then, yesterday, my notebook froze, while I was on Safari. I had not left many programs running, but my physical memory was around 3.99 GB of 4 GB, like it is right now. I was looking up about viruses and adware and clicked on a link, when my screen froze. The mouse neither the keyboard responded. I have recently purchased this computer, last year, and it is not even a year old. So I tried pressing escape (Windows) and a bunch of random keys but it did not work. When I closed it, even then the display lingered on. Finally I gave up and left it till its battery drained away. After a few hours, when I plugged in the charger, it started up normally.\nBut then, today morning, when I opened Safari, it claimed that Google's certificate was not yet valid. Previosly,this had happened a couple of times. Then I checked the certificate to see that it was validated by April 5th 2015.

I've used http://screenr.com/ before but for company things it's not appropriate since it becomes public. I need something that lets me record my screen and gives me a small well encoded file that I put into dropbox.\nWhat's my options?\n\nA: Actually, with Mojave, you can just press Command-Shift-5 and select to record either a single screenshot, or a screen recording.\n\n(Picture taken from https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/take-screenshots-in-macos-mojave/ which also offers more details on how it works)\n\nA: Update Jan 2020: You can no longer choose screen recording quality up-front in Mojave, unfortunately.

I choose video output resolution of 1440x900 againt my MacBook input resolution of 2880x1800. This will generate decent quality and file size is very low compared to the Quicktime player.\nIt is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.\n\nA: Quicktime\nYou can use QuickTime Player to record everything that happens on your computer’s screen or on a portion of your computer’s screen, along with your narration, if you’d like.

I bought a MacBook Air 13.3″ i7 8 GB RAM 128 GB SSD (early 2014) some months ago and found out that the 128 GB are definitely not enough!\nTo somehow rectify my problem I though of buying a fast external HD, make it bootable and do everything from there (I need the space on my startup disk because of the big iTunes collection, at least 500 MB).\nIn order not to slow down the whole computer too much I’m not sure if I'd better buy an external SSD1 with USB3 or a Thunderbolt 1 disk (for some reasons there are no SSD1 with Thunderbolt). The transfer speed is faster on the Thunderbolt but there might be other problems involved with it, I don’t know, The original disk on the mac is a flash storage, so maybe SSD1 via USB3?\nI add here two examples of these external HDs I’m talking about in order to make the comparison easier, maybe some of you might give me some good advice.\nSSD1:\nhttp://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/SSD/global/html/portablessdt1/specifications.html\nThunderbolt:\nhttp://www.buffalotech.com/products/portable-hard-drives/portable-hard-drives/ministation-thunderbolt\n\nA: My personal recommendation would be not to move the OS to external drive as you would have to carry it around just to make the computer run.\nI recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move all the files that you only need slow access to but are GB-eating to iCloud or similar network location. (For example: iTunes Library, Photos, Movies…)\n\n*Get a Thunderbolt drive for applications that need speed.

It can automatically synchronise the files in a given project to a folder. Essentially, it will place into the folder a bunch of files whenever it syncs (on opening and closing, and manually). Any changes to that folder are automatically synced to my Android device.\nHowever, I need them to be converted to .mmd files before that happens, and converted back to RTF when the files come in changed (or new) from the Android device.\nSo here is what I have in mind. What I would like is to set things up in such a way that when files are synchronised from the Mac app to their target folder, those files are automatically converted from RTF to MMD. I already have the scripts that will do the the actual conversion. AND when the MMD files change, they will be automatically converted to RTF files. I also have a script for this.\nThe questions I have are these:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I automatically monitor a folder for changes to its content, and run a script if files change in that folder?\n\n*How could I make this work two-ways, without throwing everything into an endless loop? At first I thought I could do the following:\n\n\nTwo-way conversion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create two folders on the Mac. One is for RTF files, the other is for MMD files.\n\n*Set up the Mac app to sync its data out and in from the RTF folder\n\n*Set the the Mac to Android sync system (Dropbox, Bittorrent Sync, etc.) to sync content of MMD folder with a folder on Android device.\n\n*When content of RTF folders changes, convert the files to MMD and put output into the MMD folder. AND vice versa.\n\n\nBut, obviously, this will create an endless loop, because each action will trigger the reverse action, endlessly.\nOne possible way around this endless loop might be this:\n\n\n*\n\n*RTF folder has script R assigned to it. When content changes, script R executes.\n\n*MMD folder has script M assigned to it. When content changes, script M executes.\n\n*When a change is detected in RTF folder, the first thing script R does is disable script M from triggering. The last thing script R does before exiting is enable script M again. That way M won't 'notice' that the folder contents were changing whilst R was updating its content with freshly converted files.\n\n*The same would apply in reverse.\n\n\nBut maybe there's a better way?\nI am keen to learn more about scripting, and in the process resolve this problem.\nAre there any people with feasible ideas on how to achieve what I am hoping to work out here?\n\nA: I would create one script that monitors both folders. My language of choice for this is Python. AppleScript is not terribly well-suited to this kind of operation. The basic idea is to listen for FSEvents on the two folders in question, and when one occurs, quickly unschedule the event stream for the other folder, do some conversion and sync operation, then reschedule the previously unscheduled event stream.\nThe completed script, downloaded here, with modified versions of those scripts you showed me. The MacFSEvents installation is now automatic: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/oylvewk90ezwb3s/File%20Sync.app.zip?dl=1\nHere are the steps to use it:\nExtract the applet, right click on it and select \"Show Package Contents\", open Contents, and Resources, then edit the plist inside with your RTF and MMD folder pairings. You will be able to specify as many pairs as you need to keep synchronized with each other, just stick to the same format as what I used in the plist: One array per pair, each containing two items, the first item being the path to the RTF folder, the second being the path to the MMD folder. You'll see this when you open the plist.\nThis should work without any issues. The folders will now be watched for any sort of modification, and will have the files converted and transferred to the other folder.\n\nA: I'm all for people learning how to script things, but for day to day use and flexibility, reimplementing parts of Hazel by NoodleSoft is less powerful and efficient for a general purpose solution.\n\nAgain, kudos to Froggard and Inspired Life for the excellent answer and the practical question.\n", "Q: How to make the login window display list of users and name and password?

It doesn't change the color of the label, but the color of the folder icon itself. That does the job for me to separate more important things from the lesser important ones - at least on the Desktop.\nThis only works for folders and not for documents, of course. But it might fill the void left by Apple's strange decisions partially.\nI also would love the get the old label colours back, the little dots are hardly useful and especially hard to see from a distance.\n\nA: Are you kidding. Once Apple takes away, it never comes back. But you can use TotalFinder or, a more elaborate solution, PathFinder, to get the label color for the folder and full row instead of that weeny little tag color dot. \nAnd there are little apps about, such as Colored Folder Creator from '08. that kinda still work ... it doesn't color the whole row, but ....\n", "Q: How to send email from \"different accounts\" in Outlook iOS app (Outlook.com account)? And by \"different accounts\" I mean other email addresses (and aliases) that have been setup as send (or send/recieve) accounts within the one outlook.com account.\nFor example, within my <me>@outlook.com account at outlook.com I have configured the following accounts/email addresses from which I can send email, one of which is set as the default:\n\n\n*\n\n*<me>@example.com (Default)\n\n*<me>@example.org\n\n*<me>@example.net\nHowever, when composing a new email on the Outlook iOS app I can only select from other accounts I have setup with the iOS app itself (by tapping in the \"From\" field).\nOn the Android Outlook.com app (and on the website) I can easily select from any of the above accounts/email addresses, as well as select the default account from which to send (in settings). However, on the iOS app, I cannot find this information anywhere, nor the ability to select the default account?\nThe Default account: However, when I send email from <me>@outlook.com in the iOS app it does \"magically\" send it from my default account (ie. <me>@example.com)! However, there is no indication of this in the iOS app (it simply shows <me>@outlook.com in the \"From\" field) and there does not appear to be anywhere to configure this - as far as I can tell?\nUsing the latest versions... iOS 8.3, Outlook App 1.1.9\nSo, in summary, when using an Outlook.com account in the Microsoft Outlook iOS app:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you send From other addresses (and _aliases) configured for this account?\n\n*How do you configure the default send From address for this account?\n\n\nA: I ran into this post while doing some research.\nI think this works now, but if you add your aliases after you added your outlook account to the app i think you have to add them manually in the app. At least that was what i had to do.\nAnd they need to be connected in outlook.com as well.\n\nA: Unfortunately, after trudging through the multitude of comments on the MS Office Blog page requesting the same missing feature, and checking every option in the current version of the Outlook iOS app with a fine tooth comb, it seems this \"feature\" is still not available for Outlook.com accounts in the Outlook iOS app!\n\nAllenFilush_MSFT: (4 months ago)\n  This is on the list of future items to support, to match the functionality of the Outlook.com app. For the moment, you should continue to use Outlook.com app if aliases are a key part of your daily email patterns, until we add to Outlook.\n\nUnfortunately the Outlook.com app is only available on Android as far as I can tell. I certainly can't find it in the App store for iPad or iPhone?\n\nAllenFilush_MSFT: (3 months ago)\n  at the moment this is not supported, but a feature we are planning to add in a future release.

I guess I don't have a mind that works like the authors of the Finder application. If you are used to using commands you can try the following. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal application window.\n\n*Use the cd command to change to the base folder where the files\nare. The command pwd will give your current folder.\n\n*Enter to the command\nfind . -name \"filesToFind\" -print\n\nand the current base folder and all subfolders will be searched.\nFor example to find all files ending the .txt on your desktop, open a Terminal window and type:\ncd desktop\nfind . -name \"*.txt\" -print\n\nNote: The instructions for the find command can be found by typing the command man find or at this link.\n\nA: To find (jpg,png,svg) you can type:\nfind . -name \"*.**g\" -print\n\n", "Q: Switching apps: how to show just one window? I've noticed one thing that annoys me about switching apps using the dock - if I have say, 5 different PDFs and 5 Firefox windows open, sometimes I'd like to switch back and forth between one pdf and one Firefox window.  If I click the app icons on the dock, it brings all the windows for that app forward.  Is there a way to force it to only bring the most recently active window forward?  I've developed workarounds of course, but it'd be nice to have this.\nI'm using Mavericks, if it makes a difference. \nThanks!\n\nA: There's dreadfully few tweaks that can be applied to Dock, and none of the ones I know can modify the behavior of a single click on an app icon. What I would do in this situation is to assign a special gesture, say a four-finger click, to an applescript. The applescript will perform the task you want, which, in this case, is to bring up only the current window of the app under cursor.\nTo do this, you don't know need to know how to write a script - the script is here. You however need to know how to create custom gestures, enable Accessibility, etc. The best way to do this is the app BetterTouchTool.\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"Dock\" to tell list 1\n    set targetDockIcon to first UI element whose value of attribute \"AXSubrole\" ¬\n    is not \"AXSeparatorDockItem\" and its value of attribute \"AXSelected\" is true\n    tell targetDockIcon to perform action \"AXShowMenu\"\n    tell (first menu item whose value of attribute \"AXMenuItemMarkChar\" is \"✓\") of ¬\n    menu 1 of targetDockIcon to perform action \"AXPress\"\nend tell\n\nThis script essentially find the app icon under cursor, right-click it for you, and click the window item with a check mark to its left. You will see the contextual menu flash for a brief second.\n\nThis script is tested on Yosemite.\n\nA: If you click on the Dock representation of the application, it will do exactly that: Activate the application.\nThis means (tested on Yosemite with TextEdit and Mail):\n\n\n*\n\n*if the application is not active\n\n*\n\n*it will be launched/started.\n\n\n*if the application is active\n\n*\n\n*all non-minimized windows will be presented to you in the foreground\n\n*and only have minimized windows, the window you opened first will be shown, leaving all other minimized windows in the Dock.\n\n*[Mail] if the main window is closed and you minimized a message reader or editor, the main window will be shown, leaving the message reader/editor minimized in the Dock\n\n\n\nAn answer to your question may be a third-party product, namely HyperDock.  It's not free, but as of this writing tagged at EUR 6.95 still reasonably priced and you can test it free for 15 days.\nAfter having it installed, it shows available windows above the Dock's application's icon when hovering over it with the mouse similar to Windows Aero.  Clicking a window instead of the Dock item will bring this window to the front only.\n\nA: CMD+tab does that too, switches between two most recent windows.\n", "Q: My iPad won't text to phone numbers my iPad Air 2 used to text to all apple products and now I can only text to iPods and iPads that use email.

I don't have the power brick for my Mac mini with me but I have cord that plugs into the back of it, can I use it without and plug directly into the wall? Any harm?\nThe model is A1347\n\nA: If it's a 2005-2009 model then NO! You absolutely cannot plug directly from a AC power source to a computer that does not have a built in transformer power supply, which the Mac mini 2005-2009 model does not have.  The AC current must be converted to DC current first and that is what the Mac mini's power supply does.\nStarting in 2010 the Mac mini used a built-in power supply and the power cord does not use a power brick like in previous modles, it plugs directly from wall to computer.\n\n\n\nA: Only if you want it to go Bang & never work again.\nThe plug design ought to be such that you cannot even do it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make iCloud Photo library read only on iPad? I would like to give my daughter access to my complete iCloud library on her iPad. The only problem I see is that she might accidentally deleting Photos. Is there any kind of access restriction would make this scenario safe?\n\nA: Photos has a \"Recently Deleted\" album. Whenever a photo is deleted, it goes into that album, where you have 30 days to restore it before it disappears forever. If you trust your daughter to not delete photos from the main library and then discover that album and manually delete the photos, all you'll have to do is check the Recently Deleted album regularly and you'll be fine!\n", "Q: Export unmodified originals from Photos.app and NOT creating duplicates I have all my photos in Photos.app. I also maintain them in Dropbox.\nMy workflow is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Import from camera/iPhone into Photos\n\n*Organize photos into albums - some into new albums, some into existing albums.\n\n*Export unmodified originals from Photos to a folder structure that matches the album layout in Photos using File > Export > Export Unmodified Original\n\n\nNew albums are easy. Exporting the entire album is no problem since they are all new files. If I add images to an existing Photos album, I'd like to be able to simply export all of the photos in that album to the Dropbox folder.

I'm thinking about buying a refurbished iMac that has a 1 Tb fusion drive. Is it possible to replace the stock HDD with a 3 Tb drive?\n\nA: The fusion part is not contained in the drive. There is a separate connector for the SSD on the logic board. You can definitely replace the hard drive with a larger one once you buy it.\nFusion Drive is a marketing term for what's known under the hood as CoreStorage, the technology which, among other things, can combine two drives into one. Apple doesn't pull any hardware tricks to implement this. It's 100% software-based. They have a connector (albeit somewhat proprietary) for the SSD, and another connector for the HDD.

Click on the disk, go into the \"partition\" tab, set it from \"Current\" to \"1 Partition\", click \"Options\", change the partition table to anything else, then repeat the process and set it back. If the issue is the partition table, that will fix it. If the issue is the drive, then it won't. Either way, you'll have your answer.\n\nA: For the reference of others: if you're absolutely sure it's the partition map that's damaged, after backing up the drive you could use fdisk in a Linux virtual machine to verify it. Something like sudo fdisk /dev/sdb and then v verifies the partition map.

of very risky component of the kernel coming from the disk, the first hypothesis to kill is a corrupted file system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your boot partition with Disk Utility.\nIf errors appear, repair it, and reboot.\n\n*Check for extension problem:\nReboot your Mac without extensions: OS X Yosemite: Start up in safe mode\nIf you don't hear the boot chime sound, just press the ⇧ shift 3 seconds after the power on button. Keep it depressed until you see the dark grey progression bar showing the extensions, cache and kernel reorganization in progress.\nCheck if the sound is OK.\nIf yes, start the hunt for the bad extension.\nIf not, you have an hardware problem. Bring your Mac to Apple.\n\n*Check for extension, cache or kernel corruption:\nVerify if the audio kernel extensions are actually loaded:\nkextstat | egrep 'Index|Audio'\n\nYou should get an output very similar (but the hex address field) to this:\n$ kextstat | egrep 'Index|Audio'\nIndex Refs Address            Size       Wired      Name (Version) <Linked Against>\n       95    4 0xffffff7f81603000 0x30000    0x30000    com.apple.iokit.IOAudioFamily (203.3) <94 5 4 3 1>\n      196    0 0xffffff7f82c24000 0x5000     0x5000     com.apple.driver.AudioAUUC (1.70) <95 76 12 11 7 5 4 3 1>\n$\n\nIf you don't have these 2 extensions loaded, you will take advantage of this default to load them in a mode where you will see what is going wrong (i.e. what is usually hidden behind the nice spinning beach balloon®).\nTo manually reload a missing extension and to take advantage of this manual operation to better understand the origin of the bad, here is how to proceed:\n/usr/bin/sudo kextutil -t -v 6 -b com.apple.driver.AudioAUUC\n\nwhich loads the kernel extension com.apple.driver.AudioAUUC\n-b identify it with its bundle name,\n-t print diagnostics,\n-v 6 will be as verbose as possible about every steps of this process.\nAt the end of this verbose kernel extension loading, check that the kernel has loaded this extension:\nkextstat -b com.apple.driver.AudioAUUC\n\n\nA: It could be hardware related: plug a headphone into the computer and make sure it really connects. Disconnect it and reboot. I had a MacMini with defect audio and this helped to get it up for a while. If no startup sound appears, try the same again but let the headphone plugged in. Experiment with this.\nNote: When no startup chime appears, it probably means that the audio hardware couldn't get initialized and everything software related can't change a thing since the audio driver has no connection to the hardware.\n", "Q: Is there a peak RAM age? I'm using a MacBook Pro upgraded to 8GB of RAM. I have an app called Memory Clean in my menu bar that shows how much unused RAM is available. Recently, (about 9 months since RAM installed) I noticed an increase in the amount of free RAM available. Is there such a thing as a \"peak\" in the efficiency (I don't think that's the right word to use) of RAM over time? Or is it just because of software updates?\n\nA: Free RAM is wasted RAM. What you want is a large amount of Inactive Memory (called file cache these days), which helps to speed up your computer incase those files are accessed again. I'm sure you think you're speeding up your computer by \"cleaning\" it, but the only time that's useful is when you've just used a RAM-heavy application that you are certain to not want to relaunch in the near future. Otherwise, there is no benefit, and indeed you are slowing down your overall experience due to not having that file cache sitting around for future use. OS X will use as much RAM as it has access to. Typically, a large portion of it is cache, and so will be freed the moment an app needs it.\n", "Q: Set Bash Variable as Icon in osascript -e Display Dialog with icon I have a bash script that utilizes some osascript -e code for a dialog. I want to use a custom icon in that dialog. However, I don't understand how to code it so it's completely portable so as to make it executable no matter where a user may put it in his file system.\n\ncd \"$(dirname \"$0\")/../../\"\nCONTENTS=\"$PWD\"\nexport ICNSPATH=\"$CONTENTS/Resources/path/to/icon/Myicon.icns\"\nosascript -e 'tell application id \"com.apple.systemuiserver\"' -e 'display dialog \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\" buttons {\"Cancel\", \"Okay\"} with icon '$ICNSPATH' as alias' -e 'end tell'\n\nCurrently the only way I can get it to work with a custom icon is by hard coding it and I don't think it is a good idea.\n\nSolutions should be w/o add-ons and must work on Mac OSes 10.6 - 10.10.\nAppreciate any help you can render.\n\nA: What always will work is encoding the icon file with base64 -b 64 (to keep the lines short enough), include it into your shell script as a here document and decode it on the fly.\nTo create a base64 encoded version of your icon file, run\nbase64 -b 64 -i path/to/icon/Myicon.icns > myicon.base64\n\n(This you only need to do once).\nThen open your shell script in your editor and insert myicon.base64 (which might be rather big) in the correct spot \n...\nICNSPATH=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/icon.$$.icns\nbase64 -D -o $ICNSPATH <<\"END_OF_ICON\"\n** replace with content of myicon.base64 **\nEND_OF_ICON\n\nosascript -e '... with icon '$ICNSPATH' as alias' # write full command here\nrm -f $ICNSPATH\n\nThe final script will then look like the following \n...\nICNSPATH=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/icon.$$.icns\nbase64 -D -o $ICNSPATH <<\"END_OF_ICON\"\naG93IHRvIGNvZGUgaXQgc28gaXQncyBjb21wbGV0ZWx5IHBvcnRhYmxlIHNvIGFz\n...\neSBwdXQgaXQgaW4gaGlzIGZpbGUgc3lzdGVtLgoK\nEND_OF_ICON\n\nosascript -e '... with icon '$ICNSPATH' as alias'\nrm -f $ICNSPATH\n\n", "Q: Textmate's Filter Through Command I run anything there on document or selection I get \n\n/bin/sh: pandoc: command not found\n\n\nI installed pandoc by brew install pandoc \nMy pandoc's version is 1.13.2.1. \nThere is probably something broken in my $PATH. \nEcho $PATH gives /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/texbin. \nBoth my $HOME/.profile and $HOME/.bashrc have export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 only. \nDoing ls -1 /bin/sh gives /bin/sh so existing.\nWhy does this error message come? \n\nA: Solution here. \nClick the box in settings for $PATH\n\n", "Q: Using same Apple ID with two of our phones, can they be linked My boyfriend and I are using the same Apple ID on both of our phones. I just want know how can I link my phone to his?\n\nA: Without jailbreak no.\nEven if you're using the same Apple ID on both devices, you can't get the same SMS and call (and also call logs) of the other device, because this two things depends from the telephone number and they're recorded on the device that received the message / call.\nProbably you'll get the iMessage on both devices because they works differently, so every device logged with the same ID will get all the messages, but deletion are not synchronized.\nApple ID is used to keep settings, app and profile settings synced across Apple devices.\n", "Q: Turning off Find My iPhone I just got a new iPhone 6. I synced it to my computer through the last backup I had saved from my old phone. Unfortunately, at the time I was using a different Apple ID, and this ID no longer exists. I want to sync it to my new Apple ID, but first I have to turn off Find My iPhone using the old ID. I can't do this because it no longer exists, but it still asks for the password. \nI've tried entering in old passwords and sending an email to reset the password, but none of it works.\n\nA: You'll need to take your iPhone along with the sales receipt to an Apple store.\n\nA: Apple IDs are never deleted. So try to reset the AppleID password first. Then remove the old iPhone from that account. After that use the new Apple ID with iPhone 6.\n", "Q: iCloud slideshow - shuffle photos I am creating a slideshow for an event that individuals are adding to a shared album on iCloud. I would like to shuffle the photos. How do I do that?\n\nA: It would depend on what device you are viewing the photos.\nIn case of iPhone:\nTo view slides in random order (shuffle) turn the shuffle on.\n\n", "Q: Get alerted whenever someone uses your Mac? I have a dedicated Mac Mini in a colocation that I access via Remote Desktop. I trust the colocation provider, but I don't trust my password is secure enough. Without resorting to a more secure password, is there an app that alerts me via E-mail or Push Notification via OS X server whenever the mouse moves on the Mac?\n\nA: I found an article on Macworld that suggested two apps: \nHidden \nUndercover\nTheir pricing is quite different. Undercover charges $49 for unlimited use on 1 device, while Hidden charges $2.50/month for 3 devices. If you want a free option, I think Mackeeper's Anti-Theft feature is free, but I don't trust them.\nUpdate: I found a free app called Prey which looks much more legit than Mackeeper.\n", "Q: How to delete Google apps from my launchpad?

Is this a known issue with a fix or work-around available?\n\nA: Outlook uses a non-unicode wingdings font to represent the smiley, instead of the Unicode standard smiley which everyone agreed to use 5 years ago.\nUntil MS changes its app to conform to the standard, the only fix is to ask the sender of such emails to delete the autocorrect entries in Outlook which replace things like :-) with a single wingdings character.\n", "Q: Stop iPhone from sending iMessages to OS X I recently got an iMac and I set up that my photos and music from my iMac get downloaded to my iPhone. \nBut now my messages on my iPhone are getting sent to my iMac.

How do I stop iMessages from my Phone going to my Mac?\n\nA: Go to Messages on your Mac, open Preferences (in the menu bar, it's Messages > Preferences), click on Accounts, click on your Apple ID in the list of messaging accounts, and uncheck \"Enable this account.\"\n", "Q: Why do iPhone photos have Microsoft in Exif data? Wandering around Spain, I took a lot of pictures with an iPhone 5s, latest IOS. \nUploaded into the new Photos (which is IMHO a step backward from iPhoto).\nDragged from Photos into a directory, and viewed tags with exiftool.  Puzzled by this one in every image:\nPrimary Platform                : Microsoft Corporation\n\nWhat does it mean/why is it in images that came from an iPhone and (AFAIK) has not been created by, stored on, or passed through any software or hardware from Microsoft?\nAgain, I took all these photos with an iPhone 5s and all changes (if any) were made by Apple's new but not improved Photos app.\n\nA: \"Primary Platform\" is part of the ICC profile, which is related to colorspace. Under \"Device Model\" and \"Colorspace\", you should see sRGB, which was created jointly by Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard (HP). If you look further you should also see the color profile is listed as being created by, and copyrighted to, HP.\nIt appears that somewhere along the line, the color profile is being added to the image. It's not clear if this is on iOS (which I've seen claims stating it is not color-managed), during the move to Mac or in iPhoto/Photos. I have images that were in iPhoto and copied back out, and have not been touched by Photos, that have the same Exif data. I have also used the Photo Investigator app on iPhone to view Exif data for images that were taken on iPhone but have not yet been transferred to a computer, and they list the Color Model as RGB, not sRGB, so it would appear the profile is added later.\n", "Q: flac terminal app no longer works - giving me libogg.0.dylib errors I've been a happy user of flac on the OS X Terminal.

For example, The Pirate Bay or EZTV - when you click to scroll, they will open a new tab to show you ads.\n\nA: I suggest to download and run Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware for Mac. It will detect most adwares and remove them automatically.\nAlso, see this article from Apple's Knowledge base about how to remove adware.\n", "Q: How do I change how an Airport Express extends a network? My original setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Coax from Cable company into house\n\n*Cable split in two, one for TVs, other for Internet/phone modem\n\n*Ethernet cable from modem to Time Capsule (latest one w/ 802.11ac)\n\n*Used to use wireless connections to everything.\n\n*But I heard that wired is faster, and I have several fixed devices (latest AppleTV, the TV set, and a PS3) in the living room. So I got an Ethernet switch for the room and ran a cable across the house to connect to the Time Capsule.\n\n*In the basement, I have a eMac and some printers. I connected them to an Airport Express (the latest one that looks like a white AppleTV). The Express connects to the Time Capsule via WiFi.\n\n\nI heard extending a WiFi with another but using wireless communication for the connection between the primary and secondary device slows everything down. So I thought to buy another long Ethernet cable and connect the Express to the switch.\nAt first I just connect the Express to the switch without powering off anything. My MacBook Air didn't like the connection. The Airport Connection Utility on the Air still had the dashed line indicating a wireless connection. I unplugged the Express, then the Time Capsule, and replugged them in reverse order. Now the utility shows a solid line (wired connection), but trying to actually use the new WiFi connection is super slow. I unplugged the Express for now.\nIs there some sort of setting I need to re-do to get the Express to extend the Time Capsule's network, but using the wired connection between them? Should I do some sort of reset on the Express (or both)?\n\nA: I just did a factory-default reset on the AirPort Express. Then my MacBook Air saw the Express as a virgin unit, opened the AirPort Utility, and let me use automatic setup to extend the Time Capsule's WiFi network, this time via Ethernet.\n", "Q: Disable message autoselect in OS X Mail Is there a way to stop Mail from automatically selecting messages? For example when I delete a message, it will immediately select the next one and mark it read. Then if I don't want to read the message yet, I need to mark it as unread.\n\nA: Press option+delete or option+← to delete an email and not select the next email.\nIf you use an international keyboard: United states option key may be labelled alt and/or ⌥.\n\nA: I'm afraid you can not change this behaviour in the Mail.app settings.\n\nEdit: As @myhd pointed out, you can indeed change the behaviour with ⌥ + ⌫ Delete!\n\nA: I, too, prefer that Mail.app not mark the next message as read. I am also using Yosemite. The only way that I know of to accomplish this is to hide the message viewer:\nMail => Preferences => Viewing tab => select 'Use classic layout'\nNow the Mail window only shows the list of Mailboxes on the left (which is optional) and the messages in the current mailbox on the right. (You may need to drag the divider between the message list pane and the message viewer pane all the way down to the bottom of the window.) To view a message, double-click it in the list view and it opens in a separate window. From there, you can close, reply, forward, mark or delete it. If you delete it, the next message in the list is highlighted, but not marked as read until you open it.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Save data from broken Macbook Pro HDD I have a broken Macbook Pro HDD with two partitions on it: OS X and Bootcamp. I need to take some files from both partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*the HDD is now mounted to another PC via. SATA adapter\n\n*Windows sees the HDD but i can't access it. For example, I can't format it\n\n*With gparted, it says that there's no filesystem, nor allocated space\n\n*I tried CloneZilla, but since there's no filesystem, it can't copy anything\n\n*I tried testdisk and photorec without luck \n\n*I tried fdisk and superbloack options with Linux without luck\n\n\nNow, I don't know if I have to format it and try to recover the files I need, is there a way to repair?\n\nA: *\n\n*you can try to connect you HDD to another mac.\n\n*you can create full copy of this disk via dd vith noerror parameter\n\n*If you use windows you cat use Ext2Read for access to linux partition.\n\n", "Q: OSX default file permissions when copying/saving files Every time I save a file from a web browser or copy files from our local server to my machine, the default permission \"for everyone\" is set to none.\nI'm a web developer. Files that are non-readable will not be displayed when accessed from an Apache server.\nThat means I always have to go through every file manually and change their permissions.\nIs there a way to tell OSX that all files should be readable?\n\nA: From the terminal you can use the chmod command to change permissions. In this case the command would be chmod a+r *. This would change all files in a folder. If you want to do this from the Finder, you would have to create a service. You could then select a group of files and change all of them at once. The instructions are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Automator application.\n\n*Select \"Service\" and click \"Choose\".\n\n*Drag the action \"Run AppleScript\" to where it says \"Drag actions or\nfiles here to build your workflow\".\n\n*Set \"Service receives selected text in any application\" to\n\"Service receives selected files or folders in Finder\".\n\n*Replace the code\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    (* Your script goes here *)\n\n    return input\nend run\n\nwith\non run {input, parameters}\n    try\n        repeat with currentfile in input\n            try\n                do shell script \"chmod a+r \" & quoted form of POSIX path of currentfile\n            end try\n        end repeat\n    end try\n    return input\nend run\n\n\n*Save service as \"Readable by All\".\n\n*Quit the Automator application.\n\n\nThe service should have been saved in the ~/Library/Services folder under the name Readable by All.workflow.

I want to use ssh to get into my mac from an iPhone over Wi-Fi LAN with no connection to the internet. I want to do this to get access to the command line (for playing with programming related stuff) while I'm on the couch.\nI do not need an internet connection on the Mac while I do this, so it's fine for me to reserve the Macs' Wi-Fi connection for communicating with the iPone. However, When I create a network on my Mac and connect the iPhone to the network I created, it seems to work in the Wi-Fi menu, but there is no change in the networking icon from 4g to Wi-Fi. \nWill an SSH server on the Mac still be accessible to an SSH app on an iPhone? I've had trouble with file sharing from third party apps that don't know that they have a Wi-Fi connection when it's not connected to the internet. Though this does work when I use an android device to create a hotspot.\n\nA: Yes. You can. However the Apple Mac OS X operating system has SSH installed by default but the SSH daemon is not enabled. This means you can’t login remotely or do remote copies until you enable it.\nTo enable it, go to ‘System Preferences’. Under ‘Internet & Networking’ there is a ‘Sharing’ icon. Run that. In the list that appears, check the ‘Remote Login’ option.\nThis starts the SSH daemon immediately and you can remotely login using your username. The ‘Sharing’ window shows at the bottom the name and IP address to use. You can also find this out using ‘whoami’ and ‘ifconfig’ from the Terminal application.\nAn app called iTerminal - SSH Telnet Client is available free on the App Store. It allows you to connect via SSH to your Mac iTerminal.\nAnother app called Reflection for UNIX - SSH Client will also do this for free.\nTo run the server without Internet will be fine. The DCHP server will still allow access with Bonjour and manually inputting the IP address of the Mac. \n\nA: Yes, the SSH server on the Mac will still be accessible to an SSH app on the iPhone.\nThe icon change does not really signify that the WiFi is connected or not - instead it tells you whether or not the iPhone detected internet access via WiFi. In this case it does not, and it is not necessary for it to do so, so the icon does not change. Just disregard the icon.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt dock statation power charging There are two types of dock stations on the market:\n\n\n*\n\n*Docks use external MagSafe adapter to charge MBP. \n(MagSafe should be bought additional from Apple).\n\n*Docks with only Thunderbolt connection to MBP.\nWith first one power supplying is clear.\nHow does second type can charge MBP? \nIs it possible to charge laptop through thunderbolt without MagSafe?\nP.S.

How can I change to default factory? \n\nA: Most likely a change was made to the Fn key setting. The behavior you are seeing is \"Show Desktop\", but generally requires pressing Fn-F11 to activate. (Note on my keyboard Volume Down is F11. It may differ on yours, but the steps below don't chnage.)\nTo change this behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*In the second section, click on Keyboard, then on the Keyboard tab if necessary.\n\n*Uncheck \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys.\"\n\n", "Q: Terminal appears to ignore autoproxyurl setting I can't get easy_install to install anything as it complains it gets a connection refused.:\n  Searching for BeautifulSoup\nReading https://pypi.python.org/simple/BeautifulSoup/\nDownload error on https://pypi.python.org/simple/BeautifulSoup/: [Errno 61] Connection refused -- Some packages may not be found!\nCouldn't find index page for 'BeautifulSoup' (maybe misspelled?)\nScanning index of all packages (this may take a while)\nReading https://pypi.python.org/simple/\nDownload error on https://pypi.python.org/simple/: [Errno 61] Connection refused -- Some packages may not be found!\nNo local packages or download links found for BeautifulSoup\nerror: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('BeautifulSoup')\n\nIf I query the interface I am told the proxy is setup and working (which it definitely appears to be as I can browse, etc.)\nnetworksetup -getautoproxyurl Wi-fi\nURL: http://webproxy.******.co.uk/wpad.dat\nEnabled: Yes\n\nVisiting https://pypi.python.org/simple/ manually in a browser also works.\nIt gets more confusing;\nI tried setting the proxies manually instead:\ndjsmiley2k:~$ echo $HTTP_PROXY\nwebproxy.*******.co.uk:8080\ntbowers@tims-mbp:~$ echo $HTTPS_PROXY\nwebproxy.*******.co.uk:8080\n\nStill no dice :/\n\nEdit:\nMore urls appear to be affected, unsure if this is some weird resolving error I just happened to have hit at the wrong time:\ndjsmiley2k:~/bin$ echo $HTTP_PROXY\nwebproxy.*******.co.uk:8080\ndjsmiley2k:~/bin$ echo $HTTPS_PROXY\nwebproxy.*******.co.uk:8080\n\ndjsmiley2k:~/bin$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n--2015-05-18 15:30:33--  https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\nResolving bootstrap.pypa.io (bootstrap.pypa.io)... 185.31.18.175\nConnecting to bootstrap.pypa.io (bootstrap.pypa.io)|185.31.18.175|:443... failed: Connection refused.\ndjsmiley2k:~/bin$ wget http://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n--2015-05-18 15:31:49--  http://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\nResolving bootstrap.pypa.io (bootstrap.pypa.io)... 185.31.18.175\nConnecting to bootstrap.pypa.io (bootstrap.pypa.io)|185.31.18.175|:80... failed: Connection refused.\n\nI've checked and I can access the script directly in a browser, trying to go to http forwards me to https automatically.\n\nA: User error strikes again!\nI wasn't using the easy_install flags correctly, needs to be:\neasy_install --user <package>\n\nand not  --user.\n", "Q: Same dedicated Windows drive for Boot Camp and VirtualBox?

In other words, can I dedicate one hard drive, or one partition, to Windows 7, and then either\n\n\n*\n\n*choose to boot from that drive (or partition) at startup, or\n\n*boot into OS X, run VirtualBox, and have Windows inside the virtual machine boot from the same Boot Camp drive (or partition)?\n\n\nMy goal is not only to save disk space (by installing Windows and the software I need to run under it in just one place, rather than on one real drive and one virtual drive) but also to avoid having to buy multiple Windows licenses.\n\nA: The answer is No. Sorry. I have done this already. Here is the problem. VirtualBox and your Apple use different hardware. If you try to switch between the hardware you are going to drive windows insane.\nIf you first install Windows using VirtualBox's virtual hardware and a physical disk partition, then switch to Apple's physical hardware with the same physical disk partition then you have to run Microsoft's \"System Preparation Tool\". This tool is meant to be run once, not repeatedly. See\nthe procedure at this link\nThe other problem would be now are you going to activate the software for both machines. Are you going to active while running under VirtualBox or BootCamp?\nWhen you boot between the physical Apple hardware and the virtual VirtualBox hardware, the Windows operating system is going to detect the change. For example, the two machines do not share the same MBR. Each MBR will have a different signature. Windows stores this signature in its boot partition and compares the value with the MBR when booting.\n\nA: While VirtualBox is capable of Raw Disk Access it is not designed to use the Windows Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine.  In other words it does not handle the Windows Product Activation between running it physically and virtually.  VMware Fusion, a paid product, is capable of seamlessly handing using the Windows Boot Camp partition as a virtual machine.\n", "Q: Can I customize the OSX screen saver to show the Day of the Week? I would like to have a screen saver display (hopefully) a large text of today's day ... the message option on the screen saver seems to only allow fixed text with no meta tag support. \n\nA: This can't be done with any of Apple's screen savers that ship with OS X. \nMy favorite screen saver is the Marine Aquarium ($20) screen saver which has a customizable crystal that can display the time (analog or digital), date, or a calendar.\nIf you Google \"os x screen saver with date\" you'll come up with many free or inexpensive alternatives. My favorite among these is the Pong Saver, but that doesn't provide the date.\n", "Q: IPad and IPhone - backing up \"corrupted\" file - spyware on IPad My IPad Backup failed because the back up is corrupt.\nDeleting the back up using iTunes or Windows File Explorer and repeating did not work. During Backup to my PC I got multiple popups from ESET NOD32 stating I had \"adware\" spyware on my IPad. NOD32 erased them on my PC but not IPad. Repeating the back up failed again.\nI temporarily disabled NOD32 and the back up worked. But my IPad still has spyware on it. \nSearching for spyware removal software or applications .. uncovered nothing. \nHow do I remove spyware, adware, malware from my IPad??\n\nA: It's kind of Catch 22, but with a get-out clause... \nIf you let the Windows antivirus delete the suspect file, it will corrupt the backup.\nHowever, as it is being recognised as a Windows virus by a Windows antivirus, then it almost certainly cannot actually have any effect on the iPad.  \nThe iPad, of course, does not run Windows & cannot be infected by a Windows virus - even if it can 'carry' one & unfortunately, possibly pass it on. \nOne 'fix' would be to ensure your iTunes backups are encrypted [an option available in the Summary page in iTunes when your iPad is connected]  - that way the Windows antivirus can't even see the 'infection', nor, as the file would be encrypted & unreadable by Windows itself, could it infect your PC.\nThe other - more long-term - fix would be to delete the offending files from your iPad; your next backup would then be clean.\n", "Q: Cannot detect bootable USB I have a problem with installing windows:\nUSB Details:\nBefore I created a (what I classify as) bootable disk properly, I have went through the USB being corrupted because of me killing the dd process when running: sudo dd if=/path/to/windows.iso of=/dev/rdisk1. I forgot the bs=1m, so I killed the process. I used Internet Recovery to reset my disk because normal Recovery HD showed the error \"Could not open device\". The USB is a 16GB Kingston DataTraveler 100 G3.\n\nInternet recovery deleted my Recovery HD partition and rEFInd.\nAfter resetting the USB with Internet recovery, I ran the dd command again. It did not detect as a Bootable USB in Opt ⌥ menu, nor in rEFInd. I tried to boot \"Legacy OS\" which led me to a black screen saying \"No bootable device found - Insert device and press any key\". So I re-plugged my USB and tried pressing a key, without any success. How do I properly (and preferably manually) create a bootable USB that boots Windows on mac, or how do I make the USB I made detectable?\n\nI am running Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9.5)\n\nA: The solution was to plug it into a different USB port. That made it detectable and I could proceed. I set it up with Boot Camp (including the partition), and it reset into the windows setup\n", "Q: MacBook Pro keeps returning to login screen I can login to safe boot without issue. I created a new admin account through safe boot, but upon first full login into this new account, the same behaviour as in the title showed up instantly.\nI have tried Apple diagnostics boot which revealed no hardware issues. I have also tried deleting contents of /Library/Preferences and ~/Library/Preferences (for new account) but this does not seem to resolve the issue.\n\nMacbook pro 15\" (discrete graphics) late 2013 on OS X 10.10.3\n\nA: I found this problem after not using my MacBook for a while. \nI removed the battery. Pressed the on button for 30 seconds with the battery removed and power chord unplugged. \nPut the battery back in. Restart, and mine was o.k \n", "Q: Remove duplicate photos in photos app in Yosemite I've accidentally clicked Duplicate Items in context menu after selecting 100+ photos in Photos app in Yosemite. Is there an automatic way to remove the duplicates now? An app that integrates with Photos app and removes duplicates would be fine as well.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Few ways to do that.\nI would use the DIY way to make sure it is not deleting unwanted stuff.\nSort by name and decide what to delete.\nUse apps like: Duplicate Cleaner For iPhoto\nCreate Automator workflow (it is not worth the time creating and testing it).\nUse Terminal (although not recommend due to possibility of deleting wrong stuff).\nJust an example:\nOpen Terminal from Spotlight or the Utilities folder.\nChange to the directory (folder) you want to search from (including sub-folders) using the cd command. At the command prompt type cd  for example cd ~/Documents to change directory to your home Documents folder.\nAt the command prompt, type the following command: \nfind . -size 20 \\! -type d -exec cksum {} \\; | sort | tee /tmp/f.tmp \\ | cut -f 1,2 -d ' ' | uniq -d | grep -hif /tmp/f.tmp > duplicates.txt\n\nThis method uses a simple checksum to determine whether files are identical. The names of duplicate items will be listed in a file named duplicates.txt in the current directory. Open this to view the names of identical files.\n", "Q: Time Machine fails to create an incremental backup I use Time Machine to create incremental backups to an external USB hard drive. Backups used to complete properly, but now Time Machine wants to backup much more data. Instead of the couple of GB of new data, the Time Machine menu bar icon popup menu reports it is going to backup 400+ GB! I stopped the backup as soon as I saw this to avoid filling up my backup drive. This is the relevant part of the backupd log:\n18/05/15 21:05:06,778 com.apple.backupd[11380]: Starting manual backup\n18/05/15 21:05:07,004 com.apple.backupd[11380]: Backing up to /dev/disk1s2: /Volumes/MacBackup/Backups.backupdb\n18/05/15 21:05:15,385 com.apple.backupd[11380]: Will copy (22.3 MB) from Macintosh HD\n18/05/15 21:06:04,176 com.apple.backupd[11380]: Will copy (Zero KB) from Data\n18/05/15 21:06:04,225 com.apple.backupd[11380]: Found 761313 files (380.84 GB) needing backup\n18/05/15 21:06:05,392 com.apple.backupd[11380]: 406.52 GB required (including padding), 904.71 GB available\n18/05/15 21:06:48,246 com.apple.backupd[11380]: Copied 550 items (22.2 MB) from volume Macintosh HD.

Linked 165.\n18/05/15 21:07:38,738 com.apple.backupd[11380]: Backup canceled.\n\nFor some reason, backupd reports it will copy \"(Zero KB)\" from the Data partition (on an external eSATA hard drive). The output from tmutil compare shows that less than 4 GB needs to be backed up:\nAdded:         3.6G\nRemoved:       26.3K\nChanged:       292.2M\n\nWhen ejecting the Data disk, Time Machine does backup the internal hard disk as it should (some tens of MB).\nI have a feeling this could be related to the fact that the Data drive was not properly ejected one or more times. Disk Utility's \"Verify Disk\" reports no problems with the disk however. Also the backup disk is clean.\nI think I ran into this problem once before, but then I didn't abort the backup. The backup drive filled up quickly to the point where no new backups could be made. The solution then was to erase my backup HD and configure it as a new backup disk (losing all existing backups).\nHow can I fix Time Machine to perform as before without having to erase the backup disk and start from scratch? I don't want to be forced to do this every couple of months.\nUPDATE I haven't seen this behavior in a long time now. Perhaps it was a bug fixed in a macOS upgrade...\n\nA: EDIT I noticed this seems to happen randomly. Sometimes, Time Machine will start to back up the 400+ GB. At other times, it performs a normal incremental backup. So, I am not sure the procedure listed below really has any effect. I'll leave the description there just in case...\nWhen the external USB HD is connected, I now simply check Time Machine when it starts to backup. If it wants to backup the 400+GB, I simply \"Skip\" the backup. If not, I let it continue. Not a perfect solution by far, but it works for me.\n\nI booted my Mac in safe mode to see if this would solve the problem. Alas, it did not. Afterwards, whether caused by the safe boot or not, Time Machine didn't \"see\" the external Data partition anymore, so it would only backup from the internal SSD (and the TM preferences windows no longer listed the WinData partition in the list of excluded items).\nAt that point I reset Time Machine's configuration, as described in James Pond's Full Reset of Time Machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*switch off Time Machine in the preferences window\n\n*make sure no backup is running\n\n*connect external drives included in the backup\n\n*take a screenshot of the TM preferences (the exclusion list)\n\n*disconnect the backup disk\n\n*delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\n\n*reboot your Mac\n\n*connect your backup disk\n\n*re-configure Time Machine\n\n\n*\n\n*select your backup disk\n\n*copy the TM preferences from the screenshot\n\n\n\nAfter this process, Time Machine sees my external Data disk again; Data and WinData are automatically included in the excluded items list. After removing Data from the list, Time Machine now properly creates incremental backups of Data again.\nThere was one small problem however. The new files added to Data recently (right before TM started to make huge backups) were not backed up. To solve this, the following worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*move these new files to another disk\n\n*create a new backup (size near 0)\n\n*place the files pack\n\n*create a new backup\n\n\nYou can perhaps use tmutil compare to see which files were not backed up.\n", "Q: Early 2013 MacBook Pro UE Boom Bluetooth Issues I've tried lots of different solutions to get these two working nicely together.\nSo far I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-Pairing the devices\n\n*Removing and recreating all the Bluetooth plist files\n\n*Executing (defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent \"Apple Bitpool Min (editable)\" 53)\nNothing seems to fix the drop outs in the audio.  I was experiencing it while watching Netflix but I've just tried iTunes and that does the same thing.\nWorks fine when paired with my iPad Mini.\nI bought the speaker shortly after getting the MacBook and it originally worked flawlessly, then an Update to OSX took out BT and WiFi, and got that fixed by deleted the plist files.\nAfter the update to Yosemite nothing seems to fix it.  It makes listening or watching anything but a pleasure and is actually now very annoying.\nWhat should my next attempt be at fixing this?\n\nA: I've had some success by installing XCode, then installing the associated hardware IO tools, which include the bluetooth explorer.  The bluetooth explorer makes available tools..audio options, which lets you tune some settings.\nThe settings I found useful were to increase the bitpool (which appears directly related to audio quality), and to increase the buffer packets, which appears to make it more tolerant of temporary dropouts.  YMMV.\n\nA: I've just gone through this process for a second time but the last action I performed was a complete reset of the SMC.\nAfter then re-pairing the MacBook to the UE Boom it seems the drop out issues have in fact gone completly.\nHow to reset your SMC\n", "Q: Is it possible to browse my iTunes backup files? I use to store older backups of my iPad, iPod and iPhone made using iTunes.  \nSo, as long as some data (i.e: photos) is stored on one of these backups, I feel free to delete it on the devices.  \nIf, in a future, I need only some specific data (say music, document, video, email... etc), may I access to the backup to...? :\n\n\n*\n\n*Browse it to see what is there inside.\n\n*Extract some specific info.\n\n\nIf yes, what kind of data could be extracted? :  \n\n\n*\n\n*Only files like photos, videos or documents?\n\n*Or is it possible to dig for some more complex data like SMSs, notes, emails, phone lists... etc?\n\n\nRemember that I don't want to restore any backup. I just want to look inside it.  Also, I don't want recommendations on software that reads the files. I'm looking for how to understand what's on the filesystem.\n\nA: Yes! It is possible to view the contents of backups. There are several programs you can use, the one I use is iExplorer v3.\nYou can view and extract:\n\n\n*\n\n*Messages\n\n*Contacts\n\n*Voicemail (though I have not tried this)\n\n*Call history\n\n*Notes\n\n*Safari (bookmarks and history)\n\n*Calendar\n\n*More if you are willing to dig into folders\n\n\nThe free version allows you to view the contents, but has restrictions on extracting them.\nThere is also iPhone Backup Extractor which does:\n\n\n*\n\n*Photos\n\n*Recordings\n\n*Again, perhaps more\n\n\nThis is also a free / paid app, so have a look at what you need.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Even when suggestions from @OrangePeel are good, if you don't want to pay to browse WhatsApp conversations, this is your best bet: FonePaw's iPhone Data Recovery.  \nThe trial version (15 days) seems to have full features, not like iPhone Backup Extractor, that only extracts 4 lines from WhatsApp.\nThe rest of options are very complete too:\n\n", "Q: Does the newest Macbook and/or Macbook air have 3.5mm linein? I need to record external sounds. \nI am not convinced that the newest Macbook's external cable can guarantee the best recording quality. Since the newest Macbook and/or Macbook air do not have 3.5mm line-in?\nIf is it possible to know how much data the connection loses.\n\nA: \nYes, so there will be loss of data when doing the USB and Apple conversion. So best one is to use analog.\n\nYou seem confused over the process here.\nThe analog-to-digital conversion is the important step, and it should be done as soon after the source as possible. The audio in/out port on any laptop is designed for speech over video calls, not music, and will have a very basic analog-to-digital converter.\nIf you want high-quality recordings, go to any pro audio supplier and buy a converter. You will have many options in a wide price range, all the way up to recording studio quality.\nOnce the audio signal is converted to digital there will be zero loss of quality while it moves over USB into the computer. That's the whole point of digital audio.\n\nA: You can record external audio with a breakout cable like this. But for best results, you should use  a USB interface. I have this and it works great (and can be battery or USB powered).\n\nA: Here is my 2 cents worth on that topic.\nAnalog input (3.5mm jack) would go directly to the audio processor on your system and depending on the quality of the processor you will get some level of audio, but not the same as the audio line it self.\nIf you use Audio to USB now you might have additional signal loss due to USB been the converter to serial data before it arrives at audio processor.\nSo with USB it is all depending on the speed of it, how fast can it transfer audio signal without loss.\nI would say the new USB3 is very fast and one would almost not notice the loss in audio, certainty not detectable by human ear but with some equipment.\nThe Audio signal is one continuous amplitude and frequency form.\nThe digital would take that and to its best ability dived it in to 1 and zeros in the effort to mimic the analog one.\n", "Q: How can I identify what my problem is from a Panic Report?

You may need the DVD that came with the computer to do this. Run the fast, non-extended test, and if there are any GPU problems that it can detect, it will tell you so. Otherwise, while there still may be hardware problems, the last thing to do before giving up is to do a quick reinstall of the OS. You won't lose your data, but it will refresh all of the system files, and may fix the issue if the problem is a corrupted driver.\n\nA: The answer to your question depends on some data you didn't provide, so here is your \"choose your own adventure\" for Kernel Panics on OS X.\nIf this is a one time event, forget about it: How serious are occasional kernel panics?\nIf this is repeatable, you can actually dig into the items from multiple dumps that are common to them all. If you can't do this analysis, ask us to explain with some details.\nIf this is not repeatable but not occasional, you'll have to troubleshoot a bit to narrow down the cause:\nHow can I troubleshoot Kernel Panics on my iMac\nIf all else fails, you can pay Apple (or a knowledgable person) to analyze your specific dump. Service and consultants are at https://locate.apple.com\n\nA: Here is what I read:\nYou have inserted a USB device with some .msdofs file system. \nThat lead to GPU panic.\nNothing wrong with the GPU, it just could not handle the .msdosfs.\nWhile at it please Disable the Sophos virus scanner just in case it was responsible for that.\nRun the non invasive system report app called EtreCheck to get additional information on your system.\nCheck the content of that USB.\n", "Q: Create a new partition after Bootcamp I've installed Windows with the Boot Camp Assistant Tool but I want to create a third parition to install Ubuntu. On the Mac I can't change the volume size, is not that i receive some error, is just don't give me the ability to shrink it. If i try to resize the Windows partition from Windows (so to get some free space from there), Windows says that the maximum aviable space that can be reduced is 600 MB (even if I have 30 GB free on Bootcamp partition). Is there a way to create another partition without deleting Bootcamp?\n\nA: Winclone is the OS X software to backup and restore the Windows OS on a BootCamp partition.  http://twocanoes.com/winclone/\nIt lets you escape Apple's restriction to only have two OS partitions on a drive. You still might have to delete bootcamp, but you can then restore it in working form after you've re-done the boot drive partitioning to your liking.\nAlso see this question for core storage complications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can't reduce size of OSX partition in bootcamp\n\nA: You'll need a third party utility that can repartition a live drive.  The Apple software will not make additional partitions beyond the Bootcamp one.  Or, the hard-but-effective way is to back everything up, wipe and repartition, then copy back.  Winclone is a good program for backing up Boot Camp partitions.\nPersonally, this issue was worth it to me to buy Parallels and run Ubuntu (and eventually Windows) on a virtual drive.  That way it's just files on my single Mac partition.\n", "Q: My pictures are gone from my photo stream on my ipad My photos from Photo Stream on my iPad were here one minute, and gone next. I charged it, but it didn't show up still.\n\nA: I checked Apple support and find that the photos you upload to My Photo Stream are stored in iCloud for 30 days to give your devices plenty of time to connect and download them. If you pass the time, your photo may be deleted.\n\nA: Photostream only stores photos for 30 days. Could you have left them beyond that limit?\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202299\n", "Q: Pillars of Eternity: Better to buy from Mac App Store or from Steam? I haven't played a video game on my computer in over a decade and I'm unfamiliar with modern technologies. If I want to buy Pillars of Eternity, am I better off getting it through the mac app store or through Steam?\n\nA: Steam. With steam, you'll be able to play it on Windows too, should you ever have the need. The same can't be said for the MAS, which only offers the Mac version. It's a nice bit of future-proofing, incase you ever get a Windows PC in the future. To put it simply, you get more for your money.\n\nA: Go with Steam.\n\n\n*\n\n*Play on Windows if you want to.\n\n*Faster update.\n\n", "Q: Why does my iPad send me immediately to the App Store instead of Safari? I tapped on Safari and suddenly it sent me to the App Store. I tried going back to Safari but it just kept going to the App Store. It just wants me to buy random apps that I don't want.\n\nA: Safari was likely last opened to a page that had an iTunes link in it, forwarding you to the App store (similar to ads that people accidentally click on in Games). Try fully closing out the Safari session by double-clicking on the Home button on your iPad, then swipe Safari up from the Multitasker. Then, make sure the session won't reload by going to Settings -> Safari -> Clear website data and history. It will blow your Safari history away but should clear whatever site it has open as well. Note, bookmarks won't be affected by that process :) \nOr try to follow a link from Mail, Twitter etc (whatever opens in Safari), then open the \"all tabs\" view in Safari and close the 'tab' with the auto-forwarding.\n", "Q: How can I delete offensive emojis on my iPhone keyboard I would like to be able to delete certain emojis on my keyboard. How do I do that?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no way to edit the Apple Emoji keyboard.  You can, however, turn it off, by following the instructions posted at the following question:\nHow can I remove Emoji keyboard from iOS8?\n\nSettings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards. You'll see English and Emoji.\nOn the top right corner is the word Edit. Press Edit, and then tap the red button followed by Delete to remove the Emoji keyboard.\n\nAdditionally, you may be able to find a 3rd-party Emoji keyboard on the app store that is customizable.\n\nA: Custom Keyboard\nIf you are using an iOS device, such as an iPhone, you may be able to customise the available emojis using a custom keyboard.\niMore review a few custom keyboards and others are likely discoverable with the search custom iOS keyboard.\nTell Apple\nGiven you find some emojis offensive, I recommend letting Apple know via Apple's feedback page. This may be useful cultural information that their designers are not familiar with.\n", "Q: Still shows 1GB of photos in usage after deleting all I deleted every single photo from my iPhone (after backing up on computer), including both camera roll and photostream (I disabled photostream afterwards). For some reason it's still showing 1GB of \"camera roll\" in settings -> general -> usage -> photos. When I connect it to iTunes, it shows something weird like \"189mb\" of photos. Anyone know what's causing this and how to fix it? Even if there are still photos in some apps shouldn't these be in the \"documents and data\" category not photos?\n\nA: Assuming you have IOS 8.x...\nGo to Photos -> Albums -> recently deleted.\nTap on Select (upper right) then \"Delete All\" lower left. That should do it. My experience is that the space used will take a while to update to reflect the removed images.\n", "Q: How to Set my Mac's $PATH back the way it was before I am just getting started with Terminal, the other day I might have messed something up with my urs/local/bin. When executing echo $PATH it returns me with /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin the original path was /usr/local/bin.\nHow do I set it back to factory settings?\n\nA: By default the paths are saved in the file /etc/paths. You can edit it e.g. with sudo vim /etc/paths. Each line should contain one directory used for $PATH.\nThen there is the directory /etc/paths.d/ that can contain text files with paths in it.\nFurthermore the path can be modified in the files ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile.\n\nHowever, the $PATH you are stating is the default one and usually desired. Restricting it to only /usr/local/bin would make a lot of default applications - like vim, ls, or even sudo that reside in /usr/bin/ or /bin/ - inaccessible without typing their whole paths every time. \n", "Q: Safari Downloader+ and Streaming Media Using Safari Downloader+ on iOS 8.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I prompt download for streamable media?\n\n\nDirect links to files work without any problems whatsoever, but streamable media doesn't prompt anything more than streaming (in what seems to be Apples QuickTime player).\n\nA: Stream media have the download disabled. \nYou would need a special Safari add on to record/download them.\nFor more resources see following:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/69883/46541\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/72914/46541\n", "Q: Clear terminal and prevent restoration There is some sensitive data (credit card numbers and such) that I store on my hard drive, encrypted. I use a script to decrypt the data and display it in the terminal window. When I am finished, I would like the script to clear the terminal, so that the sensitive data can no longer be viewed (even if someone gains access to my computer).\nI have read here that ⌘+k clears the terminal output. To implement this in a script, I used AppleScript as suggested in the accepted answer to this question:\n/usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Terminal\" to keystroke \"k\" using command down'\n\nFinally, my script closes the terminal window with\nkillall Terminal\n\nThe problem: if I leave the terminal window with the sensitive output open for about 30 seconds or longer before closing if, then the next time I open terminal, it restores the sensitive data (the text [restored] is displayed below it). If the data was initially displayed for less time, it is not restored.\n\nHow can I clear the terminal window from within a script, and prevent Terminal from restoring the cleared data?\n\nI am running OS X 10.10.3.\n\nA: Final Solution:\nRemove the Terminal saved state, located in:\n~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState/*\n\nThen, make that folder read-only so that it can't be written to.\n\nYou can use the clear command to clear your terminal window from within a script.  As noted on this other thread, the following commands in sequence will clear the current buffer, then the scroll back buffer:\nclear && printf '\\e[3J'\n\n\nPlease note:\n  (The clear command looks up the appropriate sequence for clearing the screen for the current terminal, but the “erase scroll-back” escape sequence is custom and must be hard-coded. If you put this in a shell script that you don’t know for certain will only ever be run with Terminal, you should check that $TERM_APPLICATION is Apple_Terminal before sending it.)\n\n\nAlternative 1\nTurn off Terminal.app's window restore functionality:\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false\n\n\nAlternative 2\nYou can also store sensitive information in the Secure Notes section within the Keychain Access utility.\n \n\nA: After reading the other answers and looking into this myself I have observed some file system behavior, which implies a very simple solution. The terminal program stores it's data in \n~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState/\n\nas noted above. When I quit the entire Terminal app (cleanly) this entire folder is deleted. The reason the OP is getting restored data is because he is crashing the terminal app with killall. I observed this by opening finder to the Saved Application State folder and starting and quitting terminal. The down side of this is that you have to close ALL terminal windows, but in this way all saved state appears to be wiped clean (baring disk forensics of course) \nThere appears to be one file in this directory for every open terminal window (but not every tab!) plus data.data and windows.plist and window_1.data that presumably represents the terminal program itself. The per-terminal files disappear on the closing of the window however the data.data file is the one that grows as commands are issued and thus presumably stores the scrollback buffer. It does not shrink on the closing of the terminal window implying that it continues to hold scrollback data. The data.data file does however shrink when the next terminal window is opened. It also shrinks drastically when another terminal window is updated (by pressing return for example). Thus it appears that the following routine will (probably) wipe the scrollback data completely:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cleanly close the window with the sensitive data (e.g. red dot, command + w)\n\n*Open a new terminal window OR cause scroll in another terminal window that is already open.\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the entire terminal application cleanly (Command + q etc)\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that the data.data file is not a text file. It is a binary file that will require effort to interpret. My guess is that the data is compressed in some way. A simple cat of the file reveals nothing legible. So for these files to be a vulnerability, it seems both of the following must be true:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal has died and NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows is true (see other answer), or the terminal window was closed and no other window has been opened or updated.\n\n*The attacker is sophisticated enough to know enough to look for and know how to decode the data.data file. \n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: the above is based entirely on observation of how files appear/disappear and how their sizes change. It is of course still possible that some partial information is retained if the maintenance of the data.data file is sloppy. However these observations seem good enough for me. Decide for yourself if it's good enough for you.\nThese observations come from OS X 10.9.5 and Terminal Version 2.4 (326), please verify the above described behavior if you are using some other version before relying on this advice. Any or all of this could change with new versions of terminal or Mac OSX.\n\nA: try history -c\nand command + k\nsorry \njust send the output to /dev/null\nIf you need to view or store the output, then redirect it to a file for later use your_commands > path_to_filename/filename_where_output_is_stored \n", "Q: Orientation won't unlock I have an iPad Air 2. I was having problems with volume until I loaded the 8.1 OS. Now I have volume but my orientation is locked.

I need to have iOS simulator for my Linux Mint OS to check my website responsive in various iOS devices is this possible as I know this feature is available in almost all Macs but I cannot afford a Mac right now.\n\nA: The iOS simulator is a large chunk of iOS compiled for OS X (minus the app store, among other things). You won't be able to port it without the source code, which Apple isn't going to share. iOS development can be done on other platforms, but you're not going to get the simulator.\n\nA: I ended up my need by using Online simulators which perfectly resembles the actual devices output.\nHere are the links for online simulators...\n\nhttp://transmog.net/\nhttps://www.browserstack.com/list-of-browsers-and-platforms?product=live#ios\n\n", "Q: Can I use GNU ps on OS X? We can install GNU coreutils via brew. But there's no ps in the utils. Can we use gnu ps in OS X?\nI'd like to use GNU ps as it has more options and features.\n\nA: ps is not part of GNU coreutils according to Wikpedia.  The version that comes with my Linux distribution seems to be from procps, but it seems like there is no formula for it in homebrew.  There are formulas for pstree which can give you great tree views, and also htop is another good process viewer.\n\nA: There is no portable ps program. The ps command available on linux is, as others have mentioned, from the \"procps\" package. The reason why this cannot be ported to OSX is because Linux and OSX kernels do not expose this information in the same way. Linux uses a pseudo-filesystem in /proc, whereas OSX uses the sysctl function. Other systems may use either mechanism but provide data in a different format, or may require programs like ps to read directly from the kernel's memory.\nIn general there is no standard for how process information is available to programs like ps and top; so the program has to be designed for a specific operating system. If there is a specific feature missing from the OSX ps, you'll have to find another program that can do it, or write one yourself (look at the sysctl manual, in particular KERN_PROC as a starting point), or modify the existing ps command to add the feature.\nAlternately, if you can get what you need by parsing the output of the ps command itself, you may be able to write a portable program - the output with the -o option is reasonably reliable across platforms, particularly if you refer to the UNIX standard for the column names to use.\n\nA: No - since it does not exist. As to why there is no builtin ps in GNU’s coreutils package, see this answer on the Unix & Linux Forums.\nThe best alternative formula available via Homebrew is psgrep:\n\npsgrep  is a small Bash shell script that searches the process list\n  (as obtained by ps(1) ) using the awesome utility grep(1)  for  its  power.\n\nThat said, you can still use psgrep to behave as OS X’s ps would. For example:\n   OPTIONS\n   -a     Search the process list using BSD's \"ps aux\" format. This option\n          includes all users' processes in the search.\n\n   -b     Search the process list using BSD's \"ps  ux\"  format  (default).\n          This option only includes the running user's processes.\n\n\npgrep is also available via brew, which is syntactically closer to ps, but less efficient than psgrep:\n\npsgrep(1) is  more  useful  than pgrep(1) because not only can it search the process list and return a PID, it can give more useful information such as  its  UID,  GID,  memory/CPU usage, niceness, and anything else supported by ps. \n\n\nAll emphasis mine. \n", "Q: Terminal backslash input repeated in output I'm using zsh on a MacBook Pro, OS X 10.10. When I type in certain commands, such as this one:\ncat myfile | awk -F $'\\t' '{print $8, $9}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1,1n | awk '{if ($1 > 50) sum += $1} END {print sum}'\n\n, then part of the command is repeated before the actual output of the command. The output in this case looks like:\n    \" '{print $8, $9}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1,1n | awk '{if ($1 > 50) sum += $1} END {print sum}' : myusername2525\n\nDoes anybody know how to get of the jumbled output? It kind of looks like a format string vulnerability or something similar to me.\n\nA: The problem is the $ in the first awk statement in the chain:\nawk -F $'\\t' '{print $8, $9}'\n\nThe -F option for awk sets the record separator for your input. If you're really expecting the separator to be a dollar sign followed by a tab character you should move the dollar sign in to the single quotes like so:\nawk -F '$\\t' '{print $8, $9}'\n\nLeaving the $ outside the single quotes means it's being interpreted by the shell as a variable reference. This is what's leading to your weird output. If you aren't expecting a dollar sign in the field separator, only a tab, change the awk call to:\nawk -F '\\t' '{print $8, $9}'\n\nBased on what you've said, the above appears to be what you want.\n", "Q: New Apple Photos app and iCloud: uploading archived libraries As my macbook doesn't have enough storage for my family photos and videos, every 1-2 years I'd start a new iPhoto library, and will place the old one on an external USB disk. I have 4-5 iPhoto libraries on an external disk now, altogether it's around 180gb.\nIs there any way to upload everything into the new icloud storage? I want to be able to access photos repo from any idevice I have.\n\nA: Merge them into one library (iPhoto Library Manager will do this job), then upload them to iCloud by designating the combined library as System Photo Library in Photos' preferences, after opening and converting it with Photos.\nAnother way to merge two or more libraries is described on the Apple site:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204414\n\nIf you designate a new library as the System Photo Library and then\n  turn on iCloud Photo Library, the photos and videos in the new library\n  will merge with those already in your iCloud Photo Library.

When I plugged in an external microphone, it would't work either.\nDoes anyone have any ideas what could it be?\n\nA: I use a MacBook Pro, but I've noticed this behaviour with some software, where the audio gain in System Preferences gets reduced to zero (i.e., no mic input). I suggest the following procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the software that you're having difficuty with.\n\n*Go System Preferences >> Sound >> Input\n\n*Increase the Input volume slider as desired\n\n*Switch back to your software application, without closing the System Preferences dialog.\n\n\nFor some reason, if you close System Preferences, then this can cause the software to reassert zero gain.\nYou might also want to consider resetting the system, just to ensure that you're resetting anything that might be inadvertently causing your issue.\n", "Q: Would the battery from a 13\" MacBook Pro (2010) work in a 15\" MacBook Pro 2011? The battery of my MacBook Pro 15\" (early 2011) died recently and I happen to have the battery from a 13\" MacBook Pro (2010) handy. \nDoes anyone know of any reasons why this battery would not work? \nI'm not concerned about battery life - I just want to be able to power the thing up. \nAny ideas?\nThanks!\n\nA: Nope. They're different sizes. Compare iFixit's guide to replacing a 15\" early 2011 battery to their guide for a 2010 13\":\n15\": \n\n13\":\n\nBoth batteries are roughly proportional to their cases, and the 15\" has a substantially bigger case than the 13\". Additionally, they're shaped differently - see the little notch in the top left of the 15\" battery, which isn't there on the 13\" battery. It physically won't fit.\n\nA: It would be useful that you mention the battery numbers that are printed upon them.\nI can confirm that the A1322 battery from a MacBook Pro 13'' loads correctly when attached to the MacBook Pro 15'' A1286 8,2 Early 2011.\nBoth batteries operate at same voltage. The one from the 13'' has smaller capacity.\nThe connector of the A1322 batttery is at a different location than thus of A1321 / A1382 batteries, so that you cannot insert the battery into the MacBook 15'', at least without replacing the 2.5'' drive by a shorter SSD modul.\nHowever, you can hold the battery with your hand. For me, this proved useful to check that a newer battery would fix a jerky mouse cursor issue.\n", "Q: Confusion in understanding data fork, resource fork and the MachO file format when viewed all together Note: I am a newbie to the OS X world. So please take it easy if I ask something noobish.\nAccording to what I have read/understood: MachO's file layout consists of a header, load commands and data segment that contains either executable instructions or data. But after reading about fork s(data & resource) I am confused.\nConfusion: In HFS files are not monolithic and doesn't consist of single segment. Apple Mac files usually exist out of two files the data fork and resource fork.They have an identical name and are shown by Mac as a single file. The resource fork contains the code of the program in execuatables.\nHow did I ponder here? I copied a file named filename from a Mac to my pendrive and opened it on Windows result 2 files ._filename and filename.\nQuestion: Where do these forks fit in the file layout? There is no mention in the file layout about the forks. Are these two forks integrated to make a final mach file? Can the ._filename (resource fork) have malicious code?\n\nA: The ._filename file does not only contain the resource fork, it also contains Finder metadata, in AppleDouble format.\nThe resource fork itself can be viewed on an HFS volume by opening filename/..namedfork/rsrc. Forks and other extended attributes can be listed by using ls -l@.\nResource forks are not specific to the Mach-O format (and I do not know if they are used at all for it), they're a feature from classic Mac OS which was extensively used for classic application files, and could store things like string tables, bitmap images, etc.\nMalicious code can be hidden anywhere, a virus scanner should be able to detect it even if it is hidden in a resource fork.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to scroll window up and down? In Windows, there's a really useful keyboard shortcut for scrolling the current text editor window up or down by one line without moving the cursor. This appears to be implemented in the operating system because it works in almost every application.\nThe shortcut is ⌃ CTRL+↑ Up Arrow to move the viewport up the document and ⌃ CTRL+↓ Down Arrow to move the viewport down the document.\nIs there something similar in OS X?\n\nA: You can try ⇞ page up and ⇟ page down, which usual pages one whole page back and forth. I don't think there is a system wide shortcut to scroll by line.\n\nA: Apple's official list of macOS keyboard shortcuts only has ⌃ CTRL+P to \"move up one line\" and ⌃ CTRL+N to \"move down one line\", but it seems to work exacly like ↑ and ↓, moving the cursor.\n", "Q: Why would adding a USB extension cord to my keyboard affect my Bluetooth connection to my magic mouse? Just wondering if some hardware guru can explain why this happens?  If I plug my full size USB keyboard into my Early 2013 MBP 13\" Retina running Yosemite 10.10 without the USB extension cord it comes with, my Bluetooth Magic Mouse has intermittent problems, and can't pair.\nBut if I add the extension cord, then it works like a charm.\nThis took a while to deduce, and I was wondering how an extension cord can make a difference?  Any thoughts?\n\n\nA: Are you plugging the keyboard into the USB 3.0 port? The signaling rate of USB 3.0 can cause RF emissions that can interfere with Bluetooth, WiFi, and other devices. Intel has a detailed paper on USB 3.0* Radio Frequency Interference on 2.4 GHz Devices\nMy suspicion is that the extension cable has better shielding than the keyboard's cable and moving the keyboard's cable just a little further from the chassis drops the RF interference enough for the pairing to work.\nTry switching it to the USB 2.0 port. Does the problem go away?\nUpdate: I struck out parts that don't apply to that model. I have the mid-2012 15\" Retina which still had the USB 3 on the left and USB 2 on the right.\n", "Q: How do I remove old employers mailbox from my i4 without losing anything else? I recently left a company. The i4 phone is mine, but my old companies mailbox is on the phone. I can no longer access these emails. I want to delete the mailbox but I am afraid I will lose all of the contacts in the process. When I delete the mailbox, what exactly will be deleted?\n\nA: If you are talking about the Exchange link: All services bound to that account will be removed. For example, if you add a new contact, the iPhone should have asked you where you want to add them. Either in the Exchange account or in the iCloud. If you've selected Exchange for this all the time, the contacts are saved in the Exchange account and will be gone once you removed the company account.\nIncluded in Exchange can be: Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Reminders and Notes.\n", "Q: What is this 'Autoupdate' app that keeps popping up in the dock? I've recently seen this app show up in the dock a couple of times. Any idea what it is? I'm slightly concerned as it doesn't look very official and I fear it could be malicious:\n\n\nA: That icon is from http://sparkle-project.org, which is an open-source auto-updating framework.  However, it could be embedded in almost any application, since Sparkle is one of the most popular auto-update frameworks in indie Mac software.\nDid you recently install new software that has Automatically check for updates checked in the preferences?\nEdit to include my comment.\nIf you're interested in locating which application it is from, you can hold ⌘ Command and click the icon in the dock (or right-click and select Options > Show In Finder), and it will open its location in the Finder.  You can then right click on the top of the Finder window that appears (on the icon), to show the path to the containing application.\n\nWith this method, you can see that this Autoupdate.app is from within iTerm.\n\nA: If you right click the Dock icon and select Options > Show in Finder, you should be able to see the path to the application it resides in.\n(If necessary enable the \"path bar\" in Finder's View menu ⌥⌘P)\nYou can also use the Activity Monitor app to find that app and in the details, it will show all the open files. With that information you should be able to suss out which program / package is updating and turn off the update check or just update it directly from the developer site.\n\nA: Autoupdate does not always show up in the Dock.  I was able to find out what application was driving the update by: opening Activity Monitor, going to the CPU tab, entering autoupdate in the search bar, double-clicking on it to get the process information pane, and reading what it said under \"Open Files and Ports\".  \n(The open files go away if you enter your password and finish the update, so you have to examine it first.)\n", "Q: See other months on Apple Watch Calendar? How can I see months other than the present one on an Apple Watch in the built-in Calendar app?\n\nA: I don't believe you can. However, as others have suggested in the comments, there are third party apps you can use that will do the job. I suggest using Sunrise Calendar. You can integrate it with your iCloud and Google calendars (and I believe some other calendars), and it has a day-by-day view on the Apple Watch that works nicely (not your typical calendar view, but it works, showing every day of that month and other months). If you want to see the days in the next month, just keep on scrolling down and tapping \"Load more\" until you are at the desired month. You can't see each entire month, but this way, you can at the very least see every single day of many months in the future, including the days on which you have no events, which is the feature I'm assuming you're looking for.\n\nUPDATE: Over time, I've found a few other apps that may help, though there are none that show you the entire year, month by month, at a glance.\nWeek Agenda:\nYou can easily view each day of multiple months with this app, but you'll have to tap on arrow keys to scroll through all of the days.\nAdd Event:\nThough to create reminders/alerts and repeating events, you'd need to buy an in app purchase, this app will let you add calendar events to the default calendar on your phone for free. This is not what you were looking for, but it may prove helpful given that your question was in regards to calendars.\nI have seen plenty of apps that replicate the functionality of the original Calendar app that comes natively with the watch, but they only show one month at a time.\nIf you're willing to deviate from apps that are meant for calendaring, another solution would be to use something like Exhibition, which allows you to view selected photos on the watch. If you have a square photo of the desired month(s) on a calendar, you could always put them on the app and view them on your watch that way.\n\nUPDATE 2: Now that Sunrise has been discontinued, another alternative you can look into is Coyomi. The little calendar app has all the functionality you were looking for when you first asked this question: it displays calendars for the upcoming months on your Apple Watch or your iPhone's Today View.\n", "Q: Has it been ever possible to implant a monitoring device or software in a Macbook that cannot be detected by antivirus? I have a several-year old pre-unibody Macbook and am wondering if my family member could have ever put some kinda tracking or monitoring device or software in it either directly or by remote access? I don't exactly know how they would do such a thing. I recently ran Norton antivirus with nothing found, but can it miss some things sometimes? For example i am concerned about it being GPS-tracked or my computer activity being monitored by unknown screen sharing or keyboard tracking ... etc etc\n\nA: Yes. It is possible, including through Mobile Device Management (MDM) applications which are generally legitimate, and through more nefarious means as well. Since it's such a broad topic, addressing the many ways that someone could do this would be too open-ended. Think of how a school is able to track a computer it has issued to a student, in terms of location, screen-watching, and the sort.\nTo guarantee, at least from the software side, that this is not happening, you'd want to perform an Erase and Install. In terms of any sort of hardware implementation, that is such an unlikely scenario that I'd count it out.\nIf you want to check for MDM, most often they will install a Profile onto your computer. This can be seen in System Preferences -> Profiles (fourth row down). It will only appear if a profile is installed.\n", "Q: How to use external monitor with MacBook Air closed and on battery power? I often use my MacBook Air (running OS X 10.9.5) closed at a docking station, where it's hooked to external monitor, keyboard/trackpad, and power. All good. The only issue is that occasionally the external power will come loose or jostle*, which turns off the external monitor or causes it to flicker. I understand the system is designed to work this way -- no external monitor when closed unless the power is plugged in. \nMy question is: how to change this default behavior? i.e. keep the external monitor going while closed on battery power?\n[*] Why you ask? My loving, atttention-seeking cats. \n\nA: You can. All you need is an app such as NoSleep.\n\n\nA: In case it helps anyone who isn't comfortable downloading an app for this. I have the exact same need when I forget to bring my AC Adapter to the office, and I've worked around it by simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mirroring the 2 displays (MacBook's & external)\n\n*Dimm the MacBook display all the way down to off (press F1 until the display turns off)\n\n\nI still can't close the lid, but my battery saving needs are met. \n", "Q: Is disk image encryption slower than partition encryption? I am considering two options to encrypt some data:\n\n\n*\n\n*add a new encrypted partition\n\n*add an encrypted disk image\n\n\nWhich option is faster in terms of disk read/write speed? I suspect that an encrypted disk image would have a worse performance than using an encrypted partition, but I am not sure.\n\nA: An encrypted partition would likely be faster. With a disk image, you're actually accessing two filesystems, one within the disk image, and the one on which the disk image is stored, as well as the technologies needed to read the disk image itself. It seem unlikely that a disk image could ever be faster than full-disk encryption, but you would have to run benchmarks to be certain.\n\nA: As another data point, I tested with a regular non-SSD hard drive via USB3.0 and two volumes, one an encrypted partition and the other an encrypted sparseimage on an unencrypted partition.\nFor large file transfers to the encrypted partition, the speed topped out at about 50MB/s, while transfers to the sparseimage topped out at about 2.5MB/s.\nSo that's about a 20x performance difference which seems pretty extreme but was fairly consistent in my non-scientific tests. Part of the problem could have been that the sparesimage was having to expand itself during the copy operations, but it still seems pretty slow.\nAs a reference, copies to the unencrypted partition ran around 70MB/s.\nTo summarize:\n 2.5 MB/s  encrypted sparseimage on unencrypted partition\n50.0 MB/s  encyrpted partition\n70.0 MB/s  unencrypted partition\n\n\nA: The difference is minimal, from my experience.\nWhen I made a fresh upgrade to Yosemite, I did some tests. I have 16Gb RAM, and 2 internal SSDs - one unencrypted, and one encrypted with FileVault2. On the encrpyted disk, there's a encrypted sparsebundle where Firefox profiles are stored. I can't remembered the numbers, but after comparing the read/write speeds, I choose double encrypted sparsebundle and FileVault2.\nModern CPUs are specially designed circuit to handle AES encryption/decryption. So it only counts for 1-2% additional load on CPU. The speed you will have is ultimately decided by other factors such as CPU (speed/core), RAM (speed/size), drive I/O speed. You have to decide whether the compromise is worth it.\n", "Q: Shuffle by album on iOS-devices? In iTunes and on iPods (excluding the most recent Nano) there is an option to playback a playlist shuffled by album. This option does not exist in \"Music.app\" on iOS-devices. However, since you can play a playlist in order I was thinking that it would be possible to emulate the shuffle by album-behaviour if you somehow managed to sort the playlist in a random by album order and then just play it from the first track with shuffle disabled. This raises two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What determines the sorting order for a playlist on an iOS-device?\n\n*Can you somehow (maybe with an Applescript) sort a playlist in iTunes in a shuffle by album order?\n\n\nA: This is not possible in music.app.\nFrom this Apple Discussion:\n\nThe Foobar2000 music player app available in the App Store respects albums and supports 'Shuffle Albums'. It is a competent, comfortable and convenient music player with full Gain Management and many other useful features. It will work with your iTunes library as well as many other music file formats (via iTunes App File Folders). At time of writing it is free.\n\n\nA: There are a few apps that can achieve this like Cs Music.\nPersonally I prefer to use the Shortcuts app (previously Workflow) to queue up random albums and play them back in order. With a lock screen widget or home screen shortcut this can be done with a single tap.\nLinks to some Shortcuts can be found here, they are quite straightforward to customise if you want to limit to albums within a specific playlist or genre.\n", "Q: Can i manage Yosemite 10.10.2 clients with a 10.9.5 server with workgroup manager? I work at a university and a professor running a lab would like to keep Workgroup Manager but run Yosemite clients. I can not find any specific documentation on this. Except : \"Note: Workgroup Manager and previous versions of Server app are not compatible with Yosemite.\" But I believe that is just that there is no Workgroup Manager that runs on a Yosemite server.\n\nA: Late answer but I thought it might help. Yes, I believe you can still use WGM to administer / set prefs on Yosemite clients. But you should keep your server version as is. I still have OS X Leopard Server running as OD master and WGM for all my client machines running OS X Yosemite. I also use Profile Manager alongside WGM and it works without problems...\n", "Q: In the new Photos OSX app, where is the machine-readable photo information stored? In iPhoto, there was an AlbumData.xml file with information about all the photos like title, filename, etcetera. I was planning to use it from within a Python program to automatically export photos in certain albums to my website.\nWith the new OSX Photos app, I cannot find an AlbumData.xml or a plist file with the same information. The ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Database/apdb/ directory contains serveral .apdb files, which are sqlite databases. I inspected the schema in two of them but didn't find any list of photos. (Note: \"apdb\" stands for \"aperture db\", so it seems Apple re-used quite a bit of aperture in the new Photos app.)\nSo... I want to get my hand on the filenames of my photos, their titles, which albums they're in. Where is this data stored?\n(Googling is very hard because of the generic 'photos' search term...)\n\nA: The \"list of photos\" is in the RKMaster table.\ncd ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Database/apdb\nsqlite3 Library.apdb\nselect modelId,fileName,imagePath from RKMaster;\n\nDo .schema RKMaster to see the other fields of the table.\n", "Q: Partition my HD with Disk Utility, cannot resize the partition WITHOUT installing Windows. WTF? I am installing Ubuntu on my Mac to exist as in parallel with OS X Yosemite, version 1010.3. The screenshot looks similar to previous questions, e.g. How can I resize a partition with Disk Utility?\nHowever, the GUI for Disk Utility does not give me access to resize my partition. Normally, you can click the righthand bottom corner of the volume and drag. I do not have that option---there are no three lines in the bottom righthand for the cursor to drag. \nI cannot manually change the size of the partition in the \"Size\" box. Normally, you could click/highlight the values and change them. I cannot. The text is \"faded\". \nWhy doesn't the Disk Utility GUI allow me to choose the size of the partition? Should I just do this via the Command Line? \nEDIT: Doesn't anyone else think it's weird that Apple (via Yosemite) forces you to download Windows if you want to partition your hard drive correctly? Note to Apple: FIX THIS!!!\n\nA: Here are instructions for undoing a Core Storage conversion (source - this method worked for me). It should be non-destructive, but as always, take a backup first! \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery HD. If for any reason you don't have Recovery HD, then you'll have to make a bootable Yosemite drive and boot into that.\n\n*In the Menu Bar, select Utilities > Terminal.\n\n*Run diskutil cs list. You'll get an output that looks like this (credits to the Ask Different user in my source):\n\n\n\n\n*Select your Logical Volume ID (the one highlighted in the screenshot) and copy it to the clipboard.\n\n*Run the Terminal command diskutil cs revert Paste-Your-Logical-Volume-ID-Here.\n\n*Run diskutil cs list to verify that your computer can't find any CS volumes.\n\n*You're done! Now Disk Utility should be able to do everything you need it to do to your HD!\n\nA: The reason is that with OS X Yosemite, the internal OS X installation is converted to a Core Storage volume, which is still not fully supported by Disk Utility. There is a way to do it on the command-line, but I'd suggest first partitioning your drive using Boot Camp Assistant, then quit once partitioning is complete. This will give you a volume to work with. Obviously reformatting for Ubuntu will be needed. I can provide further assistance if this doesn't work for you.\n", "Q: Safari no longer defaults to typing in address bar. Why? I recently deleted cookies and deleted my AdBlocker for Safari. Since then, things have been acting weird, e.g. websites open slowly, my homepage was set to Yahoo, etc.\nPreviously, when I would open a new tab, the cursor would be in the address bar. Any typing I would do would start there. Now, I must manually click the address bar, or use the Command + L shortcut to go there. \nThat's a pain. How could I reset this? I see nothing in Safari's Preferences. \n\nA: Your system could have been infected with adware and/or malware. See this Apple Support page on how to remove adware.\nFor malware, I have relied on Sophos' free Antivirus for Mac for several years. I use it on my home machines, and my school uses it enterprise-wide on all Mac and Windows desktops, laptops and servers.\n\nA: Under Safari -> Preferences -> Search ->\nUncheck “Include Safari Suggestions”\n", "Q: iPad air 2 screen rotation I just got an iPad Air 2.

After detection I need to calculate the 3D coordinates of those markers, therefore I need the focal length of my camera as this is an input value of the program.\n\nA: What is recommended is doing a camera calibration yourself, using OpenCV for instance, to get reliable figures.\nhttp://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/calib3d/camera_calibration/camera_calibration.html\nIt is not very complicated, just print out the chessboard pattern, tweak the xml file which has input data for information about the test pattern and also the xml for input images(if you plan on using images, instead of live video through your webcam, I recommend the latter) \nRun the sample as it is, following the instructions for keyboard prompts (hold up pattern, press 'g' to start calibration once you see detected lines, esc to exit).\n", "Q: Why can't I mount a Samsung SSD 850 EVO? I just bought a Samsung ATA III SSD drive, the Samsung 850 EVO.  I installed it in an external enclosure that I know works with an ATA II drive, but I don't see the new drive in Disk Utility.

He had no idea when that update would come though. I called back today (7/29/15) for an update, rep was mildly rude, said there will never be an update, and that our only option was Samsung's new USB3 external drives (which are 850 EVOs internally).\nOWC support (7/29/15) says they do not test Samsung SSDs in any of their enclosures.

Gigabytes of data, every time. \nIt doesn't matter what settings the firewall has, I tried them all. The only thing that stops this is to deactivate the firewall (before launching Xcode).\nHas anyone else this effect or an idea what this is about?\n\nUpdate\nI just tried Xcode on a clean install (OS X and Xcode from ADC) and it did not solve it. But it started the scan not when Xcode launches but when a project gets executed (CMD-R). So it starts scanning either when Xcode launches or when executing a project.\n\nA: Xcode is likely trying to use the network. This is triggering a rule in your firewall that results in Xcode's code signature being checked – requiring a read of the complete application bundle.\nExperiment with the following option in OS X's firewall settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences.app > \n\n*Security & Privacy >\n\n*Firewall >\n\n*Firewall Options… >\n\n*Automatically allow signed software to receive incoming connections\nI have this option disabled. As a result, I am frequently prompted to allow Xcode incoming network access. I always deny access as doing so still allows local connections between Xcode and underlying development tools.\nAs a side note, I am unable to reproduce the behaviour you are seeing on OS X 10.10.3 and Xcode 6.3.2.\nAlternative Firewalls\nIf you do decide to disable your Mac's built-in firewall, investigate using a third party alternative such as Little Snitch:  Reasons to prefer Little Snitch over the built-in firewall\n\nA: I did both options (remove from list, uncheck Automatically allow signed software to receive incoming connections), and then had to restart Xcode for the fix to take effect.\n", "Q: How can I add a UTC world clock to my OSX dashboard? In the OSX dashboard, the world clock doesn't have a UTC option. Choosing London only works half of the year (the other half London is on Daylight Savings Time and is UTC+1).\nI could choose Atlantic/Reykjavik, which is always on UTC, but it seems like a hack, and I'd rather have my clock display \"UTC\" instead of \"Reykjavik\".\n\nA: I couldn't figure out these instructions for my High Sierra Machine machine so I installed this Status Clock from Pulsely Consulting:\n\n\nA: There is already a UTC clock available.\nAssuming you're on Yosemite: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your notification center  \n\n*Click Edit at the bottom  \n\n*Add the World Clock and click Done.  \n\n*Hover over the World Clock you just added, and click on the (i) icon.  \n\n*Enter UTC when it asks for City.   \n\n*That's it. You're done.  \n\n\nA: You can edit the source of the world clock widget to add UTC:\ncd /Library/Widgets\nsudo vi WorldClock.js\n\nSince Mac OS El Capitan, the file is now found here:\ncd /Library/Widgets/World Clock.wdgt/\nsudo vi WorldClock.js\n\nThen, in the Europe section, add the line:\n{city:'UTC', offset:0, timezone:'UTC', id:\"2647937\"},\n\nThe \"city\" will become the display name of the clock widget; it can be whatever you like.\nYou may need to remove and recreate any existing clocks in your dashboard for UTC to show up in the list. Since Mac OS Mojave, you will need to kill the DashboardClient process to see the new option (it will restart on its own):\nkillall DashboardClient\n\n", "Q: What does photolibraryd do whenever I log in to my Mac? Whenever I log into my MacBook Pro the CPU cranks up to 100%+ for a few seconds, my board gets hot, and the fans start going.  I open up Activity Monitor to find that the culprit is 'photolibraryd'.  What's going on?  What's it doing that uses so much CPU?\n\nA: It also matches photos that are on your local library and in iCloud. So for instance, if you have a sync problem, you can toggle iCloud Photo Library in Photos app → Preferences → iCloud and this will cause a complete re-sync of the local and the iCloud photos.\nWhen this happens (at least on my 51K photo library), it takes 24 hours or so of photolibraryd running to match photos and sync the changes.\n\nA: In my case photolibraryd wants to conntect to edge.quantserve.com on Port 80 (http), probably to set a tracker-cookie or web-beacon. I stopped this behaviour with Little Snitch.\nFor more information on quantserve, read this guardian-article: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/23/quantcast-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring\n\nA: If Photo Stream is enabled, photolibraryd connects to iCloud and checks for any new photos in your Photo Stream. If there are new photos, they are downloaded and added to the photo library you have selected as your ‘system’ library.\n", "Q: How to tell which iPhone app eats bandwidth? Sometimes I notice that the Internet connection in my house becomes REALLY slow.\nDisabling WiFi on my wife's iPhone fixes this.\nBut how can I tell which app/process does this?\niCloud backup is disabled. Dropbox is not installed. The \"data usage\" report shows cellular data, not wifi, I assume. What do I do? How do I debug this?\n\nA: If your router doesn't have a way to log bandwidth usage, your best bet would be to run every suspect app on its own.\nBy that, I mean you should go into the App Switcher (double-press the Home button) and swipe upwards on all of the apps in that list. That kills all of the apps, so the only ones that'll be running are the ones you open afterwards. Kill all of the apps, then let one run and see if it has any effect on your wifi.\nNot a great solution, I know, but to my knowledge, there isn't an easy way to figure out your problem.\n\nA: You are correct Apple only reports data usage for cellular and not WiFi so you’d need to connect to a WiFi network you control and get the statistics from the router. I like using Ubiquiti Edge Routers that are in the $50 range if you are starting out on managing traffic on a network.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter/\nYou also might just be able to use a service like OpenDNS to track the DNS lookups and figure out the names of the servers being contacted to track the data usage and guess what apps are running. The iOS 12 activity graphs are so much more detailed - hour by hour application usage and details if they are on screen or off screen will severely narrow down which apps are accessing the network. If an app is taking CPU or using energy in the background, you can be sure it’s to do network access.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings app and go to screen time and make your choices about all devices or one device\n\n*Set up the time you want to track and keep a paper record of the apps you actually chose to run\n\n*review the graphs and data for that device during the time you wish\n\n\n\n", "Q: Stop sign when booting from internal ssd, boot goes fine if the ssd is in external case sorry for the long post and my english.\nI have an early 2011 Macbook Pro 13 which I purchased in july 2011 and it worked fine until one week ago. Since when I bought it i replaced the stock hdd with a 240G OCZ Vertex 3 and it never had any problems.\nOne week ago my Macbook crashed while I was working (only the spinning wheel was moving but the system was unresponsive in every other way) so I turned off the computer by pressing the power key. When I turned it on again it showed me a stop sign at boot but after a minute or so it booted up normally. The next day it totally stopped booting, hanging on the stop sign and not moving from there anymore.\nI thought that maybe my ssd failed after 4 years of intense use, so I took it to an Apple Store and the Genius told me that they couldn't do anything apart from replacing my old hdd (which is working fine) but they couldn't assure me they would be able to recover my data (my last backup was old).\nSo I took the stock hdd and installed Yosemite again. The computer booted up normally and started working again. The strange thing was that I was able to look at all my files on the failed ssd (which I put in an external sata to usb enclosure). I tried to repair the ssd because Disk Utility gave me some errors. Then I tried again to boot up from the ssd but I got the stop sign again.\nSo I did this: I took another ssd drive I had and which I was sure was working fine from another pc (it's an OCZ Vertex2 120G). I cloned my working stock hdd and tried to boot up from the Vertex2: i got the stop sign again and couldn't boot up.\nI tried the verbose mode and it didn't gave me any particular message before getting to the stop sign.\nI tried the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset NVRAM, SMC, PRAM or whatever I could reset\n\n*Repairing my ssd with Disk Utility and fsck (no errors)\n\n*Disabling kext-signing, even if I had no TRIM enabled\n\n\nThe last thing I did was to put the ssd in the external sata to usb and try to boot up from there: surprisingly it worked.\nI am now writing from my original ssd with all my files. So far it didn't give me any error and is working just fine.\nI got in touch 2 times with Apple Support and they told me they had no idea and that it must be a hardware failure (?). However, this explanation makes no sense for all the reasons I listed above.\nI am using Time Machine to backup my data but my computer is obviously very slow compared to when the ssd was in the internal slot. I can't use it like this everyday and I need a solution to have it working again.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The problem was a faulty SATA cable. I got a replacement and everything is now working flawlessly.\n", "Q: Sort load of login items I have about 20 login items in my profile, and I often can use Alfred from the very beginning stage of the system start, but sometimes not. Will be great if I can say the system to load Alfred first and then the others.\nIs there anyway of doing this?\n\nA: \nModern OS X installations start the items simultaneously, independent of their visible order, and also use additional mechanisms such as Resume and invisible launch entries which have influence on the start sequence during the login phase.\n\nFrom: http://www.bresink.com/osx/0TinkerTool/history.html\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change the order in which login items execute under OS X 10.8.2?\n\n*How to control order of startup items for users at login?\n", "Q: Is there a docking station product that allows iPad 3 to access internet via an Ethernet connection instead of wireless? I have an iPad 3 which I love but sometimes the Wi-Fi cuts out whilst listening to the radio.  I would like to plug in the iPad to a cradle or docking station which itself has an Ethernet port and so can draw internet directly.  \nDoes anyone know of such a product?\nI guess it needs a mini operating system instead of being just an electrical plug\nPlease don't answer with Bluetooth or other wireless technologies, one problem I have is use in the kitchen and when microwave is working there is a definite drop off in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capability.  I really need a wired solution.\n\nA: In the end I bought an Apple TV.  I solved signal problems in my kitchen by using a Internet over electric mains solution.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Recovery Mode - Headless Access? I have a Macbook Pro, which unfortunately the screen has died on. External displays do not work either.\nI can normally ssh and screenshare into the mac fine, but now need to repair the internal HD. \nIs it possible to screen share or ssh into a machine in recovery mode? \nAt the moment it doesn't seem to be appearing on the network, but I know recovery mode should connect to my wifi. \nIs ssh enabled or can I enable it somehow?\n\nA: Turn the problem upside down. Boot the laptop in target disk mode and use another (working) Mac to access the drive over firewire or thunderbolt. It will behave just like an external drive.\n", "Q: Import Voice Memos back to iOS For some time ago, I've exported my voice memos from my iPhone to my Mac for back-up purposes using iExplorer and deleted the originals.\nNow, again using iExplorer, I tried to copy them back to my iPhone, to their original place although nothing copied showed up under Voice Memos. Probably iOS has a database file concerning the recordings. I've the previous database as well but copying it will for sure mess up the current new recordings under iOS.\nThe web is crowded with how to export your voice memos to your Mac but no one is talking about how to import them back to your iPhone and since my try failed, is anyone aware of a possible solution?\n\nA: You need to sync the voice memos via iTunes:\n\n\nA: I have Apple Music so iTunes (on Windows) doesn't work the way it works when you're syncing your MP3s. I tried to import my voice memos into iTunes but it just wouldn't sync them. Things I tried:\n\n*\n\n*dragging the audio file into the \"Voice Memos\" playlist and syncing but it didn't work.\n\n*discovering the location of the Voice Memos on my filesystem (C:\\iTunes\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Voice Memos), copying them there, and trying to sync\n\nWhat finally worked but that wasn't ideal was:\n\n*\n\n*sending them from my computer via email\n\n*selecting the file and then exporting it to Voice Memos\n\nDrawback was I lost the original file date. I probably could adjust the file date by writing a little app to do that, but this works for now.\n*\n", "Q: Terminal command to arrange all files/folders by name on hard drive Looking to tidy up my iMac.\nLike everyone, I have lots of files/folders on my iMac. When they get dragged and dropped, or moved around, they retain their position, and the only way to fix this is to right click on the mouse select 'Clean up By' > 'Name'\nI'm wanting to run a script in Terminal (or similar) that will do this to every file/folder on my iMac\nE.g.\nDirectory X contains four files\nABC99, ABC45, ABC32, ABC01\nAfter running the script, the folder should contain the same files but in the correct order\nABC01, ABC32, ABC45, ABC99\n\nA: Deleting .DS_Store SHOULD reset the appearance of a folder's content. \nBTW, the problem with the other answer could be the handling of special characters, which in my guess is space. \nFor example, you have a home directory named \"First Last\". In find, the result it pipes out would be:\n/Users/First Last/.DS_Store\n\netc. Try,\nrm /Users/First Last/.DS_Store\n\nwould end in error, because the two properly escaped forms are:\nrm  /Users/First\\ Last/.DS_Store\n\nor\nrm \"/Users/First Last/.DS_Store\"\n\nThe correct way to go about it should be: run\nfind / -name \".DS_Store\"\n\nfirst to list all .DS_Store files.

In my mail message I want to attach an image. I located the image via spotlight and now I want to attach it to my mail message (plain apple mail). The image file is somewhere deep in my folderstructure where I don't want to go now. How can I achieve this with as less effort as possible?\n\nA: As the other answers suggest, you can simply drag and drop into your mail message.  However, I found that this is not always the behavior that I want.  Sometimes I want to see the file in the context of its own folder, or get additional files around it.\nHolding down the Command ⌘ key, while double-clicking on the Spotlight result, will open the containing folder of your image (or any file) in the Finder.  I use this function all the time.\nAs a bonus, just holding the Command ⌘ key will show you the path of the file underneath its Preview, as illustrated in the following screenshot.\n\n\nA: As like in many other places in OS X, items in Spotlight Search are draggable. \nSo You can drag and drop the file You want straight from Spotlight to the mail message.\n", "Q: Do Apple stores refuse to repair your iPhone if not purchased directly from Apple? I am planning to buy an iPhone 6 from an online store. But I have been told that if I buy from anywhere except the Apple store, I won't be able to enjoy the benefits of the warranty and guarantee. Is that true? \n\nA: You can research Apple's warranty at http://apple.com/legal\nYou will have consumer law protections if you can prove you purchased product in a certain place. Those trump any warranty.\nApple's warranty is attached to the phone (or any serialized product), so all that matters is what country that serial number was first sold as Apple's records show. They then warrant that one device under that one legal framework.\nThe warranty doesn't need proof of purchase, but most of the agreements I've read say \"Apple or its agents may require that you furnish proof of purchase details\" which protects them against stolen or counterfeit serial numbers if there is doubt.\nI would recommend you get a written invoice with the business name and the serial number of the iPhone so you are covered in case Apple exercises the \"may require\" clause, but I've never heard of anyone actually reporting that they needed to provide proof of purchase as Apple typically honors their warranty to the letter and often treats consumers better than the warranty allows. \n\nA: Apple will honor the warranty of any device sold from an authorized dealer. If you buy a second hand device from an individual I believe the original warranty is in effect from the original sale date. EG the warranty starts from the time Apple or the authorized dealer sold it to the person you bought it from.\nYour best bet might be to ask someone at an Apple store for a definitive, authoritative answer. Either that or call Apple support.\n", "Q: sudo killall coreaudiod made it so I don't have any sound at all I ran into an issue where my volume buttons on my mac weren't able to adjust the volume of my computer. I sought a solution and someone suggested using sudo killall coreaudiod. Now I have no volume on my computer at all. How do I fix this?\n\nA: This command will do it:\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.audio.coreaudiod && sudo launchctl start com.apple.audio.coreaudiod\n\nDetails\nMartin Strouhal's answer doesn't work for OS X/macOS ≥ 10.12.4 due to removal of com.apple.audio.coreaudiod from system integrity protection's RemovableServices whitelist in /System/Library/Sandbox/com.apple.xpc.launchd.rootless.plist [1].\n\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist: _\n   Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged\n\n\nSo instead of unloading the service, we instead just restart it.\nAlso, the latter command (sudo launchctl start com.apple.audio.coreaudiod) worked to restart the service after I had killed coreaudiod using killall coreaudiod.\n\nA: sudo killall coreaudiod should work to kill your audio drivers. It should reload itself within a fraction of a second.\n(verified on my mbp running 10.14 but used this on a couple of previous versions)\n\nA: You need to reload coreaudiod instead of killing it.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nUPDATE: I tried to reinstall Yosemite but it crashed halfway through so I took it to a Service Centre. They tested the hardware and said it passed all of their tests. They reinstalled Yosemite and now that I've got it back, it still crashes. I've isolated some apps that were crashing, even weeded out the Spigot adware and all that but random crashes still happen. I keep checking the console logs just before I had to reset and the logs are different each time so I'm having a hard time isolating the problem. Is Yosemite really this unstable?\nUpdate: I took the unit to an authorized service center. They cleared it of any hardware issues and reinstalled Yosemite. When I got it back, the crashing continued. I have now updated to 10.10.4.\nI've noticed that crashes only occur when I'm connected to the internet. It's stable when I am offline. Everytime a crash happens, I check the console but the messages before the crash are different each time which has made it difficult to isolate the problem. I have noticed though that awdd crashes very often, I get the deny file-read-data /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security-common.plist often from WebKit.Content, cloud, and a lot of other core apps (i have tried to locate this plist but have been unable to find the exact file) and WARNING: The Gestalt selector gestaltSystemVersion is returning 10.9.4 instead of 10.10.4.

But it does tend to appear at the exact time of a freeze. There's probably something AV-related going on, that also generates that message. I actually found this thread and several others by searching for that message. They're all about the freeze.\nRemember com.apple.WebKit.WebContent is the name of the entire process. Lots of libraries are loaded in that process, WebKit being only one of them. It also doesn't mean other processes (like VLC or iTunes, as mentioned in the original post) can't do the same thing. An AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer is a part of AVFoundation that can be put somewhere in a window to display video, for one thing.\n", "Q: Custom keyboard I created with ukalele not working I created a custom layout with Ukalele.

Is it possible to recover emails from an iPhone 5s that completely disappeared the other day? It is through Outlook Express, have AT&T and it is IOS 7.0.1 version. They were not deleted. I was on my phone back and forth from facebook to email to safari and the \"manage your storage\" message kept popping up. A couple hours earlier, I had deleted some photos from photo roll and text messages to make more room and I was also deleting unwanted emails thinking that would help (which upon further investigation it does not) because I knew my storage was low. I had deleted like almost 2000 emails from Hotmail earlier and I think later when I went into Hotmail it picked up other emails that must have been \"hanging\" out there and when there was room they started updating or downloading but it was when I went into outlook later that 850 emails just disappeared. They are not in trash. I looked into all those iPhone recovery downloads but it doesn't look like they can get emails back. Would iTunes backup work somehow?! Thanks\n\nA: Try to find your archive folder, the emails should be in there and once you find them they can be moved to your inbox. \n", "Q: Can launchd be made to set a different owner on files it creates while executing a .plist job?

This .plist job updates the slocate database specific to my home directory at 5:45 AM daily.  The Umask setting of 077 makes the output file readable only by me.  However, the file is created with the ownership of root; not what I want.\nIs there a way to specify the ownership of the output file instead of the default of root?  I realize I can run this as a LaunchAgent under ~/Library/LaunchAgents, but I prefer the job to run whether I am logged in or not, hence installing it as a LaunchDaemon.\nI'm running OS X 10.10.3 Yosemite.\n\nA: I have a few suggestions. According to to the manual, you can set the UserName key- https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/launchd.plist.5.html. You could use periodic with a shell script to run slocate and change the permissions of the database. Setup a user crontab. A user crontab will only run at the specified time.\n\nA: Instead of /Library/LaunchDaemons use the user based ~/Library/LaunchAgents in your user library. Then the process will be executed as the logged in user, instead of the root account.\n", "Q: How do I reinstall Adobe Design and Web Premium CS6 on my Mac? When I tried to open Photoshop I got a message that files were missing.  Someone (mis?)informed me that I had to uninstall Photoshop and then hit the button to reinstall. Instead the whole file along with Acrobat Pro and a whole bunch of other stuff disappeared. And there was no reinstall button. Is there a simple way to fix this?  I have the license key for the suite.  Do I need anything else?\n\nA: Just download the installation files of the CS6 trial version from Adobe again:\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/en/x-productkb/policy-pricing/cs6-product-downloads.html\nOnce you've installed the trial, you can upgrade it to the full version using your license key.\n", "Q: Notification Center frozen in macbook pro with Yosemite 10.10.3 My notification center is completely frozen.  It's still in the upper right hand corner of my screen, but when I click on it, nothing happens. I do not get any notifications in a popup window when I receive a message from iMessage or Facebook like I had been.  I do still get a little red 1 on my iMessage app in the dock, though.  \nI have seen other forums with people having this issue being able to force quit notification center from activity monitor, but my activity monitor does not show notification center anywhere.  This same problem actually happened to me before few months ago, and after searching FOREVER I found out how to kill the application from terminal.  This does not work for me now, as when I type in \"killall NotificationCenter\" into the terminal it comes back saying \"no matching processes belonging to you were found.\" \nI have spend a bit of time searching forums for this problem again, and have tried typing other things into terminal and they don't work either (killall -3 NotificationCenter; killall -9 Notification Center, some other commands that are supposed to restart all running programs).  I've also rebooted my computer.  \nI just had an update for \"Remote Desktop Client Update version 3.8.4\" that was automatic last night, and I first noticed this problem this morning, so that might have something to do with it. This is very frustrating so if anyone can help me that'd be awesome! I'm not super knowledgeable about computers so please give detailed directions if you can.   \n\nA: The simplest and least destructive way to stop processes that run in your user space is to logoff, and logon again.\nIf you kill a process, it can't save any data correctly. Most system processes have good routines to handle this, but that slows things down the next time it starts and can leave things in a state where you need to clean up the mess by hand.\nLogging out and back in will minimize the risk of causing further issues.\n", "Q: My Bootcamp Windows system can't see my Mac files? I recently got a new MacBook Pro.  On my old computer I had a Bootcamp partition that runs Windows.  Everything installed on the new one fine, but I have a problem.  Why can't I see my Mac files from my Windows system?  On my old computer, I could see and move them while running the Windows system.  The Mac side has no problems accessing my Windows files.\nDoes anybody have a clue what I should change and on which system?\n\nA: The reason is that with the latest version of OS X, the internal drive is converted to a Core Storage volume, rather than the simple HFS+ volume you presumably had on your old computer. Apple still hasn't rolled out support for this in many areas, Windows included. You won't be able to access your files directly anymore from within Windows until Apple gets around to implementing Core Storage in Windows, if they even have plans to do that. The only solution is to use an external drive or create another partition formatted as exFAT or FAT32 as a neutral location that can be accessed by both operating systems.\n", "Q: Is it possible to see what was 'illegal' about my app? I've recently had an app of mine accepted for distribution on the iOS App Store. As usual, I selected to allow for publication on all App Stores. The app was approved and the app was available to download on all the international app stores.\nApproximately 24 hours later, I received the following message in the Resolution Center:\n\nWe are writing to notify you that your application, application name, will be removed from the China App Store because it includes content that is illegal in China, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines :\n22.1 Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users. It is the developer's obligation to understand and conform to all local laws\nWhile your app has been removed from the China App Store, it is still available in the App Stores for the other territories you selected in iTunes Connect.\n\nIs it possible to see what it was about the app that was regarded as illegal?\nI'm not aware of any content of my app that would be regarded as illegal, especially as my app was only removed from the China App Store rather than internationally, and nothing illegal was 'picked up' in review.\nThe app in question is Free Bitcoin (iTunes link).\n\nA: There is no way to gather more insight, other that what Apple tell you directly. Only Apple will be able to answer your question for more information.\nAsk the Apple iTunes Connect team via the Contact Us details:\n\nApp Review\nFind out the status of your app and submit general questions for the App Review Team.\n\nAsk the Apple Review team via the appeal process:\n\nApp Review Board\nThe App Review Board provides the opportunity to appeal the rejection of an app if you believe that the functionality or technical implementation was misunderstood. You can submit additional details to the App Review Board to help them determine if your app should be reconsidered. Sign in to submit an appeal.\n\n\nA: A subsequent app not for Bitcoin but another cryptocurrency, Ethereum Faucet (iTunes link), was approved by app review, then removed from the China store hours later with the following:\n\nWe are writing to notify you that your application, Ethereum Faucet, will be removed from the China App Store because it includes content that is illegal in China, which is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines :\n\n  \n*Legal\n  Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where you make them available (if you’re not sure, check with a lawyer). We know this stuff is complicated, but it is your responsibility to understand and make sure your app conforms with all local laws, not just the guidelines below. And of course, apps that solicit, promote, or encourage criminal or clearly reckless behavior will be rejected.\n  \n  \n  Specifically, the app facilitates the transmission of cryptocurrency, which is not legal in China\nWhile your app has been removed from the China App Store, it is still available in the App Stores for the other territories you selected in iTunes Connect.\n\nIn the two years since asking this question, alongside editing the guidelines with a more detailed description of that point, they also added a new paragraph which seems to detail precisely what is wrong, namely that ‘the app facilitates the transmission of cryptocurrency’. That would seem to be the same reason as the app I asked about in the question.\n", "Q: Installation of Yosemite is interrupted by a white screen at ⅓ of progress bar The loading of the installation from a Yosemite USB installer drive is interrupted by a blank screen about ⅓ into the progress bar.

Alternately, you could try placing that Mac into target disk mode and installing the OS from another Mac.\nTo run a minimal install on that hardware alone, boot to internet recovery or from a netboot server and install onto a known good USB external drive.\nIf that won't work, you'll need to determine why the logic board in a minimal configuration isn't working.\nSorry to offer vague guidance, but documenting how to diagnose and repair a Mac is far too broad for this site.\n\nA: AFIK....Some steps of the Installation process require heavy CPU usage.\nThat is why is it required to have full battery and charger plugged in. System will be consuming a lots of power.\nIn you case \"without battery\" there is not enough juice to continue with the installation.\nIt is well published fact that Macs will automatically cut the CPU power in 1/2 if operating without battery, since the charger is not designed to provide full power needed for the operations.\nThis is a theory, since I have no proof for the statement above.\n\nA: I brought the macbook to an Apple dealer to get it checked.\nThey repaired it under the \"MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues\", and I did not have to pay for it.\nThis means the culprit was the video card.\n\nA: I had same problem of progress bar hanging halfway through startup. MBP early 2011. Visited Genius Bar and the guy there said almost straight away he thought he knew what the problem was. Turns out it is the video card. They are going to replace the main logic board and the video card maker is going to stomp up the cost. Apparently on this laptop there is a known issue.

I'm wondering if I replace its logic board, would it get unlocked or not?!\n\nA: To unlock your phone, you should contact AT&T to do so. It is free and allowed under their ToS, as long as you are eligible.\nPlease see https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/ for more information.\nIf you actually wanted to replace the logic board, you would have to do so from a phone designed to work on the AT&T network and it itself is already unlocked - which would be nearly impossible to determine unless you actually did the swap and/or were provided IMEI information on the device prior to purchase. Considering the complexity of the repair, you'd probably be better off just buying an unlocked whole phone off of Craigslist, etc. due to time and cost involved, as well as risk to the device.\n", "Q: Run 'real VNC Viewer' in full screen mode Full Screen Mode\nAfter updating to Yosemite you can now run applications in 'Full Screen Mode' (Application runs in full screen without the OS X toolbar at the top) if it's supported.\nProblem\nI am running 'real VNC viewer' to access my Raspberry Pi's screen over the network.

You can easily check by looking at the blue bar with the count on it, unplugging the phone and waiting for the change. Then plug it back in.  It confused me as well because I plug my phone onto a desk stand for charging so I hadnt noticed.  One day the office internet was out and I shared my hotspot to my laptop and noticed the count of 2.\nYou might also have a device lying around that you might have forgotten about, like an iPad in your car near your window or an old phone in your desk drawer.  That happened to me once :-)\n\nA: Even without ANY wires, cables, or bulky seams...if you're actually on the hotspot setup screen, iOS appears to bump up the count by one (i.e., showing 2 even though only a laptop is connected), then setting it back down to the \"true\" count once the iOS device is switched to a different screen (i.e., 1 in the example above). \nFWIW.\n", "Q: How do other Macs in the network see my Freenas 9.3 backup drive attached to iMac via Ethernet? I have a Time Machine back up setup on a Freenas 9.3 server. It works really slowly via WiFi attached to my broadband router. So, I attached it directly to my iMac via Ethernet instead - a full backup takes less than 2 hours now. Problem is how can other Macs on the network see the Freenas server through the IMac Ethernet connection via WIFI? I know the IP address of the Freenas server but can't figure out how I can Time Machine back up my Macbookair via Wifi?\n\nA: Solution found:\nOn the iMac, we must first enable port forwarding by entering the following command in Terminal:\necho \"rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 12345 -> 192.168.2.x port 548\" | sudo pfctl -ef -\n\nreplace 192.168.2.x with whatever your FreeNAS is reporting as its IP address. You will also have to enter your account password when prompted. Now, in the Finder on your laptop, connect to your iMac's IP address (192.168.1.x) by typing command + k and entering afp://192.168.1.x:12345/. replace 192.168.1.x with whatever your iMac's IP address is, but keep :12345 as it's needed to connect to your FreeNAS. You may have to select the correct disk from a list. You should now be able to add it as a Time Machine disk on your laptop.\n\nA: If possible, it will be easier to connect the Freenas box and iMac to the router; or if all machines are gigabit capable, you could plug both machines to a gigabit switch (cheap and easily available) and then connect the switch to the router. Either way you'll have a fast wired connection to your backup and the router will handle the, ahem, routing.\nThis way you don't have to leave your iMac on to have the NAS available.\n", "Q: Cannot update apps Cannot seem to update apps or download from iTunes on my iPad Air anymore. If I hit Update on an app, the circle appears, then just goes back to update status. Same applies if I want to download something: the circle appears and then goes back without doing anything.\n\nA: According to Gotta Be Mobile, this problem comes up from time to time across various versions of iOS. I'm experiencing it now on iOS 9.3.3.\nIn my experience, I went to update several apps, only a few actually downloaded. Other ones would show a progress indicator for one second and return to sayIng Update. It also seemed like I couldn't search for apps or see descriptions of apps that showed up on the Featured page after going to those apps pages.\nThe Gotta Be Mobile site listed three suggestions. The first, which is rebooting the iPhone, seemed to fix the problem, but only temporarily. \nThe second, try tapping the update button a lot of times and it might eventually work, actually worked for me, and once it started downloading an app, the App Store in general appeared to begin working better for me.\nThe third solution they suggest is just to wait it out, that the problem tends to go away with time or future updates.\nAnd of course, you could use iTunes to install updates if you need to.\nFor me, for the time being, I just have a bunch of Update buttons that sometimes work when I tap it, sometimes doesn't, and I hope the problem goes away soon.\n\nA: Did you try to visit the app's page in AppStore and hit the update button there?\n\nA: I experienced the same problem, however it got resolved after following this step. \nSettings > iTunes and App Store > tap on your Apple id > select Sign Out and then Sign In again.\n", "Q: Can google inbox on iPhone NOT show contact pictures I am using the google inbox app for iPhone.

I recently edited a picture in preview by adding text to it. I then saved it, not realizing that the original would not be saved (without the text). When I went in to the picture later to delete the text, it was not possible. Is there a way I can either recover the original photo or delete the text I already saved?\n\nA: There is a way to remove text from a picture that you have added with Apple's Preview application.\nOpen the picture with Preview, try to find as area where the background is the same as where the text is. \n\n\n*\n\n*Select an area with the mouse, and copy it and paste it into the picture. \n\n*It will pop up in the center of the picture.\n\n*Use the mouse to move it over the text.\n\n*You can paste it several times as needed.\n\n*Save and quit the application.\n\n*Re-open Preview and Open Previous. \n\n\nSelect the picture you just edited and the text will be gone.\n\nA: I ran into the same situation and figured out that you can remove and undo the addition of the text by simply going to drop down under File and selecting \"Revert To\" and then selecting \"Browse All Versions\".  There you will be able to select the version without the text.  Hope this helps!\n\nA: That is one Problem with Preview that needs fixing by Apple.\nIt will unfortunately without warring overwrite your original.\nThere is no way to restore the original.\n\nA: If you have access to Photoshop CS5 or newer, you might try one of the selecting tools to select the text and use Content Aware Fill and/or the Clone Stamp Tool to remove the text. (This does not make your text editable, but the text can still be removed) \nOne way is to sample the text color with the Eyedropper Tool. Use Select > Color Range. Use Select > Modify > Expand.. (about 2 piksels to cover the antialiasing). Deselect other parts of the image with the same color. Then use Content Aware Fill. Redo Content Aware Fill or use Clone Stamp Tool on problem areas.\nOlder Photoshop versions and Gimp (free) also have a Clone Stamp Tool (not Content Aware Fill).\n\nA: Open image in photos, click on image in tool bar, click on show edit tools. Once that opens look for revert to original image and click on that. Close show edit tools and it should revert back to the original photo.  It worked for me to remove text.  Hope this helps.\n", "Q: How can I add an Automator application to the Dock? I followed the directions in How to put a custom launcher in the Dock (Mavericks) but my case has a different twist. I have an Automator application which runs a shell script that (1) changes the stack size with ulimit and (2) runs an application. I would like to add this to the Dock. I can run it from the Launchpad and everything works correctly. It shows up in my Dock, but only as the application, not the Automator version. As a result, if I right click and enable 'Keep in Dock', then close and run again, the stack limit change of (1) is ignored. How do I put an icon in the Dock which runs the Automator application and not just the application?\n\nA: Just drag and drop the app_name.app bundle created in Automator onto the Dock where you want it.\n", "Q: How to recover User ID snapshot file?

When I enable Show Connected Server in Finder preferences on Desktop, they have icons for this disk on desktop.\nHow do I add this link into favorites in Finder sidebar?\nIn section Servers there is a general link to Share Disk and I need link to a specific folder for every logged-in user as a link on their Desktops.\nAre there best practices I should be following? \nWithout practise when every user drag and drop the link from desktop to favorite? My users every day change the working place and this practise is wrong.\nthanks for all answers.\n\nA: I found out, that the following process adds a folder mounted on a samba share to the sidebar/favorites in my finder. They 'survive' a restart of my mac. I guess they also work as intended if you reboot the NAS/server/whatever. To achieve that, do execute the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the shared folder (it should be listed in the sidebar under 'Shared' within the finder).\n\n*Within the finder, go to View -> Show Path Bar\n\n*Navigate to the folder within your SMB share so that you are in the folder that you wish to add to the sidebar.\n\n*Grab the icon at the bottom above your status bar left of the name of the folder you are in and drag it to your sidebar.\n\n*With a click on this sidebar folder you should land/stay in your desired folder on your samba share.\n\n*(optional step) Go to View -> 'Hide Path Bar' if you don't like this additional information.\n\n\nA: Your question is a bit hard to follow but if I understand it, you are mounting a deep path from the SMB share, but the root of that share is listed under 'Shared' in the sidebar. This is expected behavior and I don't believe you can change it. \nIt's also in theory possible to add items to the sidebar by modifying ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SideBarLists.plist , but this is a non-trivial task because the entries include several items encoded in an undocumented format. A good overview of this is linked in this comment on a similar question. \nI would suggest trying to copy some known-good entries from this plist and seeing if they are portable, but if every user is going to be adding different locations that's probably not viable. There also doesn't seem to be any Applescript facility for this, either.\nI would suggest looking in to creating these shortcuts as dock items or simple aliases in a folder, instead of trying to crack the sidebar enigma.\n", "Q: WiFi problems after wake up (MBP2011 OS X 10.10.3) Suddenly yesterday my mac started to have WiFi-problems.

I want to share our account because we both use the reminders, photos, notes, etc., and when I tried to set up a new apple ID, it nearly took those away.

Same ID, but different, separate users.  How is it done?  Please and thank you! \n\nA: The apple ID is the user.  At some point you'll need to bite the bullet and create new apple IDs for each user if you want separate texts/email accounts etc.\nMy wife and I use a multitude of applications that can share data across accounts, like\n\n\n*\n\n*Anylist for reminders/grocery lists, etc (this can be integrated with the Reminders app\n\n*Photostream for photos\n\n*Google Docs for notes\n\n\nAlso, since iOS 8 you've been able to share applications purchased on any apple ID as long as they have the same credit card on file - so if my wife buys an application, I can download it for free, and vice versa.  It's unfortunate that they still don't support sharing app data, but maybe that's in the works.  Regardless, you will continue to run into problems down the road if you don't separate out your accounts with new Apple IDs.\n", "Q: Can I have multiple wifi networks on a single MacBook Pro? [[GoPro]] I'm looking to connect three GoPro cameras at the same time. Each GoPro needs its own network, and my computer needs to access all of them at the same time. Also, my computer needs a fourth wireless network of its own for accessing and uploading images to the internet. \nCan I do this? Is it possible to have multiple connections going on at once? Is there a USB wireless adapter I could buy that would accept multiple wifi cards?\nEDIT: I need to access both GoPros at the same time. If I have gopro1 and gopro2, each with their own wifi configuration, I can only access one network at a time via my computer's dropdown wifi menu. Is there any way to connect to multiple GoPro networks at the same time? I need my computer to have it's own network so I can pull photos from each GoPro simultaneously.\n\nA: Assuming those cameras work like the ones I've used, all you do is connect your computer and the cameras to the same Wi-Fi router, and you'll be able to do everything normally, on one network. You should never have to create multiple physical networks like that unless you're setting up a corporate network, with multiple access points.\n", "Q: Use a USB sound card with multiple input lines in apps like Skype or Dictation? I need a way to make apps use the second input line from USB sound card. By default the all use input one. Does anyone know how to split the two input channels into two separate devices or alternatively merge the to inputs into one input channel?\nIt seems like OS X is treating the two channels as one Stereo channel instead of two separate inputs.\nBackground information\nI have a lexicon Alpha sound card. It has two input lines, The first for instruments and the second for a microphone.  I'm able to see both lines in audio MIDI  setup. If I go into the system preferences I see both lines as one input device and I can see the sound bar move if I speak in the microphone or put jack table in the instrument plug.\nIf I use Skype or dictation or hangouts or any other normal app only the instrument input is used. If I use Audacity the input is recorded as one stereo channel with the instrument on the left channel and the microphone on the right channel only.\n\nA: In Audio Midi Setup, you may have the choice of which is the primary input in non-ASIO applications…\n\nAlternatively, it might be possible to rearrange the inputs if you use an Aggregate device \n\nI've only used Aggregates for testing, experimentation, so I'm no expert - but it appears you can renumber the channel order by clicking the individual channels in the top section.\n", "Q: How can I get v6.3 Command Line Developer tools to install?

Before upgrading the SSD from Mavericks to Yosemite all was hunky-dory. I could restart between the two OS's using the start-up drive selector in the system folder. Now I have gone to 10.10.3; when I switch from Yosemite to SL and restart from the conventional drive I cannot see the SSD Yosemite Drive in system prefs only the Snow Leopard drive is visible (and the network option) \nRestarting FROM SL and resetting the PRAM eventually brings me back to Yosemite.\nOR\nusing the sudo bless command -mount /Volumes/\"name of 10.10.3 start-up drive\" -setboot\nfollowed by a sudo shutdown -r now\nalso gets me back into 10.10.3\nHowever I dont like doing this as it feels rather the same as pulling the plug; the Mac is not going through it's correct shut-down process.\nA long conversation with Apple arrived at the suggestion I should re-install SL something I do not want to do - too drastic + I may not be able to get back to what I have.\nSo two questions:\n1/. is there a 'gentle' way in terminal I can 'command' the mac to restart from the SSD\nand\n2/. Is there a way I can 'replace' the start-up info for SSD\n\nA: Installing Yosemite converted your hard drive to a Core Storage logical volume, and CS was only introduced in Lion (Wikipedia), so it makes sense that Snow Leopard would have no idea what to do with it. Here's how you undo CoreStorage (source - this method worked for me). It should be non-destructive, but as always, take a backup first! \nAlso, note that any reinstall of Yosemite will re-Core Storage-ify your drive and require you to do this procedure again, and software updates might too. If the issue comes back after a reinstall or update, just go through this process again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery HD. If for any reason you don't have Recovery HD, then you'll have to make a bootable Yosemite drive and boot into that.\n\n*In the Menu Bar, select Utilities > Terminal.\n\n*Run diskutil cs list. You'll get an output that looks like this (credits to the Ask Different user in my source):\n\n\n\n\n*Select your Logical Volume ID (the one highlighted in the screenshot) and copy it to the clipboard.\n\n*Run the Terminal command diskutil cs revert Paste-Your-Logical-Volume-ID-Here.\n\n*Run diskutil cs list to verify that your computer can't find any CS volumes.\n\n*You're done!

As an analogy, you can shut down a road temporarily to stop traffic, but long term, you want to control access to the road itself and not stop all traffic because some users are abusing or overloading the roadway.\n", "Q: Cannot sort by Events in Mac Photos My photos are no longer organized by Events in the new Mac Photos. How do I search the new Mac Photos by events?\n\nA: Upon conversion your iPhoto events have been transformed into Albums.  \nIn Photos there are no events anymore since iPhoto Events and Albums overlapped in functionality.  There is automatic sorting by Location and Date Information (something like \"Automatic Events\") and you can still create Albums if you want to collect Photos.\n", "Q: Where is the file .vimrc in macOS?

Am I doing something wrong? Is it the wrong vimrc file? Does it mean the vimrc file is in a different directory if it was downloaded from homebrew?\n\nA: If you use vim before the installation, the file .vimrc should be on your $HOME directory (/Users/your-username/.vimrc).

However, with the 2 sticks inserted (I tried all slot combinations several times), I occasionally got a memory warning.\nI then took out one of the sticks, and ran my imac on 4GB. Worked perfectly for a week, no kernel panics.\nI then re-inserted the ram stick, and Kernel panics again.\nI am now using only the other ram stick, several days now, and again, perfect performance, no panics.\nSo it seems to me that the 2 sticks work fine, individually, but can't seem to work toghether. They are both identical, Elpida 4GB sticks that shipped with the imac.\nDoes anyone know if this is a RAM issue or a problem on my iMac? What should I do? I need my 8GB.\nThanks in advance,\nAlbert C.\n\nA: I would start with blaming the RAM. If it is possible to return both of them and get a replacement, I would do that.\nThe only way to tell if it is the RAM or the slot is to try different RAM. The problem with that is if you show up at an Apple store with 3rd party RAM installed saying that you have a bad slot, they will take out the 3rd party RAM and say \"problem solved.\"\nOne option is to return the RAM for a refund and buy new RAM from another vendor, but if it fails you'll likely get a similar reaction from an Apple Genius.\nIt's a bit of a Catch-22 unless you can get an Apple genius to test your Mac with some Apple branded memory. Not sure if that is possible or not.\n", "Q: corrupted library (?) preventing ipad upload to icloud photos My ipad was not downloading photos from icloud photos, and was stuck uploading xxx photos. I tried turning icloud photos (and photo stream etc) on and off, and restarting the ipad, with no change in behavior. I then turned off icloud photos, deleted every photo off the ipad, turned it on and noticed that now, it says it is uploading 5 photos. These photos appear to not exist (the library is empty, the deleted files album is empty, and i have removed all albums, and are not visible either using image capture or windows) and I presume this is the source of my sync problems.\nI then backed up the ipad, and restored from backup, and the problem persists.\nI have one thing left to try that I can think of - restore as new and re-install from scratch - but this will be painful. Can anyone suggest an alternative?\nThanks\nChris \n\nA: I can only tell you that I have the same problem, but on my iPhone. The only time I get it to work is when I turn iCloud entirely on and off. Yet – after a successful sync with all images and videos everywhere, the sync problem reemerge. Your mileage may vary. Try a complete iCloud off/on (and – I would recommend – a reboot in between) and see what happens. \n", "Q: My MacBook won't recognize my external hard drive (Passport - that I use to back up the Mac!) I'm not techie at all.\nBut I manage the basics.\nI've always backed up my MacBook (2009) on a Passport.  I just plug it in while the Mac is connected to power source & click the icon & it backs up.\nTonight - the Mac doesn't even see the Passport?\nI have tried & tried.\nThe computer has been acting up in strange ways (not connecting to internet, lots of \"spinning wheel of death\", slow to open apps & slow to change apps) so now I am terrified.\nHelp?\n\nA: By \"Passport,\" I am assuming that you are referring to a Western Digital external drive, which you have been using to perform regular backups. I'm guessing that by \"backups,\" you have been using Time Machine.\nConsidering that this is a new issue, it is fair to say that the external drive has been formatted correctly for use with Mac OSX (i.e., Mac OS Extended (Journaled)). FYI, if you wanted to confirm the File System, then you can use the Disk Utility to display Info about the drive.\nThe first rule of troubleshooting is to obtain a known working device, which you can substitute to test and narrow down where the problem lay. So in this case, get access to another external hard drive (perhaps from a friend), and see if it can be accessed.\nHowever, you observe physical issues with your MacBook, such as \"spinning noise\" and it being unresponsive (slow). Unfortunately, this is a classic symptom that the hard drive within the MacBook is failing. Again FYI, if you wish to inspect the processes on your system to potentially identify other issues, then use the Activity Monitor.\nAssuming that the hard drive within the MacBook needs to be replaced, the good news is that the Time Machine backup on the Passport can be used to restore your system after the repair.\n", "Q: Unlock iPhone from Japan to Kazakhstan Is there any way I can unlock an iPhone 6 in Japan and use it in Kazakhstan?\nI heard from reading other forums that it's got to be unlocked, but aside from that how can I be sure it will work back in Kazakhstan? \nAlso what are the cons of buying and using in different country?\n\nFollowing some answers, to clarify\nI know where to get an unlocked iPhone 6. I want to use the iPhone 6 in Kazakhstan. The cost of iPhone 6 is expensive in Kazakhstan. Want to buy it in Japan and bring it to Kazakhstan to use. \nI want to make sure the unlocked iPhone 6 I buy in Japan can be used with networks in Kazakhstan, and if there's any disadvantages to this approach as opposed to buying the iphone 6 in Kazakhstan.\nThank you.\n\nupdate 27/05/2015\nfound this link: http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/ but it doesn't mention Kazakhstan, so not very assuring.\n\nA: If you buy a mobile phone that is locked to a carrier (as is common practice in the US), then you can only use it on that carrier. If you buy an unlocked mobile phone, then you can use it on any carrier. This is true for all mobile phones, including the iPhone.\nIt sounds like getting an unlocked iPhone in Japan might be difficult, but other Asian countries only sell phones unlocked, as it is illegal for a carrier to lock them in those countries. (This is certainly the case in Thailand, where I live.)\nHong Kong and Singapore also sell all their iPhones unlocked.\nIt sounds like you might be better off sourcing a phone from one of those countries. It might be possible to buy an iPhone on the 'grey market' in Japan also, but if you do, make sure that you test that the phone works with SIM cards from two different carriers, and that it is not jailbroken, before you buy it. This is because a jailbroken iPhone can be 'software unlocked' to use with any carrier, but doing an OS update in the future would then return the phone to its previous locked state.\nMy recommendation is to buy an iPhone from a reputable dealer in a country that does not lock its phones (e.g. Hong Kong). Note that unlocked phones are much more expensive than locked phones.\n\nA: [edit] Apparently the questioner didn't actually mean \"Is there any way I can bu[y] an iPhone 6 in Japan And use it in Kazakhstan?\" when he wrote that, but merely wanted to ask how to buy an unlocked iPhone in Japan. Here is a link to do so: http://kakaku.com/item/J0000013571/\nOriginal answer below.\n\nYes, you can use a Japanese iPhone in Kazakhstan. You don't have to unlock it either. Calls to Japan cost 380 yen/minute, and calls within the country cost 80 yen/minute (more for SoftBank). You can't or shouldn't use data.\nSources: au, docomo, SoftBank\nYou can buy unlocked iPhones in Japan but it will cost a lot more to sign up with a Japanese phone company, so I don't know why you would want to.\nI'm not sure what you mean by the third part of your question. You should buy a cell phone plan in the country that you spend most of your time in. If you don't have a way of paying your bills to a Japanese cell phone company, you should buy your phone elsewhere.\n", "Q: How to switch between multiple fullscreen windows of same application in OS X?

As Mongolian Cyrillic is written left to right and has a small alphabet, I would have thought it'd be easy to implement even if the audience is fairly small.\n\nA: There are no Apple solutions for adding keyboards or fonts, only third party. Search the app store for Mongolian and try the Keyman app.  Unfortunately you have to upgrade to iOS 8 to have a keyboard that operates for the entire OS and not just via copy/paste.\nNobody here can tell you why Apple hasn't included some feature you want, but you can ask for it via\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback\n", "Q: Is firefox hiding from the energy monitor? Since Firefox 38, it is no longer showing in the activity monitor in the energy tab, are other people experiencing this?\nHow can a process hide from the energy monitor in the first place?

I would like to install some particular applications, which I have on one iPad, to another iPad (I don't want to copy all applications and copy settings, so iCloud backup will not work here). The same Apple ID is used on both iPads.\nI thought that I can do it thru iTunes applications installed on my Macbook. But it doesn't display all applications installed on my first iPad, synchronization also doesn't help.\nI understand that I can manually install needed applications on the second iPad, but there about 30 of them. \n\nA: If you have both iPads registered with the same AppleID and syncing does not put all of them on both devices try this.\nOpen the App store and search for the apps that are on the other iPad that you want on this one. In place of a buy/get button should be a cloud with a downward pointing arrow on it. Tap that to install it on that iPad.\nIf the button says Buy or Get then the App store thinks this iPad is on a different account associated with a different AppleID.\n", "Q: Does upgrading Yosemite risk losing material on HD? What are the risks of losing what's on my hard disc--especially programs--when I update Yosemite?\n\nA: Low as this does get tested before.\nWhat is not tested as much is does each application work with the new OS. Apple can only test major apps it is the responsibility of the App's developer to test their app with the new OS and not all have the time to do this.\nBut as always with any computer change take backups as there is always a chance of something going wrong.\nI assume that changing something will break something else. When it does I have to work out if it is worth living with that problem or revert to the old version.\nAnother example is professionally in enterprise software when I install a new version of my program I have to provide a tested process that will reverse the change as stopping something working can cost money\n\nA: The risks to a system being able to boot again are highest when you make fundamental changes to the OS as part of an upgrade.\nThis is due to three factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*some parts of the code base are only called when swapping in and out a new system so those code paths don't run normally. Any degradation of the files (bit rot) will be discovered, but not necessarily caused at upgrade time.\n\n*any change has a very small chance of failing - more change, more chance\n\n*you run new migration steps from the vendor and they could run poorly or not anticipate the changes you have made to your system and cause data loss. This is mitigated by storage idioms like putting all user settings and app data in folders where the OS doesn't install any files. (i.e. the system is designed to not break thusly)\n\n\nThe risk to your data files is no higher during an upgrade than otherwise. If you don't care to back up the files anyhow, then you're always one disk error or drive failure away from losing data. If you have a good backup, you mitigate all the risk of upgrading other than the time you spend wiping and reinstalling the old system / old backup.\n", "Q: Yosemite: prevent 'Bring All to Front' behaviour on Command-Tab On Yosemite, using Command+Tab will bring all the windows of the selected application on top of everything else, similarly to using 'Window->Bring All to Front' when inside the application.\nNote that Yosemite does manage interleaved windows, when manually clicking on background windows. It is possible to have two applications A and B, each with two windows each, and have (front-to-back) A1, B1, A2, B2 interleaved windows.\nHowever, when using Command+Tab to select application A(or clicking on the application icon in the dock) will bring A1 and A2 on top of everything else.\nIt would be really nice to be able to only bring on top the last used window of a given application (namely A1), instead of all of them, hence preserving the interleaving of the other windows. \nI'm not looking for Command-Tab to display all existing windows of all applications (like Witch, proposed in other answers), just not to bring all windows to front. and would like to avoid using Exposé/Mission Control (which requires more inputs).\nInterestingly, I can already use SpotLight search with 'Terminal' for example, and this will bring the last active Terminal window in front, but not the other ones. This is what I would like to happen when using Command+Tab.\nDo you know if there is any way to do this?

The iCloud calendars in my iOS Calendar app do not sync manually (for at lest a couple years now). In order to get them to sync, I need to trigger a manual sync by selecting the list of calendars in the iOS app, and dragging down and releasing. This reliably works to trigger a sync, but I see no setting in the app to sync automatically. Sometimes changing or adding an appointment in the iOS app will also trigger a sync, but not always.\nIs there a way to get iCloud calendars to sync automatically with the iOS Calendar app?\n\nI have tried rebooting all devices. Logging off iCloud and logging back in, and restoring and rebuilding the installation on my iOS device. Nothing helps.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  I remembered that I was having battery problems, so I switched \"Fetch\" to manual mode.  Even though iCloud is setup as PUSH, the calendar seems to be overridden by the \"Manual setting for Fetch.\nSettings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars - Fetch New Data - Change Fetch from Manual to one of the durations.\nOnce I did this, and made a calendar change on the Mac, it was immediately reflected in the calendar on the phone.\n\nA: I belive, you just have to turn on \"Calendar\" in System Settings > iCloud on all devices you want them to stay in sync.\n", "Q: iOS app for marking businesses on a personalized map I need an app for iPhone (iOS 8) that would:\n\n\n*\n\n*allow me to save places on a map and group them by categories (e.g. restaurants, bars, clubs, ...)\n\n*be more useful if I could change the name of the locations and add some comments to remember details of the place\n\n*filter by categories and geolocation (e.g. to see only restaurants or only bars that are close to me)\n\n\nA: Sounds like an opportunity to create an app!\nGoogle Maps allows you to save your own maps (My Maps) where you can add locations and place short notes about them. You can not categorize or sort.\nWith Yelp, you can save locations and make notes, but its limited beyond those features.\nThe closest I have seen to what you are seeking is an app and website called Findery. It is a mapping app that allows you to save and create notes on specific locations. you can include links, videos etc if you like. While these notes are meant to be 'found' by others, you can make them private.

I was booting holding the option key and I was able to choose between the OS X and Windows partitions.\nHowever, Bootcamp does not provide drivers to read Core Storage disks.

Is there a way to update my iPhone 5s when my storage is almost full?\n\nA: Every update also shows how much space is needed. It will also check that for you when you try to update and let you know.\nIf you have some free space, but not enough to update over the air, you can either update using iTunes or delete content manually from your device. Whether you use iTunes or update over the air, you'll have the same amount of free space on your device after you update.\nBefore you start make sure you know your AppleID and password.\n\nA: To clarify what Buscar웃SD said, quoted below, it may be more possible using iTunes simply because when you do an OTA (over the air) update, you have to first download the large installer to your phone which then has to unpack itself into the phones memory and still have space to process all the instructions and install itself into the phone. Space has to be available for that to happen in that case where as if it is downloaded to your computer, you stand a better chance.\n\nEvery update also shows how much space is needed.

From time to time I mark text in the Terminal window to copy(right click or cmd+c) onto the clipboard.\nFor some reason it suddenly stopped working! I can not mark text in the terminal window anymore by clicking and dragging the mouse. I have been looking for a way to turn marking off an on(on Windows Command line tool there is such a setting for some reason), but I cannot find any option for controlling this.\nEven though it is not possible to mark with the mouse, I can select \"Edit\"-\"Mark everything\"(freely translated from the Norwegian OSX version :)) from the file menubar at the top of the screen - and mark everything works fine. I can see everything marked and I can copy and paste as expected. There is however no way I can affect the marking with the mouse - after marking everything it cant be unselected with the mouse. \nDoes anyone have any tips for how to enable marking with clicking and dragging the mouse again? \n\nA: Sometimes things go wonky in the preferences files and you need to delete them to get things working properly again. Once you restart the app, it will rebuild it's preferences.\nTry this:\nQuit Terminal completely and then delete this file:\n(your home folder)/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist\nHopefully that works for you! If you can't see your library folder, follow this quick guide.  \n\nA: It's possible that mouse events are captured by the program running in the terminal. For that to happen:\n1) The program must be written to support mouse (vim and tmux are both examples of such programs), and\n2) Terminal must be in Mouse Reporting mode. This mode is enabled by default.\nIf you disable Mouse Reporting (View/Allow Mouse Reporting, ⌘R), mouse events will not be captured regardless of whether the application supports mouse or not, and you will be able to select and copy text.\n\nA: I had this problem and solved it just by quitting the terminal completely and opening it again.\n", "Q: How can I turn off responses to Calendar invites?

With \"showing all non-printing characters\" off, it looks ok other than some strange font changes. Turning on \"showing all non-printing characters\" shows formatting that makes it look right but it is clearly not the formatting typed in by a person. An example - The original document had line numbering every five lines. This version seems like it has line numbering but they are just characters. It has a section break just before each 5th line. To make a modest sized edit I am exporting it all as text and starting over putting in the formatting. Any idea how this could happen? Might this have come from OCRing a PDF? Any magic way to correct it?\n\nA: Yes, that sort of formatting sounds like what can happen when your OCR software is set to interpret what it has scanned, when in fact you really just need the plain text for applying styles.\nA long time ago on a Windows system, we had to recover an electronic document from the sole remaining printed copy that we had. The software had a marquee feature, where it would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scan the page and show you the preview\n\n*Allow you to draw rectangular marquees over the portions that you were interested in (this was a convenient tool for ignoring scan fragments)\n\n*Produce text fields that contain the scanned text\n\n*Provide a button that would copy the text to the Clipboard\n\n\nThe thing about copying to the clipboard, if you clicked the button, then some interpreting took place that introduced passable formatting, but you no longer had plain text.\nHowever, in step (3), if you drag-selected the text within the paragraph field and manually copied to clipboard, then you'd get plain text, for which to was easier to assign styles.\nWith respect to Mac software, try a demo for the latest Adobe Acrobat, and see if it can do a decent job doing OCR on a screenshot/scan of those Word files.\n", "Q: Unable to reach Startup Manager or any boot options on OSX Leopard I have 5 year old 17\" MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard that, without any warning, is suddenly unable to locate its startup disk. I've tried every possible boot key combo, but only zapping NVRAM works, everything else results in a grey screen including the startup manager and diagnostics.\nDefinitely not the hard drive or hardware. I plugged the disk into another computer and it functions perfectly.\nAny ideas or help appreciated.\n\nA: There is a partition on your hard drive called EFI. At boot up your system looks for the EFI as very first step.\nEFI is responsible for the booting process, and if it is broken for some reason the computer wont boot at all.\nUsing your hard drive on another computer wont tell you if the EFI is still intact since it is not used in that set up. EFI is about 200 Meg in size and it is normally hidden partition. You would have to unhide it in the Disk Utility to see it.\nSo what can you do about the EFI?\nRepair your disk using something like iPartition tool, or simular.\nDo it manually: You can recreate the EFI System Partition (ESP) using the command-line gpt tool. \nOr, if you have a full back up in the iCloud, you could wipe the disk and start over or run the OS X restore (use cmd+r) during boot.\nSome Macs that came with OS X Snow Leopard can use Internet Recovery after installing OS X Lion or later and a software update.\n", "Q: Uninstall rEFInd 0.8-3.7 on Yosemite I recently tried installing rEFInd on Yosemite using the command ./install.sh --alldrivers however it would not recognise the ubuntu 14.04 x64 for Mac disk I made and so I would like to uninstall rEFInd.\nI have tried removing rEFInd from the EFI directory, however the EFI directory does not exist.

The new preferred method is to install rEFInd into the an EFI partition. My answer, to an unrelated question, outlines this new preferred method to start the rEFInd Boot Manager and Linux operating systems. The answer, given below, applies to Yosemite (OS X 10.10) and possibly earlier versions of OS X. \n\nPersonally, I installed rEFInd on my computer to its own partition. This prevents the problems you are encountering. Everything ./install.sh installed went to this partition. If I want to remove rEFInd, I can simply erase or remove the partition. Of course both are unnecessary, because I can turn rEFInd on and off at will. I just go to the Startup window in System Preferences select my boot partition. This computer has OS X, Windows, Fedora and rEFInd installed.\n\nI also can select the boot partition under Windows by using BootCamp and by holding the Option key down at startup. The command diskutil list produces:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Marlin                  300.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data Coelacanth              98.9 GB    disk0s4\n   5:                  Apple_HFS Linux HFS+ ESP          209.7 MB   disk0s5\n   6: 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4               524.3 MB   disk0s6\n   7:                  Linux LVM                         98.6 GB    disk0s7\n   8:                  Apple_HFS rEFInd                  939.5 MB   disk0s8\n\nNote, the rEFInd partition is ~ 1 GB in size. In fact, it can be as small as 100 MB. When I setup this computer, I used the Disk Utility application to create the rEFInd partition. If I would have used the gpt command, I could have created a smaller partition. Neither OS X, Windows, Fedora nor rEFInd use the EFI partition to boot the computer. In fact, there is nothing useful in the EFI partition.\nAnswer to your questions:\nHow do I uninstall rEFInd 0.8-3.7 using OS X 10.10.3? Read the ./install.sh file and undo whatever it did. I should of had you run the commands bless --info and bless --info  --getBoot. These would have told where the .efi file was stored. Note: Almost everyone installs rEFInd to the OS X boot partition.\nHow would I go and reinstall it using different options if I cannot remove it? The author of the software never said rEFInd could not be removed. I suggested you just install it again to its own partition. This might be a good place to mention the gpt command has to be run while either booted to an external recover partition or while booted to internet recovery.\nCould I simply remove the EFI partition or would that corrupt my Mac? Do not remove the EFI partition! It is not used to boot OS X, but it is used by OS X for other things.  \n\nA: diskutil list | grep EFI | awk '{print $6}'\n\nThis will only output the lines of containing the string \"efi\" and of that line, only the 6th column, so the output is:\ndisk0s1\n\nYou already did this part it looks like your EFI disk is disk0s1\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/efi\nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/efi\nsudo rm -rfP /Volumes/efi/EFI/refind\n\nsudo bless --setBoot --mount /\n\n", "Q: Upgrade or replace early 2008 Mac Pro? I have an early 2008 Mac Pro that I use for research involving a lot of statistical computing. Some of this requires a decent amount of memory (storing hundreds of thousands of iterations of simulations, each having many parameter values…). It's fairly slow and seems to be swapping a ton on many of these runs. \nMy question is how easy and how cheap would it be to add memory and maybe a SSD to speed it up (I don't care about processing speed on its own that much). I don't want to invest a ton of money in a machine that might soon be obsolete (e.g. not supported by new OS versions), but I don't have a ton of money to blow on a completely new machine.\nWhat about other options for a new Mac? Would a new iMac with lots of memory be comparable in cost to the total upgrade price for my current machine? I'm not super tech savvy so don't have a good sense for whether throwing many hundreds of dollars into a 7 year old computer is dumb. Advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Based on personal experience, the 08 Mac Pro is well worth squeezing that last bit of life out of.\nIt will take 64GB RAM, as 8 x 16 - even though Apple say it will only take 8GB sticks. Best source, other than OWC [which I think is US only] is eBay. There are specialists who sell old Mac parts & RAM; & mostly list with specific models items will run on. DDR2 is not cheap, though. I think I paid 300 quid for 16GB last year.\nIt's possible to add an SSD in one of the optical bays - without losing any existing drives in the main bays.\nYou will need a 2.5\" > 5.25\" mounting bracket, a PATA > SATA power cable & an SATA data cable [straight ends] maybe 9\" long [don't get the shortest one, it won't reach]\nThe power you get from the optical bay itself.\nThe SATA connection comes from 2 'hidden' extra connectors - on the motherboard, behind the main fan assembly, which you can route behind the optical bay as you refit it.\nClone your existing boot drive with something like Carbon Copy Cloner & away you go.\nThe speed increase from the SSD alone is astonishing.\n\nA: I've asked myself this question numerous times but keep coming back to the idea that the MacPro3,1 (a.k.a. 2008) still has a bit of life left in it.\nWhat is good:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install 32GB of RAM in this thing for approximately $400 (price is average between two options on Amazon and assumes replacing all memory slots).\n\n*You can replace the GPU with something far more modern in comparison to an iMac or \"trash can\" Mac Pro. I currently have a Radeon HD 6870 installed (PC BIOS, I didn't flash it) and has worked great. You only need to worry about the power connectors. Was an upgrade from the original 8800GT for ~$140 eBay over a year ago.\n\n*The performance of 8 cores makes it still somewhat competitive with hardware from as late as 2013.\n\n*SSD is a cheap way to make it feel like a new machine. Guides are available online on how to homebrew a Fusion drive as well.\n\n*Still supported by OS X, though you might have to replace WiFi/Bluetooth hardware to get the latest features like handoff/continuity (~$40-80).\n\n*In comparison to reports from friends, appears to be more stable than the '09 and '10 models (YMMV).\n\n\nWhat is Bad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uses the older 'front side bus' technology Intel chips; access to RAM is much slower than the '09 and later which use the Core i7-class bus.\n\n*Single core performance is much slower than anything made in the last 5 years, even (for the most part) at the low end.\n\n*Only SATA II. As such, your SSD will max out at around 250-300MB/sec instead of SATA III's ~600MB/sec. However, you can work around this with a few hardware dollars.\n\n*Boot camp only officially provides drivers up to Windows 7. Perhaps Windows 8/8.1/10 will work, but I haven't tried it.\n\n*Given it is 7+ years old now, it is a matter of time before it is no longer supported by OSX.\n\n\nThe biggest problem I have is that OSX might stop supporting it soon. But from the technical side, it has 64-bit EFI which is a critical cut-off point for anything past OSX 10.7 Lion. The only reason I could see OSX no longer working on it is because it is no longer compiled for the older Core 2 Duo technology, however, Apple was selling that tech up until early 2012. As such, I would assume support until at least 2016/2017 to give those devices 4-5 years before obsolesence.\nSo if we assume that OSX 10.11 comes out in late 2015, it would most likely support those early 2012 sold products. As such, Apple will most likely support the release of OSX for 2-3 years before going end-of-life. Assuming 10.10 is the last, you're safe with patches until late 2017 or some time in 2018. If 10.11 supports it, add another year to that. For Apple, supporting an OS X product for 10 years isn't too shabby.\nUPDATE: With 10.11 \"El Capitan\" being announced yesterday with support for the MacPro3,1 I'm guessing it is safe to say that your machine will continue to receive updates through at least 2018.\n\nA: A MacPro can hold a lot of RAM and in addition to the 4 HD bays and two Optical drive bays (that can be used with hard drives) there are two more SATA ports on the motherboard that are accessible with a bit of elbow grease.\nRAM is fairly cheap these days and unless you need terabytes of storage SSDs are not that expensive either.\nAn SSD will give you a noticeable speed increase in daily operations that are disk bound (startup, launching applications, reading/writing to disk, etc.) and is what I usually recommend when people want to put some snap back in their Mac, and with that Mac you have lots of places to add a drive.\nNew RAM (depending on how much) and an SSD would be an order of magnitude cheaper than a new faster Mac. And beware as expansion options on the Mac Mini are non-existent and slim on an iMac. The new MacPro is reasonably expandable with RAM, but it is not an inexpensive unit and if you don't need the speed I would stick with the MacPro you have.\n", "Q: NTFS support for Mac I am long time windows user with who just started using Mac. All my external drives(1 & 2tb 2.5 portable drive ) are formatted in NTFS. But I found that my mac cannot read or write on that. So, where are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I make my mac read/write the files in an NTFS partition?\n\n*I have a new 1tb 2.5 drive that I bought to use as time machine. What is the best format for that?\n\n\nFYI: I am using a 10.10.3 Macbook Pro Retina 13\" Late 2013\n\nA: You want to use NTFS for Mac. I had to use this a few months ago to access an external drive (from a Windows user) that I had to work with.\nFor the hard drive that will be used for your Time Machine, that needs to be Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\nA: Just want to provide some information before giving my recommendation -\nWindows and Mac OS use different file systems (NTFS / HFS+) to store files. Therefore, Windows does not support HFS and Mac only partially supports NTFS (can only read, but not write). Therefore, having the drives formatted with NTFS is probably the way to go here, as you at least gain read support from Mac OS by default.\nThere is no official reason as to why this is the case, but the common assumption is that Mac OS doesn't support NTFS because it's not open sourced, so Apple can't officially implement it without licensing the technology.\nSo to the question - what can you do? You can use third party software to install a driver that enables writing to NTFS external drives. There are a few of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mirvago NTFS Mac Mounter\n\n*Paragon NTFS\n\n*Tuxera NTFS (I'm a new user so can't post more than 2 links - google it if you choose it)\n\n\nAll three are used by large enterprise companies and also for personal use, so you can be safe to assume they are great products.\nThere are also some free ones such as Mounty, but I wouldn't recommend them as they rely on the default hidden feature of Mac OS that allows to write NTFS, but this feature is in beta mode, which can cause corruptions and data loss.\n\nA: You'll need to have ntfs-3g driver and FUSE for macOS which extends the file handling capabilities of the OS. Both these things are open source.\nI am not explaining the downloading and installation instructions here because the link below has explained each and everything on how to make NTFS drive work with macOS.

I replaced it, and before applying adhesive, I checked to see it work. It worked fine, it was responsive, etc. But I couldn't close the case because the digitizer extended to the top part of the screen, and needed to be put into place. While doing that, the screen attachment came off -- while the screen was still on, and it went pitch black. Now it does not respond to anything. It's not recognized by the computer and iTunes either. What could have happened? Could it be fixed after this point?\nEdit: connecting to power does not turn it on either.\n\nA: The technical term you are looking for is \"it's busted\"\nIf I read the sequence correctly, you disconnected a major component while the device was operating and now it is unresponsive. Some electronic components can be disconnected without damage, others don't like it and express their displeasure by declining to work again.\nBare minimum, you will need another, known-working screen to see if the screen or the main board is damaged. The cracked screen is fine, IF it was actually working before replacement (cracked glass is fine, cracked glass + no display is not fine). Repair centers keep various components handy for exactly this reason.\nif the known-good screen doesn't work, then you have fried the logic board.

There is a Terminal app called textutil and it allows to convert richtext to plane text.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit and save your 'Rich' text anyway you want to (like in TextEdit).\n\n*Use the commandline textutil to convert your rich text to normal text\ntextutil richtext.rtf -convert txt\n\n\n*You can also pipe the textutil output through sed to replace smartquotes and do whatever your want with it\ntextutil richtext.rtf -convert txt -stdout | sed s/[”“]/'\"'/g\n\n\nBecomes:\nHello, this is rich Text with \"smart\" quotes\n\nA: TextEdit\nYou mention that Apple lost its mind with TextEdit. In what way specifically? Anyway, I would suggest TextEdit:\n\n\n*\n\n*It can open any .txt file as plain text\n\n*It works out of the box\n\n*It allows users to use the mouse\n\n\nYou can list your current preferences programatically like:\ndefaults read com.apple.TextEdit\n\nYou can always set the preferences programatically like this:\ndefaults write com.apple.TextEdit RichText 0\n\n\nKeep in mind that your system settings for quotes can sometimes interfere with the smart quotes settings in TextEdit.

Of course, this is because Terminal itself provides this option. Simply Option+Click where you need it to go. This was previously an option you had to enable in the Terminal Preferences, but for the last few OS X versions, is enabled by default (or hardcoded). It will work in most command line programs, including other editors like vim or emacs.\nAnother option that's enable by default is Scroll Alternative Screen. It lets interactive screens like man or nano be scrolled instead of scrolling the terminal screen. This works with scrolling from a touchpad or a scroll wheel or a magic mouse wheel as well.\n", "Q: Can I create a newspaper type document with photos and words and save directly on my iPad?

I had some water damage on my computer few month ago. After it dried completely computer worked only when I unplugged the battery but if I unplugged the charger my computer was resetting itself (date and time were resetting, it took much longer to load)meaning that it had to be always charged in order to work. So I decided to buy new battery. After I inserted it the magsafe charger didnt work but the battery did (it was on the 50%). I tried also with two other chargers with no success. So computer was working just until my battery didn't drained completely. I did SMC reset wich didn't help. After I unplugged the battery computer worked again. What do you think is causing the problem? Can I do something to repair it? Is it wise to buy another new battery? Could it be a problem with a magsafe board or with a logic board? Can I replace these parts by myself and what are the costs?\nThank you for your help, \nGreets\n\nA: I'm summarizing your points, for my own reference and in case I misunderstood a point. Please point out any errors in my interpretation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Water damage, computer only works when unplugged battery\n\n*But unplug charger, computer resets date and time, longer load\n\n*Thus, always needed 100% charge\n\n*Bought a new battery\n\n*But with this, the charger no longer works, battery does\n\n*Tried two other chargers, no joy\n\n*And with the battery, could use computer until battery drained completely\n\n\nOkay, with that summarized, I would suggest that there were two-or-more connectors (i.e., problems) that developed oxide as a result of the water damage.\nOne problem was related to the original battery, which you disconnected.\nSecond problem was revealed when installing a new battery, which revealed there was still an issue that was not specifically the battery. And you've confirmed that this issue isn't caused by the charger.\nFor your reference, here's a Teardown of Apple's Magsafe connector, in case of use to you.\nI can see that you like to work with electronics, so I won't discourage you from doing repairs because you know the risks. However, if you ultimately send the unit in for repairs, then know that the technician will recognize the unit as a problem because \"someone\" had a go at repairs (i.e., potential problems introduced).\nGood luck.\n", "Q: How can I take selfie by running a console command on Mac? I know I can take a selfie with the built-in camera via the Photo Booth app. However, is there a way capture an image via command line, in sort of lolcommits style?\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is a program called \"ImageSnap\".

For example:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop will save screenshots to your Desktop.\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Documents will save screenshots to your Documents folder.\nOnce you've told it a new location you need to run the following command for OSX to pick up the change.\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nA: Run disk utility and select your hard drive, then repair permissions.\nWhile you can do this with apps running it would probably run more smoothly and quickly if you quit out of all open apps before doing this.\nIf repair permissions fails for whatever reason start the Mac in recovery mode (COMMAND-R upon reboot) and then go into disk utility and repair the disk and then permissions.\nIf it still fails it may be time for a 3rd-party disk repair utility.\n\nA: Another case where this error will occur is if the connection to a network-based home folder is broken. A bunch of other trouble will occur simultaneously, but if you try to take a screen shot of that trouble, you'll get this error message. (From first-hand experience)\nDoubt that this is the answer to the original question; but it's probably worth noting nonetheless. \n\nA: Make a new user and see if the problem is due to errors on your account would be my first step. \nOnce you know it's a system problem or a user problem you can proceed as the fix is different for both. I would start a new thread with this detail added since there are going to be two cases to solve for the general situation causing this error.\nYou could also use the Grab app to save the screen shot to a place you do have permissions and avoid the system screen shot problem entirely.\n\nA: Go to the location, right click and select Get Info, then uncheck \"Locked\"\n", "Q: How do I mirror my hard drive? How do I mirror my hard drive?  I want to preserve programs for which I've lost the license number.\n\nA: Generally speaking to \"mirror\" a hard drive often means setting up a RAID where one drive mirrors the other. This is done using either the RAID software built into Disk Utility or 3rd party RAID software.\nThe benefits of that is that each drive is a duplicate of the other and if one fails the other disk has all your valuable data. The \"problem\" is that you generally cant set up RAID across a USB or Thunderbolt bus (that I am aware of). So if you have a Mac with one internal drive you can't set up a RAID between the internal and an external drive.\nYou can also use a utility like SuperDuper, Carbon Copy Cloner (and others) to make a bootable duplicate of your HD, essentially making a mirror copy of the drive, just not done in real time like a RAID mirror would.\nBoth of those applications can be scheduled to run on a regular basis (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.) and copy only the changed files to the backup drive.\nI use SuperDuper to do just this and it is scheduled to run every other day automatically. It connects to another Mac that is always on, mounts a disk image and backs up the changed files.\n\nA: I think what you really want to do is to create a bootable backup of your hard drive.  There are several good utilities for this (ChronoSync is my favorite).  The benefit of a bootable backup is that not only can you restore files from it, but you can also directly boot from it if the hard drive in your computer should ever fail.\n", "Q: Applescript to hide print queue Running a Processing sketch which saves .txt files to a folder. Have a folder action attached that prints new files in this folder to a thermal receipt printer. \nHowever, I had to update to Yosemite, and since then the print queue window opens up over the sketch and has to be closed manually before continuing with the sketch.\nWhen I print a document normally the printer proxy behaves and stays in the dock, and doesn't change focus from Processing.\nI have no Applescript experience, but I think I need a script that I could include in the folder action, so these .txt files print automatically, without intervention while Processing is running.\n\nA: One idea that comes to mind is to use the command line tools to print the files. If the files are sent to the printer without any pre-processing - in other words raw - then the following command should do it...\nlp  somefile.txt - if your printer is the default\nor\nlp -d MyPrinter somefile.txt - for non-default printer\nUse lpstat -a to get a list of printers and their Unix names.\nFrom applescript you would have to do it this way...\nset pFile to POSIX path of txtFile\ndo shell script \"lp \" & quoted form of pFile\n\n", "Q: Will using the iphone camera flash as a flashlight for long periods harm it in any way? We have an old iPhone 4 that we use as a music machine in a spare room.  Will using the flash as a nightlight overnight cause any damage? \nMy guess is no, but a part of me (maybe thinking of old camera flashes) thinks I should ask first.\nThanks.\n\nA: I would say no for two reasons,\n\n\n*\n\n*The flash on an iPhone is an LED which unlike old camera flashes doesn't mind running for extended periods of time.\n\n*Flashlight use isn't limited by iOS. If the letting the flash run for a while would break the phone apple wouldn't allow you to do so or at the very least set a timer to turn it off after so long.\nThe only problem T could see is the bulb will eventually burn out, but considering you don't seem to need the camera anyway that probably isn't an issue for you.  \n\nA: Yes the lightbulb wires in a 4 have been know to short this has happened in my grandfathers phone but it took 3 years so it shouldn't be a big issue\n\nA: Ya led bulb should last years in theory. but they do fail sometimes. especially when left in hot environment (closed up car) \n", "Q: How to periodically show alert message *in foreground*?

Being a Linux user I know you can use RAID to expand storage with 2 disk, so storage looks like 1 HD. However, most of the time this setup happens when NO O/S is currently installed on 1 of the 2 storage units.\nWould is be possible to expand my storage from the current internal flash storage that host the O/S to a SDXC card, so the storage virtually looks like 1 hard-drive from the mac os desktop?\nThis should be resolved software wise, however I do not think Disk Utility can accomplish or this can be naturally accomplish with out erasing the OS 1st(Which I do not want to do).\n\nA: The only viable options for RAID using just 2 drives would be RAID 0 or 1. \nRAID 1 wouldn't increase your storage, so 0 is the only remaining choice. \nEven if you could RAID an internal fixed drive to a removable SD card (& without first formatting both), the drive would only be 'whole' so long as both were present (& still functional.)\nIf either drive was missing (or broken) the entire RAID would be irrecoverable.\nTrusting an entire RAID to the vagaries of an SD card would be playing russian roulette with your data.\n", "Q: Disable ⌘+SHIFT+F keyboard shortcut for fullscren I use Spectacle to allow me to hit ⇧ + ⌥ + ⌘ + F to maximize a window.

It's my first time Mac ever so I'm confused. I know its kinda of portability choice between the 2 models but It's not an issue with me as I'm not travelling a lot nor develop outside home. So my main concern would be the possibility of coding as well as option to make me comfortable with coding. (screen size factor, Retina display, ...etc).\nAny advice would be much appreciated!\n\nA: I find that the flexibility of being able to move around in the house makes it worth getting a laptop. Mobile freedom is really addictive once you get used to it. The only issue is that, for coding, having a ton of screen real-estate is advantageous. Obviously the iMac has the MacBook Pro beat in that regard, but you could get a cheap external display for that purpose. It depends on which setup you'd find yourself most comfortable with. Sometimes, if I'm just writing a Python script with no UI, I can easily do it with one monitor, and so then the mobile freedom offered to me by my laptop is incredibly nice. The other times, I have a cheap external monitor for my UI, and my MacBook Pro's monitor for the code, since it has such a high res display to make all the text crystal clear. The UI monitor doesn't have to be terribly high-res, just large. It works well for me.\n\nA: Let me suggest you the Macbook Pro and let me explain why.\nFor me the most important thing developing with xcode is the screen resolution. You usually have two or more xcode panels open, so, more resolution means more space and let you be more agile and productive. Plus, if you use the simulator to test programs, you will want to have it in the same screen.\nSaid that, the 21\" iMac have less screen resolution than the Macbook Pro. So, if I were you I will go for the MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: Can I install figlet from the terminal? I really love FIGlet, and use it frequently in my code and emails.

You can then arrange these two windows of the same document (views of the same window, if you like) as you wish.\nI think that's the best you're going to get natively without some additional software.\n\nA: Long press the fullscreen button, and then you will figure out the rest.\n", "Q: If the Apple Watch has wifi - does it connect to my local router?

Does anyone have any experience creating a multi-partition USB Stick with bootable partitions for installing Mavericks, Yosemite and Snow Leopard? \nI have a 32Gb stick I'd be perfectly willing to devote to this venture - if such a thing is even possible to create.\nI have experience creating a singular Mavericks installer USB Stick - but does Option-booting a Mac allow for booting from multiple partitions?\n\nA: Okay.. Apple have a perfectly workable website titled \"Create a bootable installer for OS X\" ( https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372 )\nWhich tells you what to do via the Terminal, once you have successfully downloaded Install OS X El Capitan.app, Install OS X Yosemite.app and Install OS X Mavericks.app.\nTheir instructions are as follows:\nEDIT: note, added macOS Sierra, which works with the same method - but is not listed on their website\nmacOS Sierra\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\n\nOS X El Capitan\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\nOS X Yosemite\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app\n\nOS X Mavericks\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app\n\nI was able to use these commands from the Terminal, onto a Disk Utility -made 5 partition USB stick. I verified it with option-down-during-boot (alt-down-during-boot) and both of them booted up fine.\nI was unable to find an OS X Snow Leopard installer from my hard drive or elsewhere, so I'm considering this question answered.\nNote: Mountain Lion installer app does not have \"createinstallmedia\" like Yosemite+Mavericks do, hence I didn't install that one on a USB stick - for that, one would have to use a secondary set of instructions for installing the installer to a USB stick via the usual way (Disk Utility, mounting, copying, copying some more..)\n\nA: While I do not have experience with this particular method O/S X can easily boot from multi partitions on any media. It does to matter if it is a USB key, a Thunderbolt RAID array or whatever. Holding down the option key will give you all bootable partitions available to the Mac at boot.\n\nA: Yes - it is possible. I have a USB drive with bootable OS X versions from 10.6 to 10.10.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use disk utility to create the partitions you need. Under Partition you can choose the number of desired partitions. Make sure you select the GUID Partition Table (GPT) in Options.\n\n*Use a tool like DiskMaker X to create the OS X drives for you. For OS X 10.9 and 10.10 can also use the method described by @esaruoho.\n\n*Press alt during boot and select the partition you want. \n\n\nNB: Your Mac will only boot the partitions that it can actually handle.

If you are using El Capitan (OS X 10.11), then you would be better of installing rEFInd in a EFI partition.\n\nIn your example, the command would be as shown below.\n./install.sh  --alldrivers  --ownhfs  /dev/disk0s5.\n\nI assume disk0s5 has been formatted \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\". I don't think I would use a 17.1 GB partition. The rEFInd partition on my Mac is 134 MB in size.\nIf you need to write to disk0s5 while booted to Ubuntu, you may have to disable journaling. This usually happens when you need to modify refind.conf.\nTo turn journaling off, do the following using the Disk Utility application.\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the partition.\n\n*Press and hold the \"alt/option\" key.\n\n*From the menu bar select \"File->Disable Journaling\"\n\n*Release the \"alt/option\" key.\n\n*You may have to quit and reopen the Disk Utility to see the change.\n\n\nTo turn journaling on, you need to highlight the partition and click on the \"Enable Journaling\" button. To see the change, you may have to quit and reopen the Disk Utility application. \n", "Q: How can I iPhone restore in iTunes without upgrading iOS? I am trying to restore a set of my iPhone5C backups I made in iTunes to my iPhone4S. My iPhone4S is still running on iOS 7.0.4. I don't want to upgrade it because iOS8 on iPhone4S will almost be unusable (the current iOS7 is bad enough on iPhone4S).\nI have tried doing this directly in iTunes using its restore function, but when I do so, iTunes forces me to update my iOS to 8.3. If I refuse to upgrade, the restore function will abort and I cannot continue with my restore from there. \nHow can I perform the restore in iTunes without having to upgrade my iOS?\n\nA: You can't.\nRestoring from another device's backup will update to the latest iOS the restored device can use.\nThe only way would be to restore from a backup initially made from that same device, using that iOS.\n", "Q: Do you still need iPhone when running with Apple Watch? Are you able to use the Apple Watch when running or jogging without taking the iPhone out? The iPhone is bulky and I don't like running with it.\n\nA: You are able to use the Apple Watch when running without taking your iPhone with you. The caveat to do doing so is that you won't have access to any online services but the included fitness apps will work just fine!\nThis article at MacWorld has actually summarised exactly what you can and cannot do when your watch isn't connected to your phone. The paragraph that might be of most interest to you is:\n\nIf you want to go for a run without having to tote a bulky phone, the Apple Watch’s exercise capabilities are pretty much self-sufficient. All of the watch’s onboard sensors, such as the accelerometer and the heart rate monitor, keep on trucking even when your phone’s not around. Just fire up the Workout app, pick your exercise type and goal, and leave the iPhone at home.\n\nReferences:\nWhat can your Apple Watch do without your iPhone? | MacWorld\n", "Q: Mistakenly removed permissions I have a severe permissions' issue. I hope there are some really clever people out there, who might know how to solve this using the Terminal, expert-level hacking or in some really simple way so I at least can backup my data despite the faulty permissions.\nThis is the cause of the issue\nBeing a curious person, in Finder I right-clicked my User and hard-drive unit and removed \"staff\" as well as changed permissions for \"everyone\" under permissions. After this my Mac (Macbook Pro, 13 \", early 2013, latest version of Yosemite) hung and every time I try to start it up, it gets stuck loading before the login screen.\nThis is what I have tried and all have failed\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting the faulty computer and letting it be to see if it would finish loading.\n\n*Rebooting it with cmd+r, entering disk utility, repairing permissions. This outputs\nUser differs on private/var/db/displaypolicyd; should be 0; user is 244.\nGroup differs on private/var/db/displaypolicyd; should be 0; user is 244.\nRepaired \"private/var/db/displaypolicyd\"\n\nHowever, when I reboot the permissions' issue remain and when entering Disk Utility again, I get the same permissions' repair messages.\n\n*Rebooting it and creating a new ACL.\n\n*Using another Macbook Pro, mounting the faulty one with the help of rebooting it in Target Mode. However, the permissions' issue doesn't permit me to access the drive this way. In Disk Utility, I can select the drive with the faulty permissions, but I can't select the option repair permissions.\n\n*Using another Macbook Pro, mounting the faulty one with the help of rebooting it in Target Mode and creating a new image (dmg) of its hard-drive to the functional computer.\n\n*Looked at the answers in How Should I Correct the Owners and Permissions in an OS X User Folder?, but they don't help in solving my problem\nThis I need help with\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I repair the permissions considering this specific case and what has been tried already?\n\n*Or (if there is no easy way out of this) is it possible to make a backup of the drive so I can reinstall everything without loosing data?\n\n\nA: To get started, you need at least to re-install the OS. Boot into the recovery system by pressing Cmd-R on system startup and the proceed with installing the OS. This will (unless something goes very wrong) not impact your existing data\nAfter that, you will at least have a system which boots again. What still needs to be done (and which may turn out to be a rather cumbersome process) is to fix permissions for all non-standard applications and their support/library files. Again, just reinstalling these applications might be the easiest way.\n", "Q: iPhone 5s goes to airplane mode by itself How does my iPhone 5s get to airplane mode if I do not go into Settings and change it manually to airplane mode?\n\nA: You can use the control center!\n", "Q: Youtube full screen doesn't work properly on yosemite Since my macbook is a 13\" model, I like to use my entire screen when watching YouTube. But a problem has started.\n\n\n*\n\n*When my Firefox isn't in full screen, and I click the full screen button of my video, Firefox goes to full screen mode (opens a new desktop and goes to full screen) and then shows the video in full screen. \n\n*When my Firefox is already full screen, the video just opens in full screen as it should, but once I close the video, Firefox also goes out of full screen.\nSo I can't keep my Firefox in full screen if I want to watch videos in full screen. I can't keep it windowed if I want to watch full screen.\nAlso the constant going in and out of full screen of Firefox is insanely annoying since it takes a few moments for the animation to complete.\nAnyone out there that has the same issues?\n\nA: Just to confirm your observation on current version 38.01 of Firefox.\nThere are 2 types of full screen mode.\nOne is the Firefox it self in full screen mode. It will stay like that till you turn it off.\nIt does not look the same as the Video full screen. You can still see the Tabs. It is not correct that it will open the videos in full screen automatically, you still have to do that on the video it self.\nThe second mode is the Video full screen mode. It is controlled by the video player. In this mode the video takes truly the full screen and you do not see the tabs any more.\nIn full screen \"video mode\" all browser functions are disabled (not visible) thus you can not browse anyway.\nGranted in your situation:\nFirefox full screen -> Video full screen, when exiting video full screen also the Firefox it self will exit the full screen is what Firefox does currently.\nThat is (was) a known bug in Firefox.\nOne way it works better is to choose the Video player for YouTube. \nSwitch from the HTML5 player to the Flash Player.\n", "Q: Can you see old messages on a SIM card free phone? Can you still see old messages on an old SIM card for an iPhone 4? Mine died a few months ago, AT&T techs took out the SIM card when they gave me my new phone, but now my parents are trying to \"fix\" my old phone to be nosy! Yikes!\n\nA: Assuming you didn't wipe your phone before removing the SIM card, your messages (and everything else) will still be on the phone. If your phone is still registered in \"Find my iPhone\" and has network connectivity (either through a new SIM card or through WiFi), you can wipe it from your iCloud account. See iCloud: Find My iPhone overview and iCloud: Erase your device for details about the procedure.\n", "Q: Pros and cons of wiping a new Mac? Coming from the PC world, most made-to-order manufacturers (e.g., Dell, HP, Acer, etc.) all have annoying little addons which I consider spyware/bloatware--things like toolbars with ads. When buying such PC laptops, I would always reformat their hard drives and then install just Windows (and drivers), ensuring a blank slate without any bloat.\nI don't believe Apple includes such spyware/bloatware. Nevertheless, when purchasing a new machine direct from Apple, are there are any advantages or disadvantages to wiping the existing drive and performing a fresh install of OS X?\n\nA: There isn't any advantage to wiping and reinstalling OS X on a new Mac direct from Apple.  You'll end up with the exact same drive contents.  I can't think of any difference between an Apple-imaged Mac and a self-imaged Mac.\n\nA: No, Apple doesn't have any bloatware. But I still see two advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Free up some space (precious if you have 128 GB SSD) if you won't be using iLife apps such GarageBand or use Office instead of iWork apps. They can consume a few gigabytes. And you will be still able install them later as when you first run Mac App Store, it will run a check of your serial number to see if you're eligible to download it for free.\n\n*Consider splitting Fusion Drive to two drives - fast SSD for system, apps and home folder, and large HD for other, more space consuming media such as videos. Of course out-of-box FD is working well but geeks like us might want to be more in control of what's happening with our data.\n\n\nApple Diagnostics can be loaded from Internet with option-D. This lists the disk images which are loaded.\nJust a warning - some apps such as Adobe won't work with case-sensitive format.\n\nA: There are several disadvantages: \n\n\n*\n\n*Most internet posts describing how to reinstall OS X miss the hardware specific diagnostic boot image that is stored on Recovery HD (this has changed starting with El Capitan 10.11).\n\n*You will lose the iLife apps if you don't first boot the factory OS and claim those redemptions to an Apple ID.\n\n\nThe recovery boot isn't a deal breaker if you don't mind using a generic internet recovery boot image when needed. Or you can find and reinstall the following folder on the 'Recovery HD': /com.apple.recovery.boot/.diagnostics \nSo, your call on what happens when pressing and holding the 'D' button at startup.\nLosing iMovie, Photos (or iPhotos if the Mac shipped with that as well/instead), GarageBand doesn't matter if you purchased the hardware under a DEP program or don't care to use those or already have them or don't care to spend money later to buy them as needed.\n\nA: Wiping the disk could disable the software necessary to implement FileVault 2, Apple's method of full disk encryption.\n", "Q: Brew Install Rtorrent not Working I am unable to brew build rtorrent.

I plan to use my Apple Watch Sport predominately for tracking fitness goals. I am curious if turning the watch to the inside of my wrist will affect its performance when measuring my heart rate. (I like to use kettlebells, so I will surely smash the screen if I keep the watch on the outside of my wrist.)\n\nA: Today I wore my Apple Watch on the inside of my wrist while weight lifting. I tightened it one additional notch compared to how I normally wear it during daily activities. Otherwise I had noticed that it would often lose my heart rate, even on the top of my wrist. This usually happened when my arms were vertical and/or the particular exercise required me to twist my wrists.\nI am happy to report my heart rate was detected without skipping a beat. The main downside is Activate On Wrist Raise is very finicky. I suppose that is to be expected since the Watch assumes it's being worn on the top of your wrist.\nPossibly-relevant piece of information: I am Vietnamese with fairly light skin on the inside of my wrist. Your mileage may vary if you have darker skin.\nAlso note that I'm only verifying the proper function of the heart rate monitor. I haven't tested distance or step count estimates while wearing the device this way, although I don't see why that should affect those functions.\nEdit: I tried again the following day and the Watch lost my pulse on occasion, on either side of my wrist, even when tightened as much as possible. I slid the Watch up my wrist a little and my pulse was detected correctly again. I think this is because when the Watch is too low, movements of your hand tug on the skin and make it harder to measure your blood flow.\n\nA: I am doing kettlebells as well and rotate it on the inside of my wrist, but I use a bluetooth heart rate monitor, you can get them for like 50 bucks, its probably worth it.\n", "Q: OSX Yosemite uses over 500mb daily, without me using it.

Maybe it has logs with timestamps so you could see if any other device used it or what else happened! \nBecause you said that the Internet is expensive, it could be that someone else is using it. \nI assume you have the WiFi secured and it is not public?

It's not stable and I'd highly recommend using a third party utility.  I use the paid version of Tuxera NTFS for Mac and enable/disable as needed.

What happens if JAVA_HOME is pointing to JDK 1.8 and /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK points to jdk 1.6. \nDoes this mean when we change JAVA_HOME, we must change /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK too?\n\n*\n\n*There is another folder called /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/ which is a shortcut to /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A. Now, i read in some post that\n\nThe java executables in >/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java are >not the executables that just run the java compiler etc. They are wrappers that >use /usr/libexec/java_home to find the executables.\n  \n  I am assuming if programs get the latest java from /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/ and if /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/ uses /usr/libexec/java_home to find the executables then it would end up using jdk 1.8 in my case. Is this assumption correct?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*So, there seem to be 4 variable's here,, where $JAVA_HOME is pointing to, where /usr/libexec/java_home takes you,, where does /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK point to and finally where does /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current point to. Would be great if someone could comment on the correct way to setup JAVA_HOME so that all app's, terminal windows etc use the same JVM version.\n\n\nA: The only one that matters if running via /usr/bin/java is the value of JAVA_HOME and can be set for all terminals etc e.g. to get latest 1.7 add to your startup shell script (e.g. ~/.bashrc)\nexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v '1.7*'\n\nUnfortunately apps (ie GUI installed as OS X Application bundles e.g. Eclipse) access the java that is set up in their package information (Which can be a fullpath to one in /Library or /System/Library or could be /usr/bin/java) so they need to be looked at at a case by case basis.\nThe difference between installing a JDK in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines vs /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/ is that the latter is installed by Apple as part of the OS and the other is by a third party\nThe CurrentJDK is the way Apple versions OS X frameworks - in Java's case I don't think it matters now (in pre 1.7 days it might have been how the old Java preference tab worked but that is a guess)\n", "Q: The screen problem Hardware specs: MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012); 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 processor;\n                4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3; Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB\nSoftware specs: Mac OS-X yosemite 10.10.3;\nSome part of my screen blinks and looks like that laptop is hanged but actually its only screen problem.

I tried installing Karabiner keymap tool hoping to disable some keys but it still triggers some of the weird behaviour the keys mysteriously adapted so I uninstalled it.\nThe problem did go away two days ago (I have no idea how. I was just doing work research and the keys started working normally) but unfortunately, after turning it back on today for another day of work, the problem came back.\nAny ideas on what I can do to fix this? \nIs it most likely a hardware or a software problem?\n\nA: First, boot into single user mode/verbose mode. If the problem persists, its hardware.\nThe hardware problem can be as simple as a loose connector between keyboard and logic board. I had experience with a malfunctioning trackpad on my no-retina MBP 13'. The cause was that the connector came loose and only some lines of signals were fed into the system. I don't see how the connector would come loose without external cause; I opened up/modded my MBP many many times. However, I can say that there is free space between the connector and the bottom chassis of the laptop, enough for it to become loose.\nI know retina-ones are different from my MBP in config, so you should look up ifixit to see if that's the case for you. Plus, you might have warranty concerns etc that stop you from opening up the machine.\n", "Q: How to export photos from the new Photos app in full quality? I noticed that the new Photos.app reduces image size on export. If I drag & drop a photo from the Photos library, the size is reduced by at least 50%.\nHow do I get rid of this behavior and recover my original photo file?\n\nA: File > Export > Export Unmodified Original...\n\nwill export a full size image to the folder of your choice.\n\nA: I found the original in:\n~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/\n\nI still need to find a way to tweak the awful default behavior...\n\nA: The title of your question asks how to export photos in full quality, whereas your last sentence asks how to recover your original photo. @JaimeSantaCruz is absolutely correct that you can Export Unmodified Original, which will give you a full-quality copy of your original. However, if you've made edits to the photo, they will be lost with that command.\nWhat I would suggest is using the standard Export command instead (⇧ shift ⌘ cmd E).\n\nIf you expand the Photos section by clicking the ∨ button you will be given the choice of several parameters for your export.\n\nMake sure you pick Full Size as the Size.\nFor JPEG Quality, I recommend High for photos taken with an iPhone or iPad, as I believe this is the quality setting used by iOS to save photos.\nAs a test, I emailed an iPhone photo to myself as Actual Size, from my iPhone then from macOS Photos (using the Share action), and also exported it using Unmodified Original, High and Maximum.\nUnmodified Original, High and email as Actual Size from both iPhone and macOS all came out to the same size (although emailing from macOS occasionally produced a slightly larger file). On the other hand, Maximum produced a file almost three times as large, with no perceivable difference in quality when blown up on a 27” non-Retina iMac.\nTherefore, I would only use Maximum for images imported manually, known to use a lesser compression (higher quality) originally.\nNote that when you Export an edited photo, Photos re-encodes that photo (necessary to apply the changes). That is why the size of the exported photo won’t match the original. Using Export with High quality on an unmodified photo should produce the same photo as Unmodified Original.\nPersonally, when I drag an iPhone photo from Photos to my desktop, it is exported with the same size and quality as an Unmodified Original or a photo shared by email as Actual Size. As far as I can tell, this is not a case of Photos simply applying your last-used settings. So I'm not sure why you're seeing different behavior.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that you’ll get to choose compression options when you export videos as well. However the videos appear to be re-encoded regardless of the settings you choose for Export. They do not get re-encoded when you use Export Unmodified Original.\n\nA: As an alternative to the solutions described in the other answers, you may drag-and-drop from Photos to, e.g., the Finder by holding the alt key. Doing so will cause the original to be copied instead of the converted version. This works both for photos and videos.\n\nA: right click and select displayn package content should do enable that. \n", "Q: How to skip OS X VNC connect password requester? I have an Ubuntu server which I tend to use via VNC from OS X. For this, I have saved a .vncloc file from the built-in Screen Sharing client. When I click this icon, Screen Sharing connects to Ubuntu, but shows this requester already filled in:\n\nSince I saved my password in my Keychain, I just have to press enter every time. Is it possible to skip this requester somehow and connect immediately using the saved credentials?\n\nA: The questioner already has a .vncloc file, so the simplest answer is to add the username into that file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the file.  (If you haven't moved it, it'll probably be in ~/Library/Application Support/Screen Sharing/.)\n\n*Ensure you have write permission.  (E.g. with the Finder, or chmod +w.)\n\n*Open it in your favourite text editor (e.g. vim).\n\n*Edit the first line with vnc://<address> to read vnc://<username>@<address>.\n\n*Save it.\nThe file will then connect directly to the remote system, skipping the password dialog entirely.\nYou can run it by double-clicking on the file in the Finder, dragging the file onto the Dock, or using open from the command line.\n(Alternatively, you can include the username in the vnc: address when first creating the file.)\n\nA: Applescript.

Why should someone use one versus the other one? Why should someone use only one of them?\n\nA: iCloud Photo Library uploads every photo on every iDevice to iCloud and syncs then. My Photo Stream only saves the 1,000 most recent photos. Basically, the only advantage of My Photo Stream is that it doesn't count against your iCloud storage, whereas iCloud Photo Library does.\n\nA: You'd still use it if you have devices that do not support iCloud Photo Library.\n", "Q: Securityd process uses 100% CPU when Mail app is open I have a Macbook Air mid 2011 with OS X Yosemite.

These unlink operation are to be done on MBA's side. Here is how I reached this conclusion:\n\n\n*\n\n*securityd handles cryptographic operations on OS X. All processes communicate with securityd through SecurityAgent. That fact that these two are not throwing error in system log means something talking to them is the culprit.\n\n*icbaccountsd has ur email/icloud authorization info stored. To see what I mean, terminal:\n/usr/libexec/icbaccountsd raw\nand you will see your addresses in the printout.\n\n\n*An error in the icbaccountsd doesn't necessarily mean a wrong password. It could also be a incorrect/corrupted public/private key. Or a formating error in the file (hence, the infinite loop).\n\n\nSo you should uncouple your emails from MBA and recouple them later. These are the measures you can take to do that, from safest to more drastic. You can do only one each time, add back your emails, and wait to see if it works. Or you can undertake all at once and add back. Needless to say, before re-adding, restart your laptop.\n\n\n*\n\n*Deactivate all accounts under System Preferences -> iCloud and Internet Accounts. (This is probably too puny to work.)\n\n*Delete those accounts System Preferences -> iCloud and Internet Accounts.\n\n*Open Keychain app and delete any entry related to your email addresses and email servers. These entries can be passwords, keys, certificates, etc.\n\n*open ~/Library/ and back up files in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/ and ~/Library/Mail/. Delete the originals.\nThese would give you a machine free from any association with your emails. You many wonder if you should simply/also purge /usr/libexec/icbaccountsd. I won't recommend it til all else fails. \n", "Q: How to stream only the video to an Apple TV from a Mac? I have an Apple TV with which I'd like to read videos from my mac, both from Internet (Youtube for example) and from files stored on my hard drive.\nThere is two ways of doing it: the first one is Airplay Mirroring, but this does not work well enough, since there is a lag between the sound and the video. The second one is to use the built in option to read only the video, and not to mirror the whole screen.\nI managed to use both of these options with my iPhone/iPad :\n\n\n*\n\n*Airplay Mirroring is done through the control center\n\n*Reading only the video is done with a little icon that appears on the bottom right of the video player, like this one :\nBut on my mac, the icon does not appear when I try to read a video. It is always in the menu bar (top left part of the screen), where it only allows me to to mirror my screen. I would like to read only the video, like I do with my iPad/iPhone, to avoid this sound/picture offset.\nIs there any way to do it? The best would be to find a solution that would work for videos on the Internet and for saved video files.\n\nA: There are two ways to send content via AirPlay from your Mac to your Apple TV when it comes out of the box. The first is the Mirroring method, found, as you mentioned, in the Menu Bar on OS X and in the Control Centre on iOS. As far as the in-app method goes, the only app that supports that is iTunes. There should be an AirPlay icon at the top of the window to send music and movies to your TV.\nThere is some third-party software available for sending content via AirPlay, as well. First of all, I have not personally tried these methods, so keep that in mind. The first is Beamer ($15), which can take video files and send them over to the TV. The second is AirParrot ($15), which allows you to mirror content as usual, but it also allows you to have the TV act as a second monitor or to beam over a single app (so you can send any single app over, like QuickTime or a web browser).\nThen there is the tried-and-trusted option of just taking a video cable and connecting your Mac that way. I don't know what Mac you're using (might not be so feasible with a desktop) but AirPlay has in my experience always had some latency and picture quality drop associated with it (same goes with the Chromecast and other wireless display technologies I've tried in the past) and just using an HDMI cable should give you a speedy, high-quality output. It's the option I'd choose most of the time.\n\nA: QuickTime can stream video only to AppleTV.\n\n\nWith most MP4 files it works well. I had issues with old videos in MP4 (recorded with Nokia from 2007) and some very large files.\n", "Q: Can I compress SMS content to free up storage? My SMS on my iPhone is growing everyday. According to my iPhone's Usage function, I have about 1.2GB of SMS data. My phone has been running on low storage and any megabytes are precious. \nIs there anyway to compress my SMS data or archive them to free up space on my phone? Although I don't refer to my old SMS messages all the time, I would still want to be able to search for them when I need. Perhaps this could be done either on my phone or on a computer or even over the cloud. \nOtherwise, how do you usually manage your SMS data to keep them within reasonable storage space?\n\nA: The app iExplorer can export one, several, or all messages from your iPhone and save them in a number of ways. Once you have exported and archived the conversations onto your Mac or PC, you can delete them from your phone & reclaim space.\n\nThe easiest takes each conversation and exports PDFs out of them with images attached in-line: \n\nOther options let you save images & other attachments in a variety of ways:\n\nLowest price point is US$35, and well worth it.\n[Full Disclosure: I'm just a happy customer who has no financial stake in Macroplant.]\n", "Q: Full screen always enabled when opening app in OS X How can I set my Macbook Air to always open new apps in full screen mode? \nSome apps already do it (Mail for example), but others are always opening as a small window, especially Safari when I close (cmd+W) all the tabs.\nIs there a setting, a terminal command line, or anything to fix this?\n\nA: There's an option called resume I think - check out this post. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4140495?tstart=0.

To start, reboot while holding down the T key on the Mac of which you would like to access the disk. \nOnce booted into Target Disk Mode, connect it to another Mac. This can be done using a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable, or using a USB Type C > USB Type A cable if you have the MacBook (Retina 12\") (note that Apple does not sell this cable, but Belkin will soon. You can use your standard USB Type C cable if you're connecting it to another MacBook). \nThen, to get to your displays preferences, open the property list located at ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver.<uuid>.plist.

I started that partition when Windows 8 was still in Developer preview, and it worked really well for a while, and I upgraded it a few times eventually to 8.1.\nThen the partition wasn't recognized anymore. I think it was after the upgrade to Yosemite (but could have been Mavericks, I don't remember).\nI just this week repartitioned and formatted the computer. Now, I'm on Yosemite, and I have tried a bunch of things to get Windows 10 installed and I can't get it to work.\nI tried these things:\nCreating A Bootable USB Of Windows 8.1 On OS X?\nBootcamp doesn't allow me to install an ISO to a USB (because I'm pre USB), and doesn't support my windows 10 iso that I burned to a DVD (RW), because, according to BootCamp, my computer doesn't support windows 8. This is wrong for two reasons: 1, I used to have windows 8 running smoothly (more smoothly [anecdotally] than yosemite does (but this is a 6+ year old macbook, so what's to be expected?) Also, this is windows 10, why is it complaining that windows 8 isn't supported when I'm trying to do windows 10 (sure, simple mistake, but a mistake nonetheless).\nI've tried various steps involving updating my info.plist file, but after I do that (which requires very specific set of steps to even get updated, bootcamp won't even work. Some sources say that this is because modifying the plist file breaks a signature, and have a seperate command to re-sign, but the re-signing steps are out of date for yosemite, so the command isn't right.\nI've found other resources that recommend using dd to put the windows 10 iso (or a .img converted using hdiutil convert onto a 32 gb usb, but when I do that, while it looks fine in osx, the drive isn't recognized as formatted in any windows machine, and doesn't work to boot.\nAny recommendations?\n\nA: How to install Windows without using the BootCamp Assistant.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and copy the Boot Camp Support Software to a flash drive.\nYou will need this later.\n\n*You need to create a \"MS-DOS (FAT)\" formatted partition. \nOne way would be during a clean install. Use the Disk Utility to\ncreate a two partitions. The  first would be \"Mac OS Extended\n(Journaled)\" for OS X and the second would be \"MS-DOS (FAT)\"\nformatted for Windows. Install OS X to the first partition. I would\navoid using Core Storage.\nThe second way would be to create a single \"Mac OS Extended\n(Journaled)\" partition and install OS X. Again, avoid using Core\nStorage. Once installed, you should be able to use the Disk Utility\nto shrink this partition and add a \"MS-DOS (FAT)\" formatted\npartition for Windows.\n\n*Bless the Windows partition. Using the Disk Utility application,\nhighlight the \"MS-DOS (FAT)\" formatted partition and click the Info\nbutton. Note the Disk Identifier. It usually is disk0s4. To install\nWindows, the last digit can not be greater than 4. In a Terminal\napplication window, enter the following command. \nsudo bless --device /dev/disk0s4 --setBoot --legacy\n\nHere is assumed disk0s4 is the correct Disk Identifier.\n\n*Set the active MBR partition. From a Terminal application window\nenter the following.\nsudo fdisk -e /dev/disk0\nflag 4\nquit\nyes\n\nHere 4 was used because it was the last digit of the Disk\nIdentifier. Below is an example of me entering the above commands.\nSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk0\nPassword:\nfdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory\nEnter 'help' for information\nfdisk: 1> flag 4\nPartition 4 marked active.\nfdisk:*1> quit\nWriting current MBR to disk.\nDevice could not be accessed exclusively.\nA reboot will be needed for changes to take effect. OK? [n] yes\nSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ \n\n\n*Install Windows. Insert the Windows DVD and restart the computer.\nHold down either Option key during restart. Choose the DVD when the\nicons appear. If you have more than one DVD icon, there may be a\nproblem with the DVD. In this case, see the note below.\n\n*After the installation of Windows is complete, insert the flash\ndrive and install the Boot Camp Support Software.\n\n\nThis was done from my memory. If you have a problem, let me know.\nNote: More Than One DVD Icon\nWhen trying to boot to the Window installation, DVD you may get two DVD icons to choose from. They are usually labeled \"Windows\" and \"EFI Boot\". The correct choice is \"Windows\". This may lead to the following message being displayed.\n       1.\n\n       2.\nSelect CD-ROM Boot Type :\n\nI found this to be true using a DVD burned from the  \"Windows10_InsiderPreview_x64_EN-US_10074.iso\". The message has also occurred using certain Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 installation DVD's. The problem is the DVD and not with the steps given in this answer. The solution is to remove the \"EFI Boot\" method from the DVD or iso image. The procedure is given at “Select CD-ROM Boot Type:” error during Windows install.\n\nA: Why so complicated?\nJust start Windows 8.1 and then update via web or when notified for the free copy download, to Windows 10.\nForget and ignore the Boot Camp compatibility.\nI have updated a MacBook Pro, Late 2008 or maybe Early 2009, without any problems from Windows 8.1 to 10.\nBy the way I also updated my Mac Pro, Early 2008, to Windows 10.\nThis machine was not even meant to be compatible for Windows 8. I simply ignored Boot Camp (installed version 3) and started updates as per the procedure above. \nThere are only a few keyboard keys which are disabled like brightness and loudness adjustments as well as the eject key, but this can be easily controlled from other menu items.\n", "Q: Eliminate com.adobe.ARMDC.Communicator.plist malware Running an Early '09 iMac with Mavericks. Earlier this month I began to see a pop up referencing a 'malware cleaner'. Below is a copy of items dated May 4th in the Launch Agents and Launch Daemons folders. Any thoughts on resolving this issue?\nHere are the May 4th items:\nLaunch Agents folder\n\n\n*\n\n*com.adobe.ARMDCHelper.cc24aef4a1b90ed56a725c38014c95072f92651fb65e1bf9c8e43c37a23d420d.plist\n\n\nLaunch Daemons Folder\n\n\n*\n\n*com.adobe.ARMDC.Communicator.plist\n\n*com.adobe.ARMDC.SMJobBlessHelper.plist\n\n\nA: These are probably real Adobe files, but I'm deleting them because I didn't authorize their installation and they're useless daemons running at launch. The \"ARM\" ones are apparently for alerting you to updates of Adobe Reader... and who uses that anymore?\nAnother one is com.adobe.fpsaud, 32-bit junk that's still lingering around to warn you about Flash player updates. It prompts warnings from Mac OS about being \"not optimized,\" because 32-bit support is deprecated.\nOne guy took the time to write up his exploration of these files and shows how to remove them here.\n\nA: I cannot speak of the ARMDC Launch Agents or Daemon specifically, but it could be the culprit. It could also be a revenant of a legitimate prior Adobe installation, as Adobe CC leaves A LOT of remaining files, even after running the uninstaller.\nI suspect there is advanced Mac malware in the wild that mascaradas as Adobe. I encountered something less blatant than pop ups, but I’m certain it’s no longer the obvious Update Adobe Flash malware that tricks uninformed users. I believe the use Adobe to mask thier malware because Adobe CC has massive bloat and is constantly updating, so it’s easier to hide if they have managed to get remote access.\nYou could delete them since you’re no longer using Adobe and see if the pop-ups disappear, but even then you wouldn’t know if your system has been compromised further.\n", "Q: Completely reinstall everything on the Mac Let's say that I am paranoid and I want not only to wipe and reinstall OS X, but also recovery, SMC, firmware and everything in the Mac hardware that could have been infected with malware. Is there any way to accomplish this?\n\nA: You could get a brand new SSD disk and install OS X on it, carefully clean wipe the current one.\nIn addition you could get EFI and SMC firmware from Apple.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT1557\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201518\nThe before you do anything (since the malware could creep right in again) install something like LittleSnich and block everything from to Network and only allow fully trusted stuff.\n", "Q: OSX Mail - Folder Locations In OSX mail, I have a number of different mailbox types - iCloud, Google Apps, and Exchange. For whatever reason, the Exchange mailbox displays the folders underneath the mailbox list at the top (see picture). iCloud and Google Apps do not do this (both are IMAP). Is there a reason for this? Any way to change that behavior? \n\n\nA: On iCloud/Google Apps you didn’t create the folders under “Inbox”, and so they appear further down in the pane you’ve screenshotted.\nOn the Exchange server you did create folders under the “Inbox”, and therefore that is where Mail.app displays them.\nOn my Zoho (IMAP account), I can either use the web client to create folder under the Inbox, or use Mail.app by ctrl+click on the Inbox I want to create a folder under and selecting “New mailbox...”, in the window that appears prefix the Name of the folder you want to create with “Inbox/” e.g. Inbox/foo.\nI tried the above on my iCloud account, but it didn’t seem to work.\n", "Q: Update to a newer version of OS X from OS X 10.6.8 Every time I click Software Update it tells me there's no new software! I don't even know what software I'm running so I can't search for updated software. Why is it stuck on 10.6.8?\n\nA: As others have mentioned, Lion (10.7) is the latest version of OS X supported by your machine. Although it's no longer available for download from the App Store, you can still order the media from the Apple Store.\n", "Q: How to recover iMessages sent to main phone number when using a different SIM card overseas? I am a U.S. AT&T customer with an unlocked iPhone 6 plus, but am currently travelling through Spain and using a pre-paid Vodafone SIM card. \nOne major problem I've run into: \nAfter inserting the new Vodafone SIM card, my AT&T number gets deactivated from iMessage and all messages being sent to that number aren't being delivered. \nMy questions are:\n1) Will the iMessages currently being sent to my AT&T number be delivered once I put my AT&T SIM back in?\n2) If not, what should I do so that I don't lose all of the messages that are being sent to my AT&T phone number?\n\nA: Apple stores iMessages on their servers only until they are sent to your device. Therefore, they will be sent to your iPhone once you put your original SIM back in. \nAnother option would be to add an email address to your iMessage account and then even messages sent to your original number will be forwarded to your phone with the temporary SIM in if it has the email address associated with your iMessage account. \n\nA: In my tests, sending an iMessage to a phone without SIM will result in the Not delivered status on the sender phone, and subsequent messages will be routed by SMS if the phone is configured to do so. \n\nThe receiving phone was connected via wifi to internet.\nPutting the SIM back will not remediate this problem (probably because it appears as a failure on the sender's phone). \nInterestingly, the SMSs sent during the test did arrive after the SIM was inserted.\nIn order to be reached at your associated email address instead, the person messaging you will have to directly choose that address as the destination. \nHere you can see a contact with two phone numbers and two email address but only two of them (one email and his mobile phone number) are iMessage destinations.\n\nThis makes everything more confusing because you'll end up with two (or more) different message threads for the same contact, with no easy way of sorting them out\n\n—not impossible though, you can enter each thread and click though Details in order to establish the associated destination.\n\nAfter further tests, I can't confirm the first part of my answer: I received messages connected to wifi without the SIM inserted. The only difference is that the person sending the messages had the Send as SMS option disabled.\n", "Q: Windows not updating folders from the OS X drive I have installed Windows 8.1 on my MBP through Bootcamp. Sometimes I encounter a strange issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into OS X, and move/delete/create some files, e.g. Desktop\\test_file.txt\n\n*Turn off the machine;\n\n*Turn on again (even after hours) and boot into Windows;\n\n*Look into D:/Users/user/Desktop, and there's no test_file.txt in it!

In defense of Apple, I have a 2007 iMac and Windows 8.1 is not approved for my model.\nI assume you are not using Core Storage. If so, you could try the free drivers from Paragon. See link HFS+ for Windows® 8/8.1 Free Edition\nNote: You can test for Core Storage by opening a Terminal application window and entering the following command.\ndiskutil  cs  list\n\nIf you are not using Core Storage, the result will be\nNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found\n\n\nA: I found my answer here. The culprit is Windows Fast Startup, that actually hibernates the file structure when turning off, and restores it when re-booting in.\nThus any changes happened between these two steps can't be really percieved by Windows. From what I read, it could even bring to data loss (if only it had write permissions towards my HFS+).\nSo, either you disable it, or you stick with the problem (but be sure not to have write permissions!). You should also make sure to unmount any external drive before hibernating / turning off Windows, otherwise there's real risk you'll be losing data.\nPersonally I'm gonna disable it.\n", "Q: How do I reset safari to a state equal to that of a new user?

My Macbook was hit  by my keys and crack the apple light on the back.\n\nIf I don't repair it, could this damage the sceen? The cover of Macbook is so thin that I really worry about this, but repair could be troublesome and expensive so I'd rather not have to fix it.\n\nA: Essentially it is not a light but is simply a hole covered with a piece of plastic. LED which are used as your screen backlight serve as the actual light for the apple mark, so the apple mark is not lit on when the screen is not lit on.\nIn short, a crack in Apple mark will is not going to influence your Macbook in any way.\n\nA: Same thing happened to me... It should be okay because my MacBook worked fine after and never exhibited any issues on the screen.\n\nA: same thing happened to me and for me its not really a matter of having the crack hurt the screen its the fact the crack is there. it is very annoying to see the crack but I don't feel it's worth repairing.\nIf you really are worried, place some clear tape over the Apple to ensure that the plastic doesn't move further towards the LCD and damage it. Also, a protective case over the back of the Aluminum might help deflect any further pressure.\nSince the cost to repair the plastic is basically as much as repairing the entire LCD - you might save your $$ until further damage happens.\n", "Q: How to loan my iPad while preserving personal data?

Is there any software, that would allow me to easily copy the content of these folders (with subfolders) to Dropbox in encrypted form?\n\nA: I am not so much familiar with Dropbox, but I'd assume an encrypted sparsebundle image would be suited quite well fro your task. For instance this site explains the procedure. \nIn essence you have to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*Click File > New > Blank Disk Image...\n\n\n*Customize your encrypted image file. I'd suggest to use sparsebundle disk image since it consists of smaller files and will probably result in better syncing performance with Dropbox.\n\n*Choose a strong password (and optionally save it in your keychain)\n\n*Now you can double-click the image file and it will open as a volume.\n\n\nThis is very safe and efficient.

Is there an alternative?\n\nA: After some playing around I found a workaround, not sure if there's something better:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Preview, close all documents, close Preview.\n\n*cd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Saved\\ Application\\ State/com.apple.Preview.savedState\n\n*chmod -w .\n\n*chmod -w *\nThere will be similar folders for other applications.\n\nA: As for the \"similar folders\" mentioned by Dalin, there are a bunch in ~/Library/Containers; but there may be another in ~/Library itself.\ncd ~/Library\nrm -rf 'Saved Application State'/*   # eliminate contents\nchmod 500 'Saved Application State'  # make it read-only\n\nThis blocks automatic saving for other applications in this location.\nYou can find the other 'Saved Application State' folders as follows:\ncd ~/Library/Containers\nfind . -name 'Saved *'\n\n", "Q: How to search installed application based on functionality? My Applications folder has 486 entries, applications that have accumulated in the 30 years I'm using Apple hardware and software. Sometimes I'm looking for \"that great application I have installed a few monts ago\" but I am unable to remember its name, and I can spend a long time searching for it among hundreds of other apps.\nTypical example: I installed Snagit during my last Parallels upgrade (it came as a bundle). It's a really great screen capture application, but how can I remember that \"Snagit\" is a screen capture application? As for its icon, it shows a white \"S\" on blue background, which isn't very helpful either.\nOn Unix there is apropos, but under Mac OSX this command only finds command line applications. \nOf course, there is the Web, but it is rather cumbersome to search the Web to find an application which is already on my harddisk. Not to mention the fact that some applications are hard to find even if you know exactly what they do.\nTake for example OmniDiskSweeper, I doubt I will ever find it through the query \"application that calculates the size of folders\".\nI thought of adding comments to applications, but I'm afraid they will disappear at the first update.\nIs there an application that will combine the information found on the Web with all applications I have on my disk, and be able to answer queries based on keywords or on a description of the task I need? (for example \"application, screen capture, installed in the last six months\"). I.e., an intelligent Spotlight (\"intelligent\" in the sense of the semantic Web).\nSo here is my need: find an application that does a specific task in an overcrowded Applications folder, out of a few keywords or out of a sentence describing it.\n\nA: You can use meta data. Select the app in Finder, press ⌘+i or secondary click -> Get Info.. There You have \"Comments\" section, where You can describe Your app (for example \"great screen capture app\"). Then You can search for an app in Spotlight using the keywords You privided. After upgrading the app, extended attributes are not erased.\n\nA: Just a thought, but it will require more than a bit of work.\nMake a text file with the name off all your applications in them. Write a brief description of each application along with any keywords you might associate with the application.\nSave it in your documents folder. When you do a Spotlight search enter a description of what you want to do and/or a keyword or two and the description will pop up inside that document pointing you in the right direction.\nOr you could just keep the document in your Dock, open it and do a keyword search...\n\nA: What I do is create folders in Launchpad, bundling apps with related functionality together with an explanatory title. Dupes & Hygiene; Systems & Code; Amnesia (for things like calendars & other life organizational tools); Communication; Finder Tweaks; Media Players; Photo & Visual Art; Browsers & Readers; and so on. I'd never be able to find anything if I didn't lump them together to remind myself what each one does.\n\nA: Try MacUpdate Desktop (http://www.macupdate.com). It has functionality you are looking for, i.e. searching installed apps and new ones by description... If app is installed it'll show you. If not, then you'll see 'Install' button. Hope this will help you.\n\n", "Q: How to share something into a Reminders list? Suppose you are viewing a webpage and need to set a reminder to do something with this page.

I'm using VMware Fusion 7.1.1 to run both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 on a mid 2014 15-inch retina Mac. I've heard it is possible to run VMware in such a way that the screen's native resolution (in my case, 2880x1800) is displayed without any scaling.\nAfter lots of trial and error, I discovered this works fine using the default desktop scaling in OSX. However, I normally run OSX in a scaled display setting (the default scaling makes everything too big to my tastes), where it actually renders everything at 3360x2100 and then downscales that to 2880x1800. It seems this also happens when using VMware Fusion, which means the perfect 2880x1800 picture from Windows gets stretched to 3360x2100, only to get scaled down to 2880x1800 again, leaving me with edges and text being blurrier than they should be.\nIs there any way to prevent this from happening? I'd rather not change back to default desktop scaling in OSX every time I want to use VMware Fusion.\n\nA: From here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the VMware Tools by selecting Virtual Machine → Install VMware Tools in the menubar. Follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n*Set Use full resolution for Retina display in VMware Fusion’s Settings → Display preferences panel.\n\n*Run this command in Terminal on your OS X guest VM and enter your password when requested: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true\n\n*Log out of your OS X guest VM and then re-login.\n\n*Resize your OS X guest VM window to your preferred dimensions.\n\n*In System Preferences → Displays, set the resolution to Scaled and then select the HiDPI setting.\n\n\nNote: If you resize your guest VM, it will revert to the non-HiDPI resolution. Simply re-select the HiDPI resolution in the System Preferences → Displays preferences panel.\n\nA: Look under settings for the Virtual machine and under the display settings should be a check box \nUse full resolution for retina display\nUncheck it.\n", "Q: Unable to cut from text edit and paste into terminal Up until a day ago, I was able to cut and paste commands into terminal from text edit.

Our OS X Server serves our company DNS, web and mail with an external IP address to the Internet.\nIt currently does not have a local address on the LAN and thus cannot be used e.g. for software update caches for OS X and IOS devices on the network. \nIf I were to also attach the server to the LAN by one of its other ports would I be compromising its security or the security of the LAN? \nI am more concerned about opening up a security hole from the WAN into the LAN than vice versa as I can control which users have access to which services on the Server. \nOS X Server has its adaptive firewall enabled and the router via which it connects to the WAN has only those ports open that we need for the services it serves. \n\nA: Nothing much will change in regards to WAN exposure, as long as you're not configuring the server to proxy or route any traffic. Services intended for the LAN only should be configured to only run on the appropriate interface, regardless of whether there's a firewall in place.\nThere is an increased risk if one of the externally facing services is compromised, potentially allowing access to resources on the LAN. If you want to be really careful you can set up the firewall on the Mac to not allow traffic out the LAN interface unless it originated on the Mac...\n", "Q: Clean Install MacBook Pro I have a 13\" MacBook Pro that Apple has lent me while my new 15\" is being built and I need to restore it to the same condition as the day I received it from Apple. How do I do that?\n\nA: You can do that by shutting down your computer, then when you turn it on press and hold command+option+R and wait a while (normally about 5 mins)\nOnce your in Internet Recovery go to disk utility and format your drive. After you have done that go to Install OS X and follow the instructions. This will create an clean install. Once you do that shutdown the computer and then you can give it back to them.

This account can't open standard directories like Documents or Pictures in the admin’s user folder. It can access however every single folder and document that does not belong to this preinstalled standard folders. Changing folder permissions in the admin account does not change anything. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: The simplest way to prevent the access is by Get Info.. (or ⌘+i on directory and setting the permissions there. \nTo prevent other user from viewing your files, settings should look like:\n\n\n*\n\n*username(me) read / write\n\n*everyone no access\n\n\nNote: remove all the other positions like group etc.\n", "Q: Permanently Enlarging the \"Open File\" dialog box in Yosemite Whenever I open a file in any application I'm presented with the standard \"Open\" dialog box which I find to be frustratingly small (less than 50% in each dimension on my 11 inch screen). I can enlarge it to a more generous size, but the new dimensions don't seem to be made permanent, so next time I open a file the standard small-size dialog is shown.\nIs there a way to permanently resize this dialog box?\n\nA: I tested this with TextEdit and it does not remember the size of it's open dialog window. I tested it with Script-Editor and BBEdit and they both remember the size.\nAfter reading something about another, maybe related situation, I tried this:\nI resized the open dialog in TextEdit like it is described here (second screenshot).\n[ which is: hold the SHIFT-key and click into the right side of the dialog and start dragging it ]\nAnd when I do that this way, TextEdit remembers the size, also between relaunches.\nSo may be this is possible with all applications you want to remember it's open dialog size?

It runs, among other stuff, the following services:\n\n\n*\n\n*Webserver (Apache, PHP, MySQL) i.e. OwnCloud/WebDAV\n\n*Torrent client\n\n*SSH server\n\n*VPN\n\n*Some game servers\n\n\nAlthough a MacBook is not the best hardware for the job, this works fine for private use and I have my backups running for the inevitable crash.\nTo keep unwanted people out, I have a 'normal' firewall and  fail2ban running.\nFail2ban scans log files (e.g. /var/log/apache/error_log) and bans IPs that show the malicious signs -- too many password failures, seeking for exploits, etc. Generally Fail2Ban is then used to update firewall rules to reject the IP addresses for a specified amount of time, although any arbitrary other action (e.g. sending an email) could also be configured. Out of the box Fail2Ban comes with filters for various services (apache, courier, ssh, etc).\nSetting fail2ban up is done by modifying different configuration files. In these files you can state 'which' log file to scan, what to look for (regex), and, if a match is found, what action to take. But setting it up can be a real hassle and takes hours for a normal guy like myself.\nIs there a good GUI or alternative for fail2ban? The main purpose is to block unwanted users from my system. I prefer open-sourced solutions, but I am also willing to pay for good software.\nnote: I have the 'regular' OS X 10.6.8 running (i.e. I do NOT have OS X Server running)\n\nA: You can use fail2web, but, as this is only a frontend to fail2ban, is not easier to use than modifying fail2ban's text files.\n", "Q: finding large videos in the OSX Photos app Is there a way to find all videos above a certain size using the new Photos app so that they can be selected for Export or put in an album?\nI'd like to move large videos off to an external drive, but I can't find a way to select them (or indeed, to find them at all).\n\nA: *\n\n*Navigate to Pictures folder\n\n*Right click on Photos Librar and Show Package Contents\n\n*Open the originals folder (prior to macOS 10.15 / Catalina, the 'originals' folder was named 'Masters')\n\n*In search bar, type mov, then choose Type 'Movie'\n\n*Make sure 'Masters' is still the search target\n\n*Right click the column headings and tick 'Size'\n\n*Click Size column header to sort\n\n\nDo not change anything in Finder.

The first one is a 17 incher from 4 years ago. I'm able to set the time that it sleeps. The second one is a 15 incher retina made this year. In its energy saver section, I don't see a way to set the sleep time. It only shows the display time. How do I make both slider controls show up on this new Macbook Pro?\n\n\nA: Deliberately Removed\nApple have removed the Computer slider from the Energy Saver settings. This is deliberate.\nThe decision is related to Apple's introduction of improved hardware, Power Nap support, and the engineers' belief that OS X is best placed to manage the computer's power state.\nIf you would like to see this slider return, provide feedback to Apple.\nDownloads and Other Long Running Tasks\nOS X will stay awake during most long running tasks.\nThe behaviour will depend on the software downloading the file. Safari and Transmission, for example, both ask OS X to stay awake while a download is ongoing.\nApplications need to lodge power assertions with OS X that explicitly stop the computer sleeping. You can see these assertions using the following pmset command:\npmset -g assertions\n\nFor older software, you can add this behaviour using the built-in command line tool caffeinate.\nThird Party Alternatives\nThird party tools exist to supplement the Energy Saver settings. I created Power Manager and it can put your Mac to sleep after inactivity.\nOther tools exist and you could probably create a script to also recreate this behaviour.\n\nA: Basically, Safari will download the file but it will not go to sleep. \nYou can also check the box that says \"Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off.\" I have that box unchecked;  power nap really, in this case, does help.  I've actually ended up answering one of my own questions by reading this thread.\n", "Q: What specifications does my iPhone 5c require to charge?

I use generic 5V buck converters, like this one, to charge from my solar system.\n\nA: Here or the specifications used by Apple's official charging cords. \n5 volts  1.0 amps\nIf your interested in making one for iPads you can use\n5.1 Volts and 2.1 Amps\nSource\n", "Q: Touch ID and password at the same time? Is it possible to require both Touch ID and a password in order to unlock an iPhone?\n\nA: It's not only possible – it's mandatory!\nApple knew that they can't trust their fingerprint sensor to work 100% of the time, so they won't even allow you to enable Touch ID unless you also set a passcode. Once you've set them up, they're both equally capable of unlocking your phone. You can either \"slide to unlock\" and enter your passcode or just scan your fingerprint - whatever you prefer!\nEdit for your clarification: Sorry for the misunderstanding! No, there's no way (Apple-approved; I'm not sure what jailbroken solutions exist) to have both layers of security at once. Either one can unlock your phone, but there's no way to require both. Like I said, Apple wants to always have a workaround for when the admittedly-fallible Touch ID reads a false negative. They'd never allow Touch ID to be an absolutely necessary component of the only way into your phone.\n", "Q: Messages.app (Mac) does not play sound when message received Why does Messages.app on my Mac (Yosemite) fail to play a sound when a message is received?\nOn my Mac, I'm hearing sound from other apps.

Changing that popup does not help.\nIn System Preferences > Notifications > Messages > Play sound for notifications is checked. Unchecking and rechecking does not help.\nThe only odd thing, the only clue, is that in System Preferences > Notifications > Messages I found the Messages alert style icons had \"None\" selected but nonetheless have been seeing the Alerts style notifications appear upon new messages. Perhaps there is some kind of settings file not being updated, and needs to be trashed?\n\nA: I had the same problem and I found that in System Preferences> Sound> Sound Effects:  The \"Alert volume\" was set at zero.  Adjusting it up solved my problem.\n\nA: I had the same problem, I think I found what it was, for me at least.\nSystem Preferences -> Sound Effects -> Play sound effects through: Internal Speakers\n\nA: My issue was a software program that somehow became my default sound program.

In this case, I am installing rEFInd Boot Manager, see http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html\nYet when manually installing software on Mac OS X, I often run across directions instructing users to choose between installing \"on the ESP\" or installing \"to an ordinary HFS+ volume\". This is a good example. \nI've never noticed a difference between the two installation methods. So, what difference do the two different installation methods make? Maybe I don't understand the difference between HFS Plus and EFI, so this could be a very stupid question.\n\nA: The ESP is normally used for the boot loader on ‘normal’ EFI systems, however on a Mac the ESP is not—it is usually empty, but has been used as a staging area for firmware updates.  A Mac will initially look in the ESP for anything to boot from, but if it is empty or non-existant, it will look for the root file system to boot from.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Mid 2012 Black Screen and No Picture On External Monitor.

I am sure the computer is powering up properly, as I can hear applications running in the background.\nI have reset the SMC and PRAM numerous times. As far as I can tell, there has been no damage to any parts of the logic board.\nDoes this mean my GPU is shot and my computer could function properly if I replaced it, or are there other parts I should be inspecting?\n\nA: Bad news, your GPU is shot.\nGood news- you might be eligible for a free repair by Apple.\n", "Q: Mac Mail receiving emails extremely slowly I recently purchased my first rMBP and I have noticed that Mail receives emails extremely slow.

However, I am worried about a hazard of some type, for example is there any risk of shock or fire or something else? \nImage shows bent pins, this is before I broke them off with the screwdriver. \n\n\nA: Even though the phone appears to be still working fine I would advice to get the device looked over and possibly repaired.\nThe main problem is without seeing which pins have broken off, the device maybe missing earth pins which could cause a risk of electrical shock, I would be very cautious when charging the device.\n\nThis should not cost to much as the port can be purchased fairly cheap on eBay.\n\n", "Q: Looking for deleted files on Photos I deleted photos and then looked for them under Photos, File, Show Recently Deleted, but the message says \"no recently deleted.\" Where are the deleted files??

I realize the OS takes up some space (on my iPad, \"Used\" + \"Available\" only equals 11.9GB), but looking at this screenshot, even my iPad can't accurately explain what's taking up 8.2 GB. I know it's not the OS because Used + Available is already lower than 16. And I added up all the apps underneath and only came to a little under 800MB. What on earth is taking up the remaining 7.5GB?!\n\nMy drawing to illustrate my question:\n\n\nA: These could be some temporary files - usually, after a restart they get deleted freeing precious space.\nWhen you connect iOS device to iTunes, these often show as \"other\" in Summary tab.\n\nA: Some corrupted files might be stuck on you device, and the best option is to start from scratch. Use iTunes to create a backup of your device, restore to the current iOS version, and restore the backup you created. \nCheck this page for more info about what might steal your precious space.\nI have had previous success doing a backup, reset and restore of my device to remove temporary files that are stuck on the device.\n\nA: This is an excellent summary showing the utility of a periodic erase / install on iOS to let the system reclaim all the space in the filesystem.\nOne a technical level, SSD storage is made up of multiple cells and there are more complicated storage overhead than a traditional hard drive. This allows for the capacity to not decrease to the user when bad cells are mapped out of service as well as to allow wear leveling. Over time, eventually every storage device will have more and more blocks fail and you would see the same drop off on usable storage. Also, each iOS version uses different amounts of space:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS 7 upgrade - how much space will I get back?\n\n*How large is iOS?\nI don't think the combination of OS overhead and bad blocks is the main cause for you, though. Based on your \"unaccounted\" size, it's likely orphaned files that no longer \"belong\" to any app.\nTo test this, make a backup of your iOS data to iCloud and/or to a computer and then restore the device.\nDo not add any apps or settings back on the device and repeat the storage measurement. Then you will know if the true capacity was as originally delivered from the factory. If so, all your loss and overhead was filesystem fragmentation, lost files that weren't marked as \"belonging\" to a specific app.\nIf you wipe and still have all that space \"lost\" then it might be technically accurate and a sign the storage doesn't give you the designed capacity and a \"repair\" would fix it by swapping the device for one with the correct amount of available storage.\n", "Q: How can I warp the border between two different sized monitors, so the mouse doesn't get stuck in the larger one? When the monitor on one side of the border has a resolution higher than the monitor on the other side, the mouse can only cross over to the other monitor at the part where their edges overlap, as in the configuration below.\n\nThis means that when the mouse is not in the overlapping area, for example in the upper area of the right monitor in the image, it can't cross over to the other monitor without moving to the overlapping area.\nIs there a way to warp the border, so that the proportional position of the mouse on the departing side is converted to the same proportion on the arriving side?\n\nA: It's just not possible, I'm afraid.\nEven with this setup, though I can move the mouse freely between the two screens, if I have a window tight to the top of the right hand screen, I must drop it far enough to clear the menu bar before it will drag to the left screen.\n\n", "Q: Running Time Mechine Backup from Recovery HD My MacBook seems to be getting kernel panics when booting up. I've decided to create a backup, reinstall OS X, and restore from the backup. But I can't create a Time Machine backup because I unable to boot into the main partition.\nMy question is: how do I run Time Machine from the Recovery HD, you can only restore. I've also tried tmutil, but the terminal does not want to run anything from the other partition.\n\nA: The Recovery HD doesn't have the ability to make a backup other than using Disk Utility or the terminal app to copy files.\nIf you have a spare HD available or don't want to risk reinstalling the OS (which isn't designed to delete any user files - but could if there is directory damage) I would say go buy a USB external drive and reformat it as GUID/Mac and use Disk Utility to \"restore\" the boot drive to the external drive. Then you can run the OS installer from Recovery or erase and install.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall Mac OS X Mountain Lion before selling a Mac\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\n", "Q: MacBook shut down at 20% battery with no warning? My 2013 13\" MacBook Retina (OS X 10.10.3, Yosemite) shuts down when I have about 20 minutes of battery left. Not sleep, full shut down. It does this with no warning at all. \nI seem to remember earlier Mac laptops giving me a low battery warning at around 20% and then putting the machine to sleep (hibernation?) when it gets real low... but never a full shut down. \nDoes my battery need to be recalibrated? Does the system inaccurately think it has some juice left? Worth mentioning, when I plug it back in and boot it back up, it claims to be at about 15%. \n\nUpdate: I've done the recalibration thing a couple of times now, but still no difference in performance. What's frustrating is that I never get the low battery warning and the machine doesn't sleep; it shuts down. I've done tons of Googling around and everything I find says exactly what Buscar웃SD suggests below. The one weird thing that I found on Apple's site is this: \n\n\"If your portable Mac has a built-in battery, you don’t need to\n  calibrate the battery.\"\n\nCan't say I've ever heard that before.\n\nA: I had the same problem with a MacBook Pro mid-2009. Even changing the battery for a \"non-official\" battery did not solve the problem; I had to take it to an authorised Apple service centre; after that, no problems and still happy as the writing of this (about two years).\nAny workaround that you might find online (resetting SMC and/or PRAM, recalibrating, etc) is just a temporary measure, they won't hurt at all and might give you some peace of mind.\nBesides changing the battery for a new one, the Apple tech guys have special \"secret\" programs that can modify certain system flags and parameters.\nAbout a year ago my MacBook Pro Retina mid-2012 (2.7 Quad i7) started with the same exact problem; the shocking news came with an estimate of $975.00 AUD to replace the battery (as it comes glued firmly to the housing you have to replace the unibody bottom including keyboard and trackpad). Still one year later the battery has not degraded at all and I still get 3-4 hours of battery life with full performance settings, but now the message has changed from \"Service Battery\" to \"Replace soon\", after this there is still a \"Replace now\" message.\nIn brief:\nService Battery means: \nThere might be something wrong with your battery, or it could be nothing, but keep an eye on it.\nReplace soon means:\nYour battery will last less than expected, but there should be no major issues, stay alert.\nReplace now means:\nIf you hate carrying around your charger have your battery (or the entire laptop) replaced.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Once in a while (like 3 months or more) you should recalibrate the batter charge percentage. The reason is each time it charges it uses the previous value as basis (and it is a assumption that one was correct) so the error accumulates.\nSo once in about 3-6 months, you should let your computer shut down because of a´batter warning. Now you did that it it should be behaving better now.\nIt is not recommended to do the discharge to often (the battery does not like that.)\n\nA: I have the same problem on MacBook Pro Retina, early 2013, OSX 10.10.5 Yosemite. Shutting down without warning around 22%. In the battery menu it says \"Service the battery\".\nThe reset of the SMC didn't help.\nYesterday I asked at Genius Bar about this. The answer was \"We need to investigate it and probably you will have to replace the battery.\" It is not free and they need to keep my computer for few days, not good option for me.\nAfter the visit at Apple I tried to drain the battery totally by restarting several times after it shut down. And it was shutting down again and again quite quickly, the charge indication was changing a bit irregularly, sometimes 17% then up to 19% then lower again. I left it for the night, restarted in the morning and it worked normally. The battery went down from around 18% to 2% and went to sleep normally. There was no more message about the Battery Service. Now plugged and charging, around 20% I have the \"Service battery\" message again.\nI do not find any fix for it.\n\nA: I have the same issue.\nProbable Cause:  If you let your computer \"overcharge\" meaning, you let it charge over night, or keep it connected to charger for a long duration after it has reached 100% you are damaging the battery.  On a monthly basis, you should let the battery \"die\" because it is good for the battery cycle, as I've been told my Mac tech experts.\nYou have to wonder why they can't or haven't re-engineered these machines to simply reject charge after 100% to not suffer this damage lest it is a typical profit-making scheme.\n", "Q: This movie requires Quicktime, which is not supported by this version of iTunes Running Yosemite 10.10.3 on a late 2009 iMac.

If not available use the Manage Custom Size and add new size (+) and the dimensions.\nExample:\n\nSet it up:\n\nNow go to Print (in TextEdit) and select the Printer & Scanner preferences and select default size.\n\nsize\n\n", "Q: Chrome Helper process...without Chrome running Recently I've noticed instances of Google Chrome Helper remaining running in my activity monitor long after I've shut Chrome down completely.

Only holding power down for 10sec to reboot snapped it out. Day later it started going into a constant reboot cycle, either with a 6-language message on a gray screen, or simply a Mac boot chord, followed by black apple on gray screen, and a progress bar that seems to only get to a third, before kernel panic occurs. It just reboots itself. Every 10th or so cycle, the OS actually boots up. It has booted in Safe Boot more frequently. Reinstalled OS. Same problem. Ran Geekbench - awful results on read / write, and other HD related functions. Graphics and memory - average. After frequently getting to Safe Boot, decided to zero-write and clean install. Same problem. Problem seems to be tied in with \"sleep\" function. No Mac repair person has been able to isolate the issue, they are all puzzled and just say \"get logic board replaced\". In verbose mode, it most often hangs during the \"fsck_hfs\" or just after \"Previous Shutdown Cause: 3\", \"DSMOS has arrived\" and \"Sandbox: denying permissions, but not always, it's a different line almost every time. It says \"removed 5 orphaned files\", but sometimes 4 or 1 file. \nThermal Sensor? Fans do blast like crazy. Makes no sense to do a costly Logic Board swap on a 6 year old machine, does it?\nThanks!\n\nA: If it most often hangs during fsck then I would lean pretty hard towards it being a drive failure. Also, resetting the PMU could be worth a shot. Does the battery hold a charge?\nIf so, shut down, unplug from charger, wait 5 minutes, seriously wait 5 minutes, then boot from the battery. shut down after boot, reconnect your power adapter. Boot. Notice I wrote shut down specifically and not re-boot. Give that a try.\nAs far as the fans going full blast- this is normal for safe mode boot. \n\nA: The shutdown cause 3 is a hard shutdown, although the shutdown cause -3 is usually associated with the thermal sensor. If you've negative 3, then you're advised to run Apple Service Diagnostics to check which sensor went beyond expected thermal limits.\nOtherwise if it's 3, then you should look for the reason somewhere else. In general positive codes relates due to software, and a negative relates to a hardware issues.\nSee: Are OS X shutdown cause and sleep cause numbers listed/explained anywhere?\nIf you've checked already your HD for any errors and fixed them, you should also try the followings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the SMC.\n\n*Reset NVRAM.\n\n*Run an Apple Hardware Test.\n\n*Log a kernel panic.\n\n", "Q: How to get tab completion for LaTeX in TextMate?

I've reinstalled OS X several times and feel things aren't running properly. Also, I also couldn't find a way to merge my Time Machine old backups with new one.\nThe problem I have is confirming that I actually got a new board installed. I have not found a way to confirm this. My Mac help isn't helpful and Google is even less helpful. Why is it so hard to confirm that new hardware is really installed after this repair?\n\nA: You can compare the serial number on the bottom of the laptop casing to the serial number shown in System Report by going to Apple Menu -> About This Mac. When I worked at Apple, it was known that replacement logic boards would carry the new SN (naturally) and that cases from the old SN would link to the new one. \nThe serial on the laptop itself is the original SN it shipped with (unless the bottom case has also been replaced) and can be found in very small print near the display hinge. On the Mac, check for an SN that diverges or is not present, as that indicates repair.\n\nA: Do you have a system report hanging around from before the repair?  If so, you could compare things like the AirPort MAC address (or any info cached on your router), any Thunderbolt specific addresses that appear.\nYou could use something like this to see if the logic board has a newer manufacture date?\n\nA: Because of an repair with an old macbook pro (2007) the repair service forgot to set the serial number of the new motherboard.\nBecause of this I had several problems with iCloud. For letting to correct this problem by this SP about 1800km/1118miles away I would have to drive/fly this long way. Therefore I searched if I could fix this problem myself because a different SP would cost perhaps. Then I found an image you can burn on CD/DVD (or anything else from what the macbook can boot). Then with this image anyone can set the serial number once. Perhaps then no one can change the serial number again but I do not know this for sure.\nFor more information: http://rogersm.net/icloud-problems-mountain-lion-serial-number\nBut it seems the AASP is advised to change the serial number and not to set the old serial number. It is sad you can not be really sure the new motherboard does not have the bug of the early systems and perhaps the motherboard has been produced with this bug. But I trust Apple they sent a fixed new motherboard to the SP or AASP.\nThat is why it is sadly wrong that in info under mac os x you can get the not falsified serial number.\nWhat I did not look: If you open you Mac(book) completely perhaps on motherboard is a number printed which says when and where the motherboard has been produced (as you can see in model number of an iOS device). I did not see if mac os x displays the model number of the motherboard or any device. But I do not recommend it if you have any guaranty yet else you might loose this guaranty by opening the Mac.\n=> It is therefore absolutely wrong to trust a MAC address or motherboard serial number is unique. Theoretically a MAC address shall be unique but practically on some network card or usb network devices one may change the MAC address.\nI know this because I am a bit informed about network security.\n\nA: You can't easily tell from software that you have a new board unless the technician failed to properly deserialize the part that was \"allegedly\" put in.  However, the Time Machine change makes me conclude you have a new board.\nYou could try dumping the hardware identity from the Time Machine backup directory:\nxattr -p com.apple.backupd.BackupMachineAddress /Volumes/yourBackupDrive/Backups.backupdb/yourMacName\n\nSince you paid for the repair, Apple should walk you though re-joining the Time Machine over the phone or via internet chat for free post repair.\nDid you have it serviced via mail in or at an authorized service provider or at a genius bar? The steps to get repair details can change a little - but you could start by calling AppleCare and asking them to read the technician notes that were left by the repair tech. There should be time stamps when it started repair - possibly a list of parts used, probably some test results they ran, etc... Usually a logic board has it's own internal serialization, but you need to open the hardware to see that or have knowledge of revisions on the boards. If the board was improved after it was made or someone checked the serial number on the board that was fitted in the factory initially, you could know that the one in there wasn't original.\nUnless you took a photo of the board that was installed or marked it before the repair, it's unlikely you can differentiate things from software.\nBasically, the evidence you can gather is mostly circumstantial unless you are in the forensics trade or work on machines as a trained repair technician that works on that model routinely.\n", "Q: Spotlight Massive (out of control at 100GB+) Macbook Pro, 500GB SSD, Yosemite 10.10.3\nIs there a way to determine what folder(s) are giving Spotlight grief?

I'm trying to rename a 16GB SD card (Untitled) using a MacBook Air but the Disk Utility won't let me rename/erase/reformat it. I am able to open the device and see all of its content but cannot rename it. The reason I want to rename it is so that 3rd party apps on an Android Smartphone can write to the SD card. Right now, only the native Android file manager can write to the Sd card.

Today I left my MBP Retina at local authorised Apple service (it's a mid 2012 model, and it's having some gfx issues), and then I got an email telling me that I have to go back there and decrypt my hard drive, because they can't test if it qualifies for the free repair program.\nIf I will have to do it, then what should I do before giving them my laptop back (is just disabling keychain and deleting important files ok)?\nWhy do they need me to decrypt the whole disk? Isn't it just the hardware thing?\n\nA: You should have to remove an EFI password or permit them to reset that since it prevents Service Providers from network booting to diagnostic images or selecting an attached bootable volume to run test software.\nYou don't need to decrypt FileVault 2 in any service I've ever seen unless you want them to log in to your user account and look at your software. With physical access they can wipe a drive, make a clone/copy of it, but encryption is your way to protect the contents of the files reasonably well without impacting service testing.\nMy guess is that the person communicating with you mis-spoke or mis-understood the notes from the technician and if you call them back (or have AppleCare update the case notes and alert the technician), they can confirm if you have EFI locked firmware password set.\nApple documents this in the repair terms and conditions both online and you should have received them before signing the machine in for service.\nTechnically, they could wipe your drive and reset all passwords per the terms, but generally they give you a courtesy notice before doing so intentionally.\nSee: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203253\nDespite my generally trusting Apple repair employees, I would not give a machine password to an AASP until I had a very good understanding of who in that organization would have access to it, how it would be protected and when it would be destroyed. As to an iCloud password, the bar for yielding that is far, far, far higher bordering on almost never ever.\n\nA: That indeed sounds very strange. Keep in mind that there can also be stores which only fake their licenese and aren't real service providers.\nIf you want to be sure, look up here: \nhttps://locate.apple.com/  | There you can search for official Apple Authorized Resellers.\nYou also could contact Apple-Support and ask them: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201232\n\nA: Repair centers generally need to boot your device. They do NOT need to access your account.\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need to remove an EFI password if there is one\n\n*If you use filevault just create a separate account for them. Something obvious like \"AppleService\" with \"password\" and delete it when they are done.

All Macs can do this, any service center that doesn't have a bootable external is borderline incompetent.\n\n*Remove the drive and tell them to boot from an external. How practical this is depends on the model and your screwdriver skills. Service centers do NOT need an internal drive unless you are sending it in for a drive or software issue. This option may have consequences for your warranty.\nI have returned a couple of machines without the drive, the service center said absolutely nothing about it.\n\nA: When I took my early 2011 into an official Apple Store for a battery replacement, I did have to give them my password, but I did not need to decrypt the drive\n\nA: Yes, they either need FileVault turned off or need you to enter the FileVault password to evaluate the Mac for the free repair program. The test used to see if the Mac qualifies for the program does not work on mid-2012 15-inch Retinas with FileVault enabled, unless someone enters the password into that test.

How do I get the program to recognize that I deleted the file? Or did I not delete enough of the right files?\n\nA: Never manually delete Time Machine files or directories from the Finder. Time Machine makes heavy use of directory hard-linking, which the Finder doesn't really handle correctly. Chances are your backup is damaged now, making the safest option being a wipe of your backup disk, and making a new backup.\n\nA: \nI manually deleted all backups by dragging the contents of my backup external hardrive into the trash\n\nYep. BIG mistake.\nSince your intention seems to be to erase the backups, go to Disk Utility and simply format the Time Machine drive. Takes 20 seconds.\nYou can ignore the trash, it will disappear after the reformat.\n\nA: The answer involves the command bypass. If you really want to delete files and/or folders (directories) from Time Machine (or anything else), this will do it.\nIn my case, I needed to remove Time Machine files from a external disk that contained other files. I could not simple reformat the partition.\nThe command bypass is hidden relatively deep in OS X. In Yosemite, the full path to bypass is shown below. \n/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass\n\nSince this is a fairly long path, I suggest when first opening a Terminal application window, enter the command shown below to create an alias.\nalias bypass=/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass\n\nNow. if you really want to show your computer who is in charge, enter the remove command as follows.\nbypass sudo rm -rf name\n\nHere, name can be either a file or directory. Be warned, this does not put anything in the Trash. The file or directory is permanently deleted.

So if there is a long list that goes off the page, it doesn't matter because the large ones that matter are directly above where you are typing on the command line, easily readable with barely any eye movement.\nThen you just cd into the largest few directories and repeat the same command again until you have found your files. (Hidden directories are automatically included by default.)\nNote: you'l get a couple of permission denied errors on Mac OS X from the flash player plugin folder, for example.\nRefinements: You may add prefixes like m to the command to print in megabytes, for example, e.g., du -md 1 | sort -n.

Even before there was GUI's, the ls command by default would not list these files for normal users. There is no reason you can not add a . prefix to your own file names.\nOn the other hand, using ._filename seems to be unique to OS X. One use of these filenames is to store addition information regarding files with the same name minus the ._ prefix. OS X even has a special command dot_clean to delete or merge these types of files.  \nIn my option, I would not risk deliberately using the ._ prefix in my filenames. You may get acceptable results now, but future versions of OS X may interpret such names differently.\nFor example, let's say you create a file called ._dave. Later could OS X end up creating a file called ._._dave?\nJust FYI:\nIt is possible to create a service that would allow you to set the hidden file flag for highlighted files using the Finder application.

If not, move it there.\nNow when you highlight one or more files using the Finder application, you can right click and select \"Set Hidden Flag\" to hide from the Finder application.\nA simular service named \"Reset Hidden Flag\" can be created using the same steps, with the following two exceptions. In step 6, change\ndo shell script \"chflags hidden \" & quoted form of POSIX path of current file\n\nto\ndo shell script \"chflags nohidden \" & quoted form of POSIX path of current file\n\nIn step 7, change to save as \"Reset Hidden Files\". \nOf course, you can not highlight the hidden files unless the Finder application displays them.

At the moment I have an App icon stuck at 'Loading...'.\nI have tried restarting the iPhone (holding down both home and side buttons at the same time) and I have also tried shutting down the iPhone (holding the side button and swiping).\nI have also tried deleting it as usual (holding the icon down and choosing delete but it doesn't go away).\nAny ideas on what I can do to get rid of this icon?\n\n\nA: Go to Settings → General → Storage & iCloud Usage → Manage Storage, select the app from the list, then tap Delete App.\n\nA: Here is the real solution:\nOn the surface, some of what others have posted is correct, but may not help you because you don't know which apps are the blockers.  The underlying problem is that all available download threads (was 10 for my iPhone SE) are being blocked on apps which either:\n 1. no longer exist in the app store or \n 2. are not compatible with the version of iOS installed on the device.\nAfter repeatedly pausing the downloads and going into the AppStore to \"reset\" the download state and rebooting, you can whittle yourself down to where there are only 10 apps waiting and they are all as I described.  From here, after a restart, if you start clicking on them you'll actually get the root-cause error message saying the app can't be installed and it will give you an option to delete it.\nThen when there are NO apps in the download queue, reboot one more time and you'll be able to go into the App Store once more and re-initiate downloads for your remaining apps that are still compatible and available.\nVERY painful, but this works.\n\nA: Certain apps might be frozen with a blank icon and their will be no way of removing them for days. By holding down on the home screen to delete the stuck app also won't work..  \nHere are instructions on how to delete these waiting applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your iPhone normally. See this link for instructions on how to restart your iPhone.\n\n*If the apps are still stuck on the home screen, try logging out of the App Store temporarily. Navigate to Settings -> Store -> Apple ID -> Sign Out. Now open the App Store and Navigate to the Featured section. Scroll to the bottom of the page and touch the Sign In -> Use Existing Apple ID. Log in and the stuck apps should reset.\n\n*Still have strange icons on the screen or frozen downloading apps? Connect your iPhone to the computer and open iTunes. Navigate to the app store. Install the apps you are having a problem with on the computer then sync your iPhone.\n\nA: Don't want to connect to iTunes or delete and re-install the app (along with all the settings you may have customized?) Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the app update got stuck at Loading... because of insufficient space free some: Settings... General... Storage & iCloud Usage... Storage: Manage Storage. Find a hog; either delete the app entirely or go into that app and manage its internal storage. (I find podcasts consume a lot and I will delete downloaded media files to free up space; or I will delete immediately (not just in 30 days) some unneeded pictures.) \n\n*Reboot the iPhone \n\n*Go into App Store, re-select Update All. It will appear as though you are stuck again.\n\n*Touch the update circle of the app that is stuck; the circle will switch back to the Update button.  \n\n*Select Update button and now the app update should complete.\n\n\nA: App or other window stuck in \"loading\" mode. Turn off/disconnect WIFI and then turn back on, should fix problem. Otherwise Go into \"General\" in \"Settings\", then Usage, then Manage Storage - should see a list of apps, delete it (the stuck in 'loading' mode one) and then reinstate it (turn it back on). \n\nA: I found this as help:\nIn AppStore - search for this app, press on the button which download (it won't download it again, but slove the issue).\n\nA: I found the culprit to be Google calendar. It was waiting for me to log into Google. Once I logged in this app loaded then all the rest loaded.\n\nA: I found out that the problem is caused because too many apps are being loaded at the same time. \nWhat i have done is that i paused all of them and then load one or two and it worked!!\n", "Q: How can I get iTunes to redownload a deleted Podcast item?

Is this something I can change?\n\nThere are two types of haptic feedback:\n\n\n*\n\n*System provided\n\n*Application provided\n\n\nThis means that in addition to the ones provided iOS, app developers can implement haptic feedback as they see fit.\nLooking at Apple Developer's Human Interface Guidelines, it states:\n\nSome system-provided interface elements, such as pickers, switches,\n  and sliders, automatically provide haptic feedback as users interact\n  with them. Your app can also ask the system to generate different\n  types of haptic feedback. iOS manages the strength and behavior of\n  this feedback.\n\nCan you (the end user) enable this manually?  Not unless the haptic feedback was implemented by the developer and gives you the option to selectively disable.  From a system-wide perspective, you can only enable or disable all of them.\n\nNot all devices support the full range of haptic feedback, and people can disable the feature entirely in Settings if they choose.\n\n", "Q: Why does iTunes fail to sync my iPhone?

We have spent a lot of time teaching students and faculty members that when they wish to turn off a laptop, they must click the Apple, then Shut Down and then WAIT UNTIL THE SCREEN TURNS BLACK. As indicated by the all caps, this has been a major problem in the past because students and faculty alike will click Shut Down, then immediately close the lid, thus suspending the machine in a state between log out and shut down. After many years of data corruption, constant reminders and re-education, the problem is finally at an all-time low. However, all of that is now in jeopardy due to a change in Yosemite.\nThe Problem: We are switching to OS 10.10 next year, and Apple has changed the shutdown screen from pure white to pure black, meaning the average user has practically no way to know when the machine is actually turned off. There is a small spinning progress circle in the bottom middle of the screen, but it is dull and almost imperceptible unless the brightness is way up and the environment is dark. This means that users will click Shut Down and then immediately close the lid once they see the black screen.\nThe Desired Result: In a perfect world, I would be able to set a custom shutdown screen that has text on it and is, you know, not not identical to a powered off screen. Alternatively, I could at least put large text on top of the black screen. I have not found any way to modify the shutdown screen for 10.10 or any other OS. Does anyone know any way to accomplish this?\nAnother Desired Result: It would be nice if I could replace the default spinning progress circle with something else that is bigger, brighter and actually visible. The only issue I see here is that the graphic is so small that regardless of what I created to go in its place, it would be ignored. If the graphic could be made larger, that would be a serious possibility. However, as with the above choice, I have not seen any evidence that it is possible. Does anyone know anything about this?\nThe Work-Arounds I've Pondered and/or Tried:\n1) Changing the shutdown timer to 1 or 2 seconds.\n-- I would like to avoid this if possible because of the issues that could occur if processes are constantly killed before gracefully ending. I realize this is not a constant issue, but it would happen. \n2) Turning on the keyboard backlight.\n-- This would technically work, because the keyboard backlight stays on until the machine is fully shut down. However, it is not practical. It drains the battery, not everyone wants it on, and there is no way to force it to stay on.\n3) Informing users to pay attention to physical things, such as HD vibration, fan airflow, noise etc.\n-- This is completely impractical, totally unreliable and would never work for the faculty, much less the students.\n4) Somehow configure the system beep to make noises until the power is turned off.\n-- I don't think it is possible to control the system beep that way, and besides, if there are more than two students in the same room there would be beeps all over the place and no way to know whose machine they came from. Also it would annoy everyone.\n5) Run a logout hook script that displays something on the screen that goes away only when the power turns off.\n-- I'm not entirely sure this is technically possible, because as the OS is shutting down, the processes that would need to be kept alive to run the message would either prevent shutdown altogether, or simply get killed as part of the shutdown process.\n6) Use a program like NoSleep or InsominaX to disable the lid closing behavior.\n-- When used in conjunction with completely disabling the ability to sleep and hibernate the computer, technically this functionality would work nicely for the laptop carts. However, it is not an ideal solution. The main issue is getting the programs to run reliably every time, which has not been my experience using them over the years. Secondly though, the program's menu bar icon would be visible and accessible to students; and they cannot be allowed to manipulate such settings.\n-- Furthermore, teachers need to be able to put their computer to sleep, and these programs make that an unreliable process. In my testing, if you put a computer to sleep by clicking Apple --> Sleep, closing the lid actually wakes the machine up. I've put a ticket in with each developer, but a response is unlikely I think.\n7) Add a command to a logout hook which turns the screen brightness up to 100%, create a LaunchAgent then returns it to 50% (or some other number) at boot up. \n-- In theory, with some luck and a lot of re-education it could work for the faculty laptops, but it is highly unlikely the students would have the presence of mind to pay attention to the degrees of blackness necessary to make a power on vs. power off judgement. \nAs you can see, I have put a lot of thought into this and done a lot of research, but so far I am still without a solid solution. I have found almost no references online to anyone making custom shutdown messages, or altering shutdown behaviors in the way that I am describing. What I have seen mostly involves changing the shutdown timer, commands for a dirty or forced shutdown, creating AppleScript to display messages to be clicked before shutdown begins, and so on.\nSo, does anyone have any ideas how I might proceed here?\n\nA: To solve data corruption, have users log out. Also, empower users to know if their backups are current and make it their responsibility to self-service restore activities.\nTo minimize restart times, have users restart the macs and sleep them when the login screen arrives (assuming you don't have auto-log in enabled). This makes much more sense to me since new classes should have everything prepped and the last class should clean up their mess. \nAll your workarounds seem like IT taking the cleanup burden from the users and also shouldering the data protection lead. When IT is seen as a second fail safe to be relied upon when the routine maintenance and operating throw an exception, your life will be much better. In turn, the staff and student's lives will be much better since you can then support the real problems and not be self-selecting and volunteering for all the janitorial work.\nAlso, having reboots be a monthly task is working well in most environments I'm aware of. If your software selection and testing is yielding leaky and crash-tastic performance, documenting that would be an excellent investment in the future so that the curriculum reflects the costs of maintenance since you are well aware of how real they can be when you don't have stable OS that can wipe things clean once a user logs out.\nWhen IT can be responsible for system stability and users responsible for user maintenance (log out and log in) and you can track reboots as a signal that users are not trained or that a quality defect has slipped past the testing group, life gets far more fun for IT.\nLastly, look at your MDM provider - with 150 macs under management, you'll reap significant benefits if you learn how to use that tool proactively. If you don't have one, start a bushel trial immediately and reach out to one or more vendors to learn how you can leverage tools to assist. Even if you end up rolling out scripts to tweak hooks, you'll want a solid framework for monitoring and change management rather than laying hands on every cart and interrupting staff constantly for inevitable changes and updates.\n\nA: this is kind of unrelated out-of-the-box thinking, but I'm wondering if it might indirectly solve the problem.\nif you enable verbose boot mode, it will show system startup and shutdown information. well it will mostly be useless information for most people.\nbut it may just be enough of a visual clue ( hey look there's text on the screen ) for users to understand that the system is still running.\nyou can temporarily enable this by holding Command+V during power on, you can then do a system shutdown watching the pretty words fly by.\nwell there are multiple ways to permanently enable it, i used OnyX.\nand since this is done in firmware, you see text until the system is fully off.\n", "Q: How to mimic Home Key of Centos or windows in terminal of OSx?

I want to use the latest version of git which I installed via Homebrew, so I needed to change my PATH variable to ensure OS X uses the Homebrew version instead of the outdated version that ships with OS X and Command Line Tools. This tutorial recommends simply running:\n$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\nThat's what I did and it worked great.\nMy question is: where did this command modify my PATH variable? I don't have ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.profile files in my home directory at all, but when I $ echo $PATH then the PATH appears correct and when running which git and git --version everything appears to point to the right place. I do see the correct paths listed in /etc/paths but if I add a test path using export from the command line then the test path does not appear in that file.\nAnother question: is this a good way to modify my PATH variable?\nFinal question: what are the advantages and disadvantages of this method?\nEdit: I do see the correct paths listed in /etc/paths but if I add a test path using $ export PATH=/test:$PATH then the test path does not appear in /etc/paths/, but it appears first when I run $ echo $PATH, however it is lost after rebooting.\n\nA: On June 3 you posted the following comment\n@DavidAnderson So if I understand correctly, running export PATH... from an interactive shell session only affects $PATH for that session and the newly added path is not saved anywhere (and therefore there is no file where the newly added path can be edited). E.g., if I run export PATH=/test:$PATH but I meant to export the /testing_123 dir instead, then my best option is to simply start a new session rather than attempt to locate and edit a file containing the erroneous /test dir (because there is no such file). Correct?\nMy response to your comment\nFrom the manual page for bash, I have extracted the following.\nA parameter is an entity that stores values.  It can be a name, a\nnumber, or one of the special characters listed below under Special\nParameters.  A variable is a parameter denoted by a name.  A variable \nhas a value and zero or more attributes.\n\nPATH is the name of a variable. Normally, this variable has only the export attribute turned on. The export attribute marks a variable for export to subsequent  commands via the environment. The export command turns on the export attribute, but in the case of the PATH variable, the export attribute is already turned on. Therefore, for the PATH variable, the next four commands are equivalent.\nPATH=/test:$PATH\nexport PATH=/test:$PATH\ndeclare PATH=/test:$PATH\ntypeset PATH=/test:$PATH\n\nAs for your comment, you are correct. There is no such file.\nIn the case of a mistake of the type you mentioned, I do not think starting a new session would be the best option. I would enter the command \ndeclare -p PATH\n\nand then highlight the output. You can then cut and paste the text as your next command. Before hitting the return key, use the other keys to correct your mistake.\nFor more information on this subject, see the manual page for bash. Either enter the command \nman bash\n\nor visit the site: bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell.\nIn response to your Edit:\nYes, you are suppose to lose /test in your PATH variable when you reboot. This is why you need to put an export command in your ~./profile file.\nOriginal answer:\nYou seem confused when the ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, and ~/.profile files execute. Maybe this will help.\nHere is how I set up my computer. I have three files: ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc and ~/.bashcm. If you are missing any of these, you can create them.\nWhen I start the Terminal application or select \"New Window\" from \"Shell\" on the menu bar, an interactive bash login shell is invoked. This shell executes the ~/.profile script at startup. You can substitute ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login for ~./profile if you wish. If an interactive bash shell that is not a login shell  is  started,  the shell reads  and executes commands from ~/.bashrc. The purpose of ~/.bashcm is to provide a common script to be executed by both ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc.\nHere is an example of a .profile file\necho in .profile\nsource ~/.bashcm\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/bin\necho exit .profile\n\nThe purpose of the echo commands are to illustrate when the scripts are executed. Once you are comfortable, you can either comment out or delete them.  The .profile file executes .bashcm script, then modifies the PATH variable and exits. An example .bashcm file is shown below.\necho in bashcm\nPS1='\\h:\\W \\u\\$ '\nalias home='cd ~'\necho exit .bashcm\n\nOther than the echo commands, .bashcm only sets the prompt and an alias. The example .bashrc file shown below simply executes the .bashcm script. Again the echo commands are just for illustration purposes.\necho in .bashrc\nsource ~/.bashcm\necho exit .bashrc\n\nIf I start the Terminal application and enter the commands\necho $PATH\nalias\nbash\necho $PATH\nalias\n\nin the window, I get the following.\n\nLast login: Wed May 27 14:48:19 on ttys000\nin .profile\nin bashcm\nexit .bashcm\nexit .profile\nSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/davidanderson/bin\nSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ alias\nalias home='cd ~'\nSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ bash\nin .bashrc\nin bashcm\nexit .bashcm\nexit .bashrc\nSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/davidanderson/bin\nSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ alias\nalias home='cd ~'\nSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ \n\n", "Q: How Do I Remove Remote Disc from Finder (not in the Sidebar) I've an iMac 10.10.3.

You can only learn it when you enable FileVault. If you want to know it you need to decrypt and start over.\nIf you don't know the recovery key, you don't know the FileVault 2 encryption password, and you cannot boot into a user account with unlock privileges you cannot recover the drive.\nApple wants you to store the recovery key in iCloud. That is something I will personally do in the future.

In Yosemite the App Store System Preferences pane has automatic updates for a few separate items:\n\"Install App updates\"\n\"Install OS X updates\"\n\"Install system data files and security updates\" \nApp updates would include 3rd party software as well as Pages, Numbers, iMovie, etc.\nI'm not clear on the other two. My guess is OS X updates includes things like 10.10.3, iTunes, Safari, Remote Desktop Client Update, Camera RAW, etc. My guess for system data files and security updates may include things like XProtect definitions, Security Update 2015-001, etc.\nAre those assumptions correct?\nWould 10.11.0 when it released be considered an \"OS X update\" and be automatically installed?\nI've found these articles (one two) with conflicting info, but an haven't located an official knowledge base article from Apple with definitive answers.\n\nA: You're correct.\nI have \"Install App updates\" and \"Install system data files and security updates\" checked in System Preferences and \"Install OS X updates\" deselected, and exactly what you describe is what I observe.\nOS X Updates are user-facing updates that directly affect the user, regardless of whether the user actually uses the respective app (e.g. RAW updates).\nThe system/security updates are the Security Updates and File Quarantine (XProtect) definitions.\nIn the last 30 days according to my App Store Updates tab, the following was not auto-installed for me with \"Install OS X updates\" disabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command Line Tools (OS X 10.10) 6.3\n\n*Digital Camera RAW Compatibility Update 6.04\n\n*Remote Desktop Client Update 3.8.4\n\n\nOS X 10.11.0 would be considered a separate app on the App Store, so it wouldn't be automatically updated from a version prior to 10.11.0 regardless of the settings.\n\nA: Apple documents the difference between an update and an upgrade as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201564\nUpdates within each named OS include security, performance and sometimes new features. They are focused on the first two.\nUpgrade is from Lion to Mountain Lion or Mavericks to Yosemite. These are primarily about large feature introductions and major changes.\nSometimes a big change will arrive as an update, but in general you have to purchase (even if it's a free redemption) upgrades whereas updates can be automated with the software update app and or the software update portion of the Mac App Store.\nHistorically, the two were separate, but it's a bit more confusing now since everything the normal end user sees is in the App Store app.\nYou can see what updates are pending by running the command softwareupdate -l in terminal and it will only list system updates.\n\nA: \"Install system data and security updates\"\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes (often)\n\n*System update, very rarely\n\n\n(only macOS Mojave 10.14.5, Security Update 2019-003 High Sierra, Security Update 2019-003 Sierra)\nNOT\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari\n\n\nNOTE: From a system with \"Automatically check for updates\" and only \"Install system data and security updates\"\nFor the last few years, running El Capitan -> Sierra, has only visibly auto-updated iTunes. \nApple provides a list of the items it does put into this channel in this article:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207005#secconfigupdates\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207005#systemdatafiles\n", "Q: Mouse Pointer Locator Due to a stroke, I have had some vision impairment in that I sometimes have a hard time locating my mouse pointer on the screen.  I have tried making the mouse pointer larger which helps but is still not the solution.\nI am new to the Mac world and would appreciate your help.\nIn Windows, there is an option where pressing the CTRL key will help to identify the mouse pointer using a temporary display of several radiating concentric circles around the mouse pointer.  Is there something like this on OS X?\n\nA: Pointer Finder\nThis app will put a circle around your cursor when you press a key.\n\n\nA: With OS X El Capitan and later, all you need to do is move the mouse back and forth quickly, and it will automatically make the mouse bigger. The advantage of this is that you don't need to manually set your mouse to a bigger size if you don't want to.\nIf this doesn't work for you, the option to turn it on can be found in System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Shake mouse pointer to locate.\n\nA: Mouse Locator\nHighlights the cursor with a green circle upon keypress.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Highly visible locator instantly reveals your mouse position.\n  \n*Controllable trigger time period, from 1 second to 30 minutes.\n  \n*Eliminates the frustrating search of your screen.\n  \n\n\n\nA: Mac OS X's built-in option is restricted to increasing the mouse cursor size. System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Display -> Cursor Size While this will help with your issue by making the mouse easier to find, it doesn't highlight the mouse, and you get side effects such as a larger mouse text selection tool which makes it harder to work with text. \nThe old go-to solution was OmniGroups's OmniDazzle, but this no longer works on most current Macs.

It does what you want, but has limited configuration and the style a bit unpolished. \nThe most sophisticated option is Mouseposé which is a polished application with very nice animation effects for highlighting the mouse. It has many other features which are very useful during presentations or creating screencasts such as effects on clicking buttons and displaying keystrokes on the screen. Check out their video to see what it can do.\n\nA: Mouseposé\nMouseposè will highlight the cursor using a customisable dimming of the rest of the screen, and can zoom to the cursor's location.\n\nOf course, there are other uses as well.

When requested during the full disk encryption process, one option is to store the recovery key in your iCloud account.  \nI stored mine in iCloud, but frankly I'm confused as when I look at the drive contents I see NO files even indicating a recovery key.\nSo what exactly is happening?  Also, how is this used during the recovery process?\nAlso, if you put your recovery key in iCloud, how is more than one device handled (i.e. macbooks)?\n\nA: The recovery key absolutely isn’t stored locally by Apple, so you either need a safe place to store it where you won’t lose it or Apple will help store it for you to recover later when you choose to unlock the Mac by reading the key from iCloud. \n\n\n*\n\n*in a nutshell, your iCloud password gets you your key back instead of you needing to choose where to store it (paper in a safe, 1Password app, word document, under the keyboard, screen capture of the image of your key on screen, etc...)\n\n", "Q: How to stop finder copying files to a second hard disk Is there any way to to tell Finder to default to moving rather than copying files from my main system disk to another disk?\nMy main system disk is too small and I have a secondary 'main' disk which I use for media, larger files and the like. I know I can hold down Command to change the behaviour transfer by transfer, but sometimes I forget or hit the wrong key or Finder just decides it'll do a copy anyway. Move, rather than copy, is almost always what I want when transferring files between these two disks so that would be a better default for me.\n\nA: As far as I am concerned, there is no way to change the default behaviour.\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard\nMake your selection in Finder and hit CMD+C.\nOpen the target folder and hit CMD+Alt+V and Finder will move the files to your desired location.\n\n\n*Mouse\nHold CMD while you drop your selection to the target folder.

Recently a new \"glitch\" has surfaced over the Internet over the last few weeks where if an iPhone user is sent:\n  effective. \n      Power\n           لُلُصّبُلُلصّبُررً ॣ ॣh ॣ ॣ\n 冗\n\nvia iMessage it crashes the phone OS temporarily and force restarts the receiving phone.\nWhy does this work?\n\nA: It is something for Apple to fix.\nThe problem appears to come from the way that the phone tries to show the message in notifications. The characters cause that system to break, so that it briefly tries to show it before crashing and then re-setting the phone in an attempt to fix it.\nHere are some short term fixes you can do till Apple fixes the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Have the person who sent you the malicious message send another\nmessage effectively canceling out the initial strand\n\n*Send yourself a message via Siri, the share sheet, or from your Mac.\n\n*Another reader notes that “sending a photo to the contact via the Photos app can allow them to access the message history and\ndelete the conversation”\nsource: http://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-fix-ios-text-messages-crash-bug/\n\nA: If you need a fix for this, use Siri or a Mac using iMessage to send yourself a new message. See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204897\nIt's a three step procedure to recover and a future software update will patch this bug.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask Siri to \"read unread messages.\"\n\n*Use Siri to reply to the malicious message. After you reply, you'll be able to open Messages again.\n\n*If the issue continues, tap and hold the malicious message, tap More, and delete the message from the thread.\n\n\n\nAs to why it happens, it's a specific bug in the way Notification Center renders the Unicode content of this message. The code performs an \"unsafe\" operation (something akin to 5 divided by 0 and then doesn't check for an unexpected results) that causes an unhandled error.  \nThen since Notification Center can not render the block of text and ultimately crashes the Springboard which didn't have code to handle this failure gracefully.\nWhen no specific error handler is present, most operations have a fail safe \"reboot yourself\" to try and remedy the error.\nUnicode is a way of encoding characters used to handle languages that have a greater character count than English. Programmers can have problems with it because they learned to program using ASCII text and they neglect to write their software with full Unicode support.\nOne good article on this explains \"if you're still programming that way, you're not much better than a medical doctor who doesn't believe in germs\".\nThis other article explains this specific situation well.\nApple could either do tighter code reviews, have specific unit tests or let end users fuzz test their code like in this and similar cases.\n", "Q: How to use Boot Camp Assistant to create a dual OS X, Ubuntu system? I would like to use Boot Camp Assistant to partition my HD, reserving around 30 GB for Ubuntu. I would then have a dual OS X Yosemite and Ubuntu Linux system.\nThis used to be fairly easy. Boot Camp Assistant would partition the HD, then you could quit, and then using some boot manager software like rEFIt (now rEFInd), you could use that reserved space to install Ubuntu. \nNow, I'm not so sure. Boot Camp Assistant gives me three options: \n(1) Create a Windows 7 or later version install disk\n(2) Download the latest Windows support software from Apple\n(3) Install Windows 7 or later version\nFor (1), I need a Windows ISO image. I cannot do with without a Windows product key.\n(2) just downloads Windows support software to a 16 GB USB port of mine, and then...Boot Camp Assistant quits. \n(3) doesn't work, as apparently I need an installer disc.\nHow should Yosemite use Boot Camp Assistant to partition their HD? Why is Apple doing this to us? \n\nA: Personally, I would avoid using BootCamp altogether.  I would look at VirtualBox as a free solution to run Ubuntu on your Mac.  If it does not provide everything you require, you might try a demo of VMWare Fusion for OS X.  It will support things like KVM Hypervisor in a VM, which VBox will not.\nIf you insist on a native Ubuntu running on bare metal, just use Disk Manager to resize your system partition, add a second partition and install Ubuntu on the second partition.  You will likely clobber your apple boot record, but you should be able to restore that by using the Recovery Boot Partition and repairing your OS X installation.\nAfter you have Ubuntu installed on a partition, try to use the boot menu to select the partition from which you wish to boot.  You get the boot menu by pressing and holding the option key after the boot sound and before the grey screen.  It will present a list of system devices that are detected.  It will also include USB drives, if that is a path you wish to take instead.  Select the one from which you want to boot, and hit enter.\nThat should/might work.  I haven't used a dual-boot Mac in some time as I use VMWare instead.\n", "Q: Can not get the phone to accept a password My 5s is driving me crazy.  I can not open Apple of iCloud because it always rejects my password.  I'll go to Apple or icloud via my computer and change it, and then try opening it a few times.  Always works OK.  BUT, then I try to open it with the phone - and it is rejected for incorrect password. \n\nA: Usually two things cause this (or more precisely, one of the two):\n\n\n*\n\n*corrupt keychain items or corrupt software install\n\n*wrong date/time on the iOS device\n\n\nThe date/time is far easier to fix, so ensure the clock is accurate within a minute of reality / the PC that's working.\nCorruption is harder, so try powering off the device and back on, then try a backup and reset all settings. If that doesn't work, then a restore is next. Once you have a working sign in, you can erase again and then restore the backup or just reload the things you need and forget the backup eventually.\n", "Q: How do I share an optical drive with Windows? I need to install something from a CD on my PC, but it doesn't have an optical drive.  I have an optical drive on my Mac.\nI have enabled \"DVD or CD Sharing\" from System Preferences:Sharing.  However, when I browse to my Mac on the Network (e.g. \\\\OSXHostName I don't see the optical drive show up.)\nIf I add the drive as a shared folder, then I can see it under (e.g.) \\\\OSXHostName\\OFFICE12 but when I double click on it, I get a dialog box telling me it \"is not accessible. You might not have permssion to use this network resource...\"  But in file sharing everyone has at least read-only access.\nI did find one trick mentioned, whereby one creates a symlink from the mounted optical drive to one's home directory, e.g. ln -s /Volumes/OFFICE12 ~/OFFICE12.  But when I do that it doesn't show up (it seems to be hidden) and if I try to manually enter the path into Windows Explorer it says \"This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action...\"\nI have no problem accessing the home folder on my Mac.\nAll the instructions I seem to find mention sharing an optical disk on a Windows PC to a Mac, or sharing an optical disk from one Mac to another.  How do I share an optical disk from the Mac to Windows?  I expected it to \"just work\".\n\nA: It would appear tubedogg is correct. Or at least I know of no reason he/she is wrong. HOWEVER, while you may not be able to share the optical drive, it does appear you can share the content (CD or DVD) in the drive. This means you must insert the disk into the optical drive before enabling the sharing of the content with the Windows machine. I have verified this for both a data DVD and music CD.\nSetup with Empty Optical Drive on the Mac\nThe Finder shows the following. The Coelacanth and Marlin are the only visible internal drive partitions on the Mac named Marlin. \n\nSharing under System Preferences shows the following. The only shared folders are each user's default public folder. The \"File Sharing\" box is checked off, as well as, all boxes in the \"Options...\" popup window. The \"DVD or CD Sharing\" box is not checked off. \n\nNote: \"Screen Sharing\" is only checked off, because the two computers are currently connected using VNC. I verified this has no effect on this answer.\nOn the Windows PC side, the machine named Shark displays the following. Here, the Mac is already sharing its folders with the Windows PC. The internal drive partitions \"Linux HFS+ ESP\" and \"rEFInd\" are flagged as hidden so they did not appear in the Finder window shown above.\n\nSetup after Inserting a Data DVD Into the Optical Drive on the Mac\nThe DVD now appears in the Finder, as shown below.\n\nI clicked the + symbol and added the DVD to the list of shared folders shown on the Sharing window of the System Preferences. The result is shown below.\n\nThis results in the DVD automatically appearing on the Windows machine, as shown below.\n\nI can now open this folder and access the files on the DVD.\n\n\nA: An alternative, to accessing the Mac's optical drive from Windows PC machine, would be to create an .iso file to use on the Windows machine. The steps are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the optical drive on the Mac to create an .iso file from the CD/DVD.\nSee Mac OS X: Best Way to Make an ISO from a CD or DVD for ways\nto accomplish this. To test, I used the first 9 steps given here.\n\n*Transfer the .iso file to the Windows PC machine.\n\n*Right click the file and select Mount.\n\n", "Q: Mac says I'm using more space than I have?

Ignore exact numbers I deleted quite a few things last night (completely irrelevant to the movies). \n\n\nA: Regardless of third party applications, if the system drive information is showing file system inconsistencies, there are a few possibilities. Try each of the following in order until the problem is fixed. \n1) Empty the Trash and reboot your machine in Safe Mode. Once you login, reboot normally. \n2) Boot into macOS Recovery (command+R at the chime). Repair your normal startup volume using Disk Utility. While you can do this \"in live mode\" during normal operation, it's not as reliable as checking the volume from your recovery partition in recovery mode. \n3) Reindex your drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu () > System Preferences > Spotlight > The Privacy tab.\n\n*Click the Add (+) button and select your boot volume from the sidebar (sometimes under devices)\n\n*Wait 10 seconds. Select the same item and click the Remove (–) button to remove it from the list.\n\n*Quit System Preferences. Spotlight will reindex the contents of the folder or disk.\n\n\n4) If (3) doesn't work, then forcibly reindex your drive from the terminal using the following command (admin privileges required):\nsudo mdutil -E /\n\n\nA: It's possible that there are some hard links pointing to video files which is confusing the storage calculator.  Time Machine will do this; but, it should not occur on your main partition.  So, the exact cause is a mystery.\nFor example, for a 3GB file linked to two locations, the space might calculate as 6GB (3GB plus 3GB), even though only 3GB is used.  \nThere is this question at Super User which might help you isolate the files as well.\n\nA: If you have Final Cut then check out this video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiEGGjYPB_I\nIt has to do with files rendering and back-ups being made every so often...this video saved me\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: safari \"find\" does not work for partial word Sorry but I don't know how to describe this problem.

In computing, performance per watt is a measure of the energy efficiency of a particular computer architecture or computer hardware. Literally, it measures the rate of computation that can be delivered by a computer for every watt of power consumed.\n2.5GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7 = 21.05 pt/W\n2.8GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7 = 33.4 pt/W\nSo, when only looking at the 'performance per watt' you would be better of with the 2.8GHz\nSources used: Wikipedia, cpuboss.com - 2.5GHz, cpuboss.com - 2.8GHz\nnote: not 100% sure if I picked the correct processor types.\n\nA: Considering two CPUs of the same generation (i.e. same die manufacturing process), I would expect the higher clock rate to induce some -perhaps small- increase in power consumption, as noted by CousinCocaine. This need not affect battery life directly, however:\n\n\n*\n\n*Increased power consumption means increased heat production within the same closed space of your laptop.\n\n*With the higher-clocked CPU, although your CPU fan will kick in sooner (which means more energy consumption), there may be still be a slightly higher ambient temperature within the case.\n\n*Batteries don't like high temperatures. \n\n\nBasically, what it boils down to is that modern laptops have huge batteries occupying a large proportion of the case. This results in longer battery charge duration, but reduces airflow. \nNow, I do not have any actual numbers on battery life in similar laptops with different CPUs, so other factors may also be as important.\n", "Q: Change preset settings in OS X print dialog (Canon iR-ADV 2030i) I'm using OS X 10.9.

They use delta updates, only downloading a 'patch' which is applied on top of the system.\nYou can download the patch yourself if you really want based on the version of iOS that you're currently on and what version you want to update to, but that's not going to help you, because…\n\n*OTA updates don't work on jailbroken devices.

Some still seem to be unchanged since I created them, some got closed silently and there is only one where I ever got notified that the fix would be in the next OS X release.\nSo basically you filed the report, now just ignore it :-)\n\nA: Additionally, you should file your bug on Open Radar, that is a community maintain website who tries to keep as much reports public. A radar basically contains just the same information you report to Apple.\nNote that, usually OSX/iOS developers ask for help regarding concrete radars, this is because \"we suppose/believe\" that if lots of people reports the same bug, it will be fixed soon.

The time depends how on its Rank and whether the bug was described accurately.\nIf it's major issue, I believe it'll get the response fairly quickly.\n", "Q: How can I open a System 9 FileMaker document in OS X 10.9? I need to print some FileMaker pages that I created in System 9 (MacOS 9). Is there any free OS X 10.9 software that will open those files?\n\nA: Which version of FIleMaker created the file that you wish to open?\nPresumably, you are talking about a file created by FileMaker 5 or prior, which was the last version not to support OS X, which was introduced in FileMaker 5.5 (April 2001). MacOS 9 support was dropped in FileMaker 7 (March 2004). Source Wikipedia: FileMaker Version History.\nRegardless, the current versions of FileMaker (v14 was released just this month) only offer backwards compatibility with files created with earlier recent versions of FileMaker (v13 and v12). v11 and earlier need to be converted to the latest file format in order for them to be opened with FileMaker Pro 14. Thanks to user3439894 for that information. \nHowever, I guess that you are looking for a free database application that offers compatibility with FileMaker. I would have suggested OpenOffice or LibreOffice. However as user3439894 has commented below, you can not by default, open FileMaker files with these two applications, unfortunately.\n", "Q: Restore app windows to their original Spaces When re-opening an app, all of its windows end up on the first Space, regardless of their original placement:\nOriginal layout: one app has two windows open, each in a separate Space\n+-----[ Space 1 ]-----+  +-----[ Space 2 ]-----+\n|                     |  |                     |\n|  [Chrome window 1]  |  |  [Chrome window 2]  |\n|                     |  |                     |\n|                     |  |                     |\n+---------------------+  +---------------------+\n\nIncorrect layout after app restart: both windows are in the first Space\n+-----[ Space 1 ]-----+  +-----[ Space 2 ]-----+\n|                     |  |                     |\n|  [Chrome window 1]  |  |                     |\n|  [Chrome window 2]  |  |                     |\n|                     |  |                     |\n+---------------------+  +---------------------+\n\n\nIs there a setting or an app that would make it possible to have apps restore their windows in the Spaces they were originally located before the app was quit? \n\nA: I don't have a complete answer, but today, I started a decent stab at this issue using applescript.  The following Applescript does roughly half the job.  It reports all the windows of every application open on every desktop.  The next step is to record all this in a file and then implement a script to redistribute the windows after reboot:\n--This applescript reports a list of application windows present on each desktop\n--This is only a sample script intended to eventually be used to restore all application windows to their pre-reboot desktops\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    set windows_string to \"\"\n    set numDesktops to (first paragraph of (do shell script \"strings ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spaces.plist | grep -c ^\\\\\\\\$\")) + 1\n    --the following tcsh command can determine the number of desktops:\n    -- @ x = ( `strings ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spaces.plist | grep -c '^\\$'` + 1 ); echo $x\n\n    -- switch to the first desktop:\n    repeat with aDesktop from 1 to numDesktops\n        key code 123 using {control down}\n    end repeat\n\n    repeat with aDesktop from 1 to numDesktops\n\n        set windows_string to windows_string & return & return & \"Desktop \" & (aDesktop as string) & return\n        delay 1\n        get (the name of every application process whose class of windows contains window)\n\n        repeat with P in the result\n\n            set windows_string to windows_string & return & return & P & return\n\n            get (every window of process (contents of P) whose value of attribute \"AXMinimized\" is false)\n\n            repeat with W in the result\n\n                set window_name to ((name of W) as string)\n\n                --Stickies window names can be multi-line, so this trims from the first hard return onward\n                set better_window_name to (my replacePattern:\"[\\\\n].*\" inString:window_name usingThis:\"\")\n                if window_name is not equal to \"\" then\n                    try\n                        set windows_string to windows_string & better_window_name & return\n                    on error\n                        set windows_string to windows_string & \"couldn't get window name\" & return\n                    end try\n                end if\n\n            end repeat\n\n        end repeat\n\n        --switch to the next desktop\n        key code 124 using {control down}\n\n    end repeat\n\n    display dialog \"List of windows on this desktop: \" & return & return & windows_string\n\nend tell\n\n--Call like this: set res to my replacePattern:\"\\\\s+\" inString:\"1 subtratcing-these: -2 3 4\" usingThis:\"-\"\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse scripting additions\n\non replacePattern:thePattern inString:theString usingThis:theTemplate\n    set theRegEx to current application's NSRegularExpression's regularExpressionWithPattern:thePattern options:0 |error|:(missing value)\n    set theResult to theRegEx's stringByReplacingMatchesInString:theString options:0 range:{location:0, |length|:length of theString} withTemplate:theTemplate\n    return theResult as text\nend replacePattern:inString:usingThis:\n\nHere's an example of what's the the resulting dialog I get:\nList of windows on this desktop: \n\n\n\nDesktop 1\n\n\niTunes\nMiniPlayer\n\n\nFluidApp\nFound 626 tickets\n\n\nStickies\nuseful commands\nSystem Config Notes\nSpecial characters\nProfile where a python scri…\nXEMacs Tricks\nTerminal Tips\n\n\nMessages\nMessages (3 unread)\n\n\nFluidApp\nFound 626 tickets\n\n\nSlack\nSlack - Princeton NPLC\n\n\nFluidApp\nFound 626 tickets\n\n\nDesktop 2\n\n\niTunes\nMiniPlayer\n\n\nFluidApp\nFound 626 tickets\n\n\nStickies\nDAI\n\n\nMessages\nMessages (3 unread)\n\n\nFluidApp\nFound 626 tickets\n\n\nSlack\nSlack - Princeton NPLC\n\n\nFluidApp\nFound 626 tickets\n\n\nDesktop 3\n\n\niTunes\nMiniPlayer\n\n\nFinder\nSearching “Scripts”\nSearching “Scripts”\nSearching “Scripts”\n\n\nFluidApp\nFound 626 tickets\n\n\nStickies\nRPST\nIssues to resolve with RPST…\n\n\nMessages\nMessages (3 unread)\n\n\nFluidApp\nFound 626 tickets\n\n\nTerminal\nTerminal — -csh\n\n\nTextEdit\nUntitled 35.txt\nUntitled 34.txt\nUntitled 27.txt\nUntitled 15.txt\n\n\nSlack\nSlack - Princeton NPLC\n\n\nSafari\nAppleScript: Essential Sub-Routines\nUsing Applescript to Execute a Complicated Keystroke - Stack Overflow\nHow to restore windows to their original desktops after reboot?

The new bug id in Chromium is 1012034, and it still needs your votes!\nedit: It was implemented in the latest development version (Chrome 79)!\nThough, by default, in compliance with Apple's UI requirements, this feature still won't restore the workspaces if you exited Chrome with Cmd-Q. Quoting sdy, the feature author:\n\nFor folks who want Chrome to always restore windows to their original spaces, you can set that by running this command in a terminal window (for Canary, use com.google.Chrome.canary):\ndefaults write com.google.Chrome NSWindowRestoresWorkspaceAtLaunch -bool YES\n\nTo go back to the default behavior, run:\ndefaults delete com.google.Chrome NSWindowRestoresWorkspaceAtLaunch\n\n\nOriginal answer:\nThere is a bug #74812 in Chromium. Vote for it!\nSame question on Superuser.\n\nA: I am aware that my answer doesn't address your issue but it is a close workaround. I am using a software called Cinch and SizeUp to reposition windows.\nResizing a window across space and screen is really fast and is done using keyboard shortcut.\nThe software comes with a trial version for you to test it.\nhttp://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/\n", "Q: Automatically create monthly Photo Stream albums in the new photos app Back in iPhoto, when using Photo Stream with my iPhone, photos would automatically be put into albums in the main page, one for each month. Eg Dec 2014 Photo Stream followed by another album called Jan 2015 Photo Stream and so on as the months progressed.\nNow in the new Photos app, the albums have been imported across, however as the months continued onwards, the corresponding albums aren't being created.\nIs there any way to get this functionality back in the new Photos app?\nThanks!\n\nA: What was created in iPhoto was an Event for each month's worth of Photo Stream photos. Since the concept of Events no longer exists in Photos, that automatic creation has gone away too.\nYou could manually replace them with Smart Albums. There are a couple of different ways you could approach it:\nCreate a new Smart Album for each month. This can be done ahead of time, with the future months' albums just sitting empty until photos with those dates appear. Settings for this would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Date\"\n\n*\"is in the range\"\n\n*\"5/01/2015\"\n\n*\"5/31/2015\"\n\n\nObviously changing the dates for each month.\nYou could also create one Smart Album that just shows the last month's worth of photos. It wouldn't always align to calendar months, but instead just show the last 28 days worth of photos. Settings for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Date\"\n\n*\"is in the last\"\n\n*\"1\"\n\n*\"months\"\n\n", "Q: Junos Pulse not installing correctly on Yosemite I'm trying to set up Junos Pulse so I can connect to a VPN. I got a dmg with the JuniperSetupClientInstaller.mpkg from the Pulse server site, but when I run the installer, it doesn't seem to have any effect. It shows a \"Successful Install\" message at the end, but nothing seems to have changed. No further windows/dialogs appear, and searching Juniper or Junos doesn't turn up anything new.\nI also tried grabbing the installed application from my old computer (running Mavericks), but I get \"Failed to connect to the Juniper Unified Network Service.\" whenever I try to connect to the VPN.\nDoes anyone have any guidance for either of these approaches? I'm happy to give more information if it would help.\n\nA: The way Juniper does this is a little confusing. Installing the JuniperSetupClientInstaller.mpkg installer from a Junos Pulse VPN server essentially sets up your machine so that the VPN server can then proceed to install Pulse using a Java applet. Here's how the install process works for my shop's Junos Pulse VPN server.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Firefox\n\n*Go to the following site:\nhttps://vpn.server.goes.here\n\n\n*Log in with your VPN credentials.\n\n*If prompted by Firefox, allow the Java applet from the VPN site to run.\n\n*If this is the first time that Junos Pulse has been installed on this Mac, you may be prompted to install the Juniper setup client. If you are not prompted, go to step 6.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Please click here to install setup client link.\n\n*The Juniper setup client will be downloaded in a disk image file.\n\n*Double-click on the downloaded disk image file to get access to the Juniper setup client installer.\n\n*Double-click on the Juniper setup client installer and follow the prompts to run the installation process.\n\n*Once installation of the Juniper setup client has been completed, click on the Once the setup client is installed, please click here to continue link.\n\n\n*When prompted to install Junos Pulse, click the Always button.\n\n*The Junos Pulse installer will download to your Mac.\n\n*Once Junos Pulse has downloaded, the Junos Pulse VPN client will be installed on your Mac.\n\n*Once installation is finished, the Junos Pulse client will automatically connect to the VPN.\nEverything in step #5, where the directions are having you install the Juniper setup client, is where the JuniperSetupClientInstaller.mpkg installer comes in. It's not the actual VPN installer; it's an installer that preps the machine for the later VPN client installation in steps 6 through 9. \nBy itself, the JuniperSetupClientInstaller.mpkg installer will not install the Junos Pulse VPN client.\n\nA: I had this exact same issue.  The problem was that when attempting to uninstall and reinstall Junos Pulse, there were a few files that were not getting deleted in the Library folder.  However, if you use the built in uninstaller for Junos Pulse, it should get rid of everything.  Then, you can reinstall Junos Pulse and everything works as expected.  Best of luck!\n", "Q: Trying to install drivers manually without admin pass Hi I'm trying to install the drivers for xone on my Mackbook Pro running 10.9.5.\nI don't have admin rights and it is in .pkg file form.

Best way to set up (without thunderbolt)? I currently  have a 27' iMac that uses a Samsung 16' monitor as a second display using Mini Display Port to VGA. I also have a 2011 Macbook Pro and was wondering if there was a way to set up this up as a third monitor to the iMac. The MDP is already in use, so what would be my options (if there are any) for connecting a laptop as another monitor? Also note that this monitor does not have thunderbolt, so thats out.\nThanks in advance for help. \n\nA: Take a look at AirDisplay. It supports turning you Mac, Windows, iOS or Android into an external screen.\nThere are several other apps like this such as Screen Recycler, but AirDisplay is the one I currently use. \nAny of these apps will likely work best on a wired ethernet connection. \n\nA: Screen Sharing option in the syst preferences -sharing would be a option, but obviously it will show the same screen.\nCheck the set up at this Apple article https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18696?locale=en_US\n", "Q: Unexpected interruption announcing John F. Kennedy's birthday \n(May 28, 2015, 0900 USPacific/LosAngeles)\nI did not configure this alert. \nWhy was I interrupted for John F. Kennedy's upcoming birthday? \n\nA: This alert does not show up unless you have opted in to iCloud calendars that include that alert.\nYou are most likely subscribed to a US holidays calender.  Open Calenders, then click \"Calenders\" just above the home button.  Select that calender using the \"i\" button on the right and you will be able to turn off alerts for events originating from that calendar.\nIf I guessed incorrectly, select options from the dialog shown and you will be able to determine which calendar has that specific alert and change the settings you selected or potentially unsubscribe from that calendar entirely.\n", "Q: \"open or reload\" html doc from command line?

It is an app that watches your HTML files and can automatically for reload the pages in your browser. LiveReload can also do other things like automatically recompile SASS files to CSS and then reload the browser. \nIn addition to the app at the link above, LiveReload is available on GitHub under a \"Open Community Indie Software License\" which is not quite open source, but does include a dead man clause to convert to MIT if no new binary updates come out for two years. https://github.com/livereload/LiveReload \n\nA: The following command line can be added to your script and it will refresh the Tab that has focus in the frontmost Safari window, (even if the frontmost window only has a single page loaded):\nosascript -e \\\n'tell application \"Safari\" to set URL of current tab of front window to \"file:///foo.html\"'\n\n", "Q: Unable to change volume size on WD My Passport Wireless I have been trying to partion my WD My Passport External harddrive that has already got data on it.

Using a company computer and creating files and whatnot, it always lists the author as being 'pseudonym'•.  Through advanced settings in Users & Groups, I can change the the Account name (ie, the short name) to the name I want, but anywhere I've searched on the internet always states that the Home directory must also be changed to reflect the new Acct. name.  Using the Advanced Settings, is there any problem with having the AccountName and Home directory not being the same?  Can I have my account name 'xXx_dArkSephiroth42_xXx'• and my home directory be 'pseudonym' without any problems?\n• Names changed to protect identity\nEdit: Wanted to highlight using only the Advanced Settings\n\nA: Yes, the full name is unrelated to the short name and you can change the full name without needing to change the short name.\n\nA: The account name and home directory don’t have to match.\n“Users & Groups” doesn’t give fine-grained control like you want.\nUse the dscl utility from the command line. Check the man page carefully; it has a weird way of doing things. For example, you repeatedly use the -create option to set each attribute. Also, you’ll probably use “.” as the datasource, meaning the local machine.\nTo set the home directory, do this:\ndscl . -create /Users/somebody NFSHomeDirectory /Users/somewhere\n\n(note: this is not just for NFS)\nYou’ll have to change the actual directory names separately; dscl will not do this.\nI recommend defining a test user first and playing around with these options until you understand exactly what they’re doing.\n\nA: No.  The answer is no- at least, not by using the advanced settings from Users & Groups.  I've just tried it.  The Account name, ie the 'short name', is mapped to the home directory in such a way that just changing it will cause massive problems on your computer (why they allow you to change one of the two is beyond me).  If you do change it, you will have to log-in using a separate admin account to fix the problems you have made.  If you do not have a separate log-in account, (at least in my case), when you try to log in to your broken account, you will log in as a temporary user called 'System Administrator'.  Using this account, create a new admin account and then log out.  If the new admin account is not visible, it may be necessary to start the machine in safe mode.  Once you log in using the new admin account, you can right-click on your broken account and modify the Advanced settings once again. I suggest setting them back the way they were.  Your system-specific preferences (Finder, Dock, Scroll direction, etc) will probably be reset, but it's a small price to pay for doing something that can really mess up your computer.\n", "Q: Always show language status Is there an small app to always show language status?\nThe ideal app changes the color/shape of cursor depending on current language.\nOr it can be a float icon on top with current language.\nUpdate: Mostly I'm working in full screen mode, usual scenario for me is type something to understand what is my current language. Always show menu bar is not so comfortable for me. \n\nA: You can use ShowyEdge to show indicators for current input langauges.\nhttps://showyedge.pqrs.org/\nIt also works in full screen mode.\n\nA: This can be done by enabling the keyboard shortcut.\n\nNow in full screen mode there will be a pop up when you use the keyboard shortcut (cmd+space) letting you see or change the input language.\n\nThe advantage of this method is you do not have something floating on you full screen all the time, but only when you call for it.\n", "Q: how can i extend my 8gb memory space on iphone 5c Can i use an external USB (like an OTG for androids) on iphone 5c along with an usb adapter(lightning to micro usb port)?\nCan iphones read external USB devices?\n\nA: You can't expand the memory, and there is little in the way of dealing with external USB storage other than importing photos from camera cards. \nThere are several products such as the mophie space pack that have a battery and external storage that is accessible via an app. These are typically cumbersome and fairly limited in how they can be used. Check out reviews of any such products and you will see lots of disappointment. \nFor what these external storage devices do, you are typically better off using iCloud, Dropbox, getsync.com or the like. But this will not solve the problem of not have enough local storage. \n\nA: Have to agree with Lee Joramo, iPhone cannot expand memory unless you choose to delete some content on your iPhone 5C.\n", "Q: Insert GRIDLINES in PowerPoint 2011 Is it possible to insert GRIDLINES (not guidelines) in PowerPoint 2011?

It matches the serial number to a computer name, sets a variable, and then renames the ComputerName, HostName, and LocalHostName with the variable. For reference, the name will be SFO-C2900-MBP\nHere's the script:\n#!/bin/bash \n\necho \"-----Starting-----\"\n\n# Get serial from ioreg and assign\nserial=\"$(ioreg -l | grep IOPlatformSerialNumber | sed -e 's/.*\\\"\\(.*\\)\\\"/\\1/')\" \n\n#Initialize compName to null\ncompName=''\n\n#Loop through CSV looking for a match\nwhile IFS=',' read ser loc; do\n    if [ \"$serial\" == \"$ser\" ]; then\n        compName=$loc\n        echo \"Serial Matched with name: $compName\"\n    fi\ndone < /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/Shared/Configuration/names.csv\n\n#If compName is not null, use scutil to rename. Otherwise user must manually rename\nif [[ -z $compName ]]; then\n    echo \"This computer was not found on the list, you must manually rename it.\"\nelse\n    echo \"Setting Host Name to $compName\"\n    scutil --set HostName $compName\n\n    echo \"Setting Computer Name to $compName\"\n    scutil --set ComputerName $compName\n\n    echo \"Setting Local Host Name to $compName\"\n    scutil --set LocalHostName $compName\n\nfi\n\necho \"-----Finished Renaming-----\"\n\nTwo things are happening from this:\n1) An error is thrown when the script attempts to rename the LocalHostName: SCPreferencesSetLocalHostName() failed: Invalid argument\n2) The Terminal, after quit/reboot/etc, will do the following:\n\nTerminal showing Question Mark over folder, also missing hostname\nSetting these values manually through terminal using scutil --set {def} work fine and restore Terminal to its normal behavior.\nI have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing the LocalHostName lines from the script\n\n*Setting the LocalHostName value to a variable set inside the script and not the CSV file\n\n\nMostly, the script's issue is what it does to Terminal more than anything - I can work around the LocalHostName issue. Weirdly enough, when you run scutil --get {def} on those, Terminal outputs the correct values.\n\nA: In the comments, @MorganR wondered if the code that reads from the CSV file was including a strange character within $compName.\nOne way to test for odd, perhaps non-printable characters is to use od.  It has an obscure name (stands for \"octal dump\"), but it is useful.  It shows the detail of each character in an input stream.\nI usually start by using -c argument, which causes od to output each character detail as \"C-style escaped characters\"... there are other arguments to output as hex, octal (still occasionally useful!), etc.\nFor example (notice the normally invisible \\n is shown):\n$ echo \"foo\" | od -c\n0000000    f   o   o  \\n                                                \n0000004\n\nSo, if that makes sense, my suggestion is: try adding the line echo $compName | od -c to the script after the \"loop through the CSV\" section.\nIn the comments, the issue has turned out to be an unexpected \\r character.  I think the likely cause for this is that the CSV file has CRLF (=\\r\\n) line endings (was it created on a Windows system perhaps?), but the read ser loc command in the script is expecting just LF (=\\n). \n\nA: I have completed the same with below string :\ncompName=${loc::9};\nwhich actually removes 9th character of the stored variable .\n", "Q: Does anyone have a Thunderbolt Display connected to a desktop PC?

The file is 725 pages and 1.73 GB large. It is mostly text but there are a few images per page. Now that the book is scanned in, OCR'd (SearchScan exact), and Bookmarked (all done via Adobe Acrobat Pro XI), I can read the file digitally. I am a big fan of annotating (specifically highlighting) my readings in Preview.\nSo I open up the file in Preview.app to begin my studies. It scrolls a little slow and lags a bit, but overall I can work with the file given (to be fair, the size is large). However, saving the file after any highlighting is a nightmare.\nWhen I highlight a word, and then hit CMD+S, Preview \"saves\" the file in less than a second. However if I immediately hit CMD+S a second time (which is the only way to actually save the file, I believe, because only after the second Save does the \"Edited\" marker at the top of the file go away), I instantly get a spinning beach ball of death. The ball spins for several minutes (15+). After the Save is completed and the \"Edited\" tag disappears, I \"X\" out of the file with the red X, and the beach ball process occurs for a second time. It is almost as if Preview is re-saving the entire document, instead of just the one page which I annotated.\nI have spent many hours trying to figure out how to fix this. I have encoded and re-encoded the PDF in many different manners. I \"Optimized\" the PDF in Adobe Acrobat Pro XI using JBIP and then with ZIP. I \"Exported\" the file out of Preview itself, with the Quartz filter. I reduced the quality of the PDF so that it was only 750 MB large. I repaired disk permissions. None of these various methods significantly decreased the beach ball time of the Preview saving process.\nI'm sure I could break up the textbook into smaller files, but this is an inconvenience. I could also use a different app to annotate the PDF but I've always liked Preview up until now and use it consistently for all of my note-taking needs. In fact I have a 300 page textbook PDF that is 150 MB and Preview handles the file well; it only takes maybe 10 seconds to save and the file does not lag.\nI can't really decrease the quality (ie size) of the PDF because the text would be hard to read.\nI realize it's a large PDF, but I don't think I'm asking too much of Preview for 2015. I would really appreciate help with this matter as this saving issue is putting me behind.\nMy computer:\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013), 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, 2.4 GHz Intel Core i7, NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB, Yosemite 10.10.3\nEdit 05/30/15: I think something is wrong with the Preview.app, not my PDF file. I have a scanned textbook PDF (530 pages, 330 MB) that I've reference periodically over the past year and it used to be a lot zippier. Nowadays the book takes about 30 seconds to save. Not a very long time, but longer than I remember...\n\nA: What I ended up doing was simply break the textbook chapters into individual PDF files. Not the ideal solution, but at least the saving process for highlighting is relatively quick with chapter files.\n", "Q: How to update apps outside the US? I bought my macbook pro in HK and I live in China.\nAs a new user, I don't understand why I can't update my apps and I see this message:\n\"Your Apple ID is not valid for use in the Chinese Store. To create a new Apple ID, you must switch to the U.S. Store.\"\nWhat am I supposed to do? Apple is really weird with these \"border limits\" in a global world. Please help!\nThanks\n\nA: I don't have any particular experience with overseas connectivity but I wonder if getting a VPN service specifically from Hong Kong with an exit there would fix the issue. This might allow the HK Apple store to see your MacBook as local to HK rather than where you actually are and connect you to the HK Apple store.

If not, you need one.  This thread has a lot of information about how to do that: How to setup Gmail SMTP server for OSX Mail with 2-step-verification and App-specific password?\nIf that is not the problem, it may be that the Yosemite upgrade broke it.

I am trying to buy an app which runs on 10.10 only, from a computer that has 10.9 installed. The App Store does not like it:\n\nTranslation: Your purchase could not be completed. OmniOutliner could not be installed […], as it requires […] 10.10 or newer\nIn other words: I would like to just perform the buying process, not install the application on my computer (Which is not compatible – yet. Long story). Any help is greatly appreciated.\nNota bene: I can not buy from Omnigroup directly, or use a gift card. Another long story. \n\nA: I know this is a fringe case. I can report that as of Summer of 2015, buying an app for a newer OS version from an older version is not possible. I solved the issue by installing 10.10 on a different partition, and bought the app from there. \n", "Q: how to browse photos in mac folder via iPhone Can one use the iPhone to browse photos and videos that reside in folders on a internet connected mac?\nI have recently decided to not use library based photo managers - after Apple decided to give up on Aperture. Uploading to online photo sites is time consuming. And Dropbox costs $100 a year - kind of expensive just for photos.\nAnd when I have an internet connected, always on, Mac Mini, then wondering why I cannot use it to serve up my photos and videos in a manner similar to what Dropbox can do.\nThanks in advance for sharing your ideas!\n\nA: The app store has some pretty good options for file browsing apps.  I use FileBrowser for example.  FileBrowser description.\n\nFileBrowser is the original and best file manager and viewer for iOS.\n  FileBrowser can view, copy, move, upload, download, stream, and manage\n  files between computers, servers, NAS drives and cloud storage in any\n  direction. You don’t need to install any other software. FileBrowser\n  will scan and locate computers on your network and connect in seconds\n  and will connect to cloud storage quickly too.\n\nHere's a link to FileBrowsers support guide to setting up \"External Access\", since thats what i'm taking your after with references to DropBox.  This takes some setup but then you can access your files on the Mac Mini without limitations of being on the same network.  \nIn a nutshell you are going to either open a port in your network firewall or setup a vpn to be able to get on the same network as your MacMini when outside of your home.\n", "Q: time machine - replace backup disk My backup drive (named seagate) kept getting the error- not enough space - although the size of the backup is the same as the HD. I am at 60% capacity on my HD.\nThe error continued even though I erased my backup to restart the process (as well as deleting unnecessary files from my HD, and limiting what was being backed up)\nIn setting up Time Machine again, it's asking if I want to replace the back up disk \"Macintosh HD\" or back up to both disks. I just want to use seagate, but am now concerned somehow it will erase my HD. Is that concern invalid? It would certainly be counterproductive to lose what I'm trying to save\n\nA: From your description, it sounds like you have an external hard drive (Seagate brand), which you have been using for your Time Machine backup. You're also saying that the capacity of the external hard drive is the same as your Mac.\nAs a general guideline, you want the Time Machine's hard drive to be about 1.5x the capacity of the Mac's hard drive. The reason being is that Time Machine stores progressive changes to files, such that you could literally restore one version of a file from a week ago, even though the file had been backed up several times over the week.\nWith respect to setting up Time Machine again, it sounds like you have a Time Machine backup on the external hard drive, and you're being prompted to restore. If this is confusing to you, then you could simply format the external hard drive, and then designate it for your Time Machine backup.\nFor all things related to Time Machine backups, and troubleshooting issues related to that, take a look at Pondini's Guides and Tips for Time Machine.\n\nA: Are you certain that there is enough space remaining, even after all you've done? Look at what Time Machine reports as its backup size by clicking \"Options\" in Time Machine preferences, then compare it to free space remaining on your backup drive.\nRemoving a backup disk doesn't do anything to the data. You can even re-add it later if you want to.\n", "Q: Selective contacts on iphone I've synced my google (gmail) contacts to my iphone5, but i'd like to have some contacts not show on my phone.  Is there a way to select either on the phone or on gmail which contacts to show on my phone?\n\nA: iOS will show all contacts under \"My contacts\" on Google / Gmail.\nIf you move contacts out of that group, they will not show on your iPhone.  \nTo do that, go to http://gmail.com and login with your credentials.\nClick on Mailon the top left and select Contacts.\n\nThere you can see which contacts are on which groups and move the contacts you'd like to hide from iOS (and OS X, by the way) out of \"My contacts\".\nThis has even helped me when deleting contacts by mistake, as they don't dissapear from your Google account, they just get moved to \"Other contacts\".\nYou can group them if you like but those groups will not be available or selectable for display / hide on your iPhone on the standard configuration. When you have multiple contacts lists from different accounts, a Groups option appears on the top left menu on the Contacts app, and Google Apps may show Address Book and Global Address Book as options, but the latter will take you to an empty list designed to search from the organization list of addresses. Or –as of right now on my iPhone after showing me those options– it may show you only one option per account (All (name-of-the-account)), to toggle on or off.\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if it's a perfect answer, but could you place the contacts into 2 different groups, and then only display the group you want to see (I think they will both be on the phone, but just not shown).\nAt the top left of the \"contacts\" screen on the phone, you can select Groups, and turn them on and off there.\n\nA: Jaime Santa Cruz's answer should work perfectly.  I just want to add that if you did all that but still see unwanted contacts, you may have to force iOS to refresh the Contacts.  To do so, goto your iPhone's Settings and select Mail , Contacts, Calendars. Select Gmail, uncheck Contacts and then recheck Contacts.  When you go back to the Contacts app, it should work.\n", "Q: Shared Calendars not available in Outlook 2011 Shared Calendars is not available in my Navigation Pane.\nI am trying to add colleagues calendars.

With only 128 GB I try to manage the disk space carefully. But now I find there is only 10 GB left. About This Mac → Storage shows that photos take up 61 GB of this. \nDrilling down 52.7 GB of this is in the folder ~/Library/Application\\ Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub which I understood to be Photo Stream. It shows in a very large number of folders, each containing a single jpg file.\nBut if I pull out the images by using the Finder window searching for \"image\" and then selecting from kind \"image\" (I understand the standard way to pull out Photo Stream) the resultant file is only 5 GB large\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is this folder showing nearly 53 GB when Photo Stream is only 5 GB? \n\n*What constitutes the other 58 GB?\n\n*How can I identify them and delete those I don't need to free up some much-needed disk space?\n\n\nA: The sub folder contains all the legacy photos from iCloud and iPhoto and normally should have photos and videos. \nWith 10.10 and the new Photos app, everything appears to be stored in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.cloudphotosd/ and not in Application Support once you open the new Photos app and allow it to migrate things.\nIf you're in that situation (open the Photos app once and letting it set up a library and choosing which Photos to store locally), you should be able to confirm that nothing in iLifeAssetManagement is needed anymore and safely delete it after making a backup offline just in case we don't know all the tricks Apple has pulled.\nBe sure to open iPhoto one last time and see if you need any of the photos there. If not, consider deleting that app and then converting all the iPhoto albums into Photos app albums and deleting the iPhoto Libraries once you have also an archival copy of these Libraries for \"just in case\" needs stored offline.\n", "Q: In Inbox by Gmail, where is the new \"Swipe to delete\" setting?

It's fairly well configured, but I'm sure that can improve response for a reasonable purchase, which bring me to this inquiry.\nThe idea of using a 1tb SSD drive as a Boot drive to boost my Mac's overall response is exciting because this thing is a dog, even on Yosemite. What I don't know is if that will speed things up in general (and hopefully Photoshop) better than maxing my RAM.\nMy deeper Question here is which option would get me the most speed for the $ by:\n1. maxing Ram to 32gb for ~$450\n2. swap current SATA3 WD Caviar boot drive for an SSD (about same $)\n3. add an SSD to my second Optical bay (about same $)\n4. add an SSD to my second fast PCIe slot? (possibly more $$ than it's worth?)\nI currently work a lot on 400mb+ Photoshop files. I keep the files on an internal 7200rpm SATA2 RAID-0, and use a 10,000rpm SATA3 disc as a scratch space.\nDo you think I would see a stronger performance gain not only in finder ops, but also in Photoshop with the SSD vs double the RAM? Hard to know where my response time bottlenecks are in this box.\nWould an SSD on a fast-lane PCIcard be better than on native internal bus to drive bays?\nAny wisdom on options I've not considered would be deeply appreciated as I'm trying to save this box as I don't have the funds to buy a cylinder MPro or fast iMac.\nMy setup stats:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running Yosemite, + background apps like Sophos, Fonts mgmt app, TimeMachine, DropBox, etc. \n\n*RAM: All slots used with 2gb Apple sticks.  \n\n*Boot drive: 1tb 7.2k rpm WD Caviar SATA3/64cache containing only OS system, iTunes, etc. Only half space used. Kept optimized with DiskWarrior. \n\n*Internal 2tb 7.2k rpm Seagate Barracuda SATA2 Raid-0 for the files. Kept less than 70% full and regularly optimized. \n\n*150gb 10k rpm WD Velociraptor SATA3 as a dedicated scratch disk for PS.\n\n\nthank you!  ~ dave\n\nA: Maxing out RAM can only situationally improve your performance. If your computer isn't ever using a ton of swap space (less than a gig), adding more RAM isn't likely to help much. The SSD will almost certainly improve the performance of your computer. Yosemite really is designed for SSDs. It seems to do a ton more arbitrary reads/writes to disk during the course of its operation than earlier versions did, so it will be dog-slow on a HDD.\nAs for the SSD on PCI, that is definitely the better solution. SATA 2 (which the 2008 Mac Pro comes with) is far too slow for the faster SSDs. There's little point in hooking up a modern SSD to that. PCI should be able to handle it.\n", "Q: Revoking and requesting a new distribution certificate in apple dev center I'm trying update our iOS app through itunes connect.

This question may at first glance seem to be a duplicate but I am asking for an update and clarification to an unsolved problem.\nAfter extensively scanning the web, it seems that the consensus is that even if one were to force bootcamp in a macbook pro 2010 model (with optical dvd drive removed) to recognize usb, there remains the problem with EFI vs GPT booting. See the previous AskDifferent thread: Mac Mini 2010: DualBoot (BootCamp) OSX Mavericks + Windows 8.1\nHas this community come up with a solution?\n\nA: Apple iMac and MacBook Pro models did not have UEFI firmware and the ability to boot Windows installers from USB flash drives until at least the 2012 model year.\nYour firmware does not have the ability to boot from a USB flash drive Windows installer. You should install Windows using your DVD drive. If you no longer have a DVD drive, you may still be able to install using the Windows 8 iso file. This have been done successfully using Windows 7 on a 2010 15\" macbook pro (MBP6,1). If you wish, I could update the procedure for Windows 8. (Or are you installing 8.1?). Anyway, go here for more information.\nTo install directly using the GPT partitioning table is only recommended if your computer has a UEFI. Your model does not. Most people who succeeded usually have a problems with one or more drives not working properly. There is no advantage in trying. Installing using the MBR partitioning table will work without any problems.\nYou don't have to use BootCamp. Most who don,'t, want something different than the default; such as an extra NTFS or ExFat partition. The procedure depends on what you have in mind.\nUpdated Procedure for Installing Windows 8.1 Using VirtualBox\nThe original steps are posted here.\nSteps 1-14. No change\nSteps 15-17. Substitute Windows 8.1 for Windows 7.\nStep 18. No change\nStep 19. Images slightly different, but not worth updating.\nStep 20. The rest the virtual machine installation will be repeated again after booting Windows on the physical machine. For most questions, you can use the default answers. Use the provided answers below when the following windows first appear. When asked a second time, you can provide your own answers.\n(Hint: For a better view, click on the image or open in a new window.)\nWhen the following window appears, enter a name for the computer. You will enter this same name later. I used the name Shark. Choose any name you like.\n\nWhen the window below appears, choose Customize.\n\nVirtualBox creates a virtual Public network for your virtual machine. Therefore I would click on \"No\" in the window shown below.\n\nTo be safe, I would not let any updates download or install until after the Boot Camp Support Software (the drivers) is installed. Therefore, when the window below appears, I would choose \"Don't set up Windows Update (not recommended)\".\n\nWhen the window below appears, choose \"Create a new account\".\n\nSelect \"Sign in without a Microsoft account\", when the window below appears.\n\nEnter a temporary user name, password and password hint, in the window shown below. You can delete or disable this account later.\n\nStep 21. Replace\n\nFrom the Start Menu, select \"Computer\" to open a window containing the hard disk drives and devices with removable storage.\n\nwith\n\nRight click on the Start Menu and select \"File Explorer\" to open a window containing the devices and drives.\n\nThe first image will be slightly different. Replace\n\nSelect \"Start Menu→All Programs→Accessories\", then right click on \"Command Prompt\" and select \"Run as administrator\", as shown in the image below.\n\nwith\n\nRight click on the Start Menu and select \"Command Prompt (Admin)\".\n\nDisregard the second image. The Desktop shown in the third image will be different.\nStep 22. Replace Windows Explorer with File Explorer.\nStep 23. Same instructions. Replace image with the following. This step takes a long time to complete.\n\nStep 24-26. No changes.\n\nA: You do not need to use BootCamp for Windows 8 at all. Macs come with GPT-partitioned disks by default and Windows 8 in EFI mode now supports GPT disks; just create a partition with Disk Utility, boot Windows 8 in EFI mode and it will be able to format that partition, install on it and boot from it.\nThe whole point of BootCamp is to fake MBR-partitioning while keeping the actual disk in GPT, because old versions of Windows only supported MBR and did not recognize GPT. Since Windows 8, that problem is gone. Simply creating a partition and installing is exactly how it should work; BootCamp is an ugly workaround which only exists because Microsoft wasn't very quick in supporting the newest technologies. BootCamp is not needed anymore.\nThe only problem that remains is that you have to download drivers for your Mac hardware from Apple website from under OS X, put them onto USB and install from under Windows.\nI did not try with 15\" macbook specifically, but I currently have Windows 8.1 installed on Late-2012 iMac, and I have never used BootCamp for that, just Disk Utility and bootable Windows 8.1 USB drive.\n(Special note: this will not work with Fusion drives because Windows cant recognize Apple CoreStorage technology and no drivers yet exist).\n", "Q: Is it still possible to order the reinstall disk for a MacBook 2007? I want to order the reinstall disk for MacBook 2007.\n\nA: I think what you mean is the restore disk that came with the computer. If so your best bet is to just call the Apple Store and speak to a sales rep. Those kind of things are generally unavailable on the web site or stores but are available through Apple itself.\nApple Contact info here.\n", "Q: Can I connect more than one external monitor with only one thunderbolt port?

Is it possible to connect a second external monitor? If so, how?\n\nA: thunderbolt dock will do it.  get one that adds dvi, hdmi or passthrough thunderbolt.\nmy caldigit does hdmi + passthrough thunderbolt so i can get 2 displays on there.\n\nA: Although I am not using multiple monitors on my new Macbook Pro 15\" (2015), I purchased CalDigit's ThunderStation 2 model. That product connected to your iMac will provide support for thunderbolt / mini displayport passthrough as well as an HDMI port.  So, you should be able to connect 2 external monitors to your iMac via this device. => http://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-2-dock-TS2/index.asp\n", "Q: How to enable the sidebar in finder? All out of a sudden, the sidebar in \"Finder\" is gone. The weird thing is that the \"Show Sidebar\" entry of the View menu is disabled/grayed out, so the sidebar can't be enabled again. Do you have any ideas how to fix this issue?\nBtw, restarting did not change anything.\nEdit: Happens on OSX Yosemite/10.10.3\n\nA: For me, the solution is that I need first (by Apple mis-logic) to hit: \n\"View / Show Toolbar\" (⌥⌘T); \n…then \"View / Show Sidebar\" (⌥⌘S) becomes ungreyed. \n\nA: Carefully move the pointer to the left side of the finder window border till the cursor changes to arrow pointing to the right.\n↦\nHold and Drag to the right.\nIf that did not work you need to restore the finders preferences.\nIn terminal run \nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\n\nand \nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist \n\nRestart.\n", "Q: My Mac's hostname keeps adding a \"-2\" to the end If my Mac's computer name (in the Sharing prefs) is \"Node\" normally, once in a while when using the Terminal, I can see it's magically changed itself:\nNode-2:~ $\n\nFor some reason it thinks its own name is taken and adds \"-2\" to the end. I have to go into the Sharings prefs and change it back. Why would this be happening and how do I stop it?\n\nA: This is a known bug with the discoveryd process on 10.10 Yosemite. Recent rumors is that it will be replaced by its predecessor, mDNSresponder, come 10.10.4 to help alleviate network issues. Although the actual cause is unknown, it has been said that it is related (at least in part) to improper name resolution in DNS when the computer wakes from sleep. It sees itself as a duplicate on the network, and as such it appends the suffix to the title.\nWhile there are some \"fixes\" YMMV - It's probably best to just keep renaming it the way you do, and then wait for the next release of OSX to come out and fix it so you don't sacrifice any functionality like Wake on LAN.\nSource\n\nA: That rename comes from any one other device on the network that remembered the IP address of your mac before it went to sleep or renewed its DHCP lease.\nYou would want to power down all Apple TV and Apple airport/time capsule devices and then restart your router (if an Airport device isn't doing the routing) at that point, the iOS and Mac devices should let you rename things again slightly more permanently than if you feel like you're battling an automatic useless machine.\nIt's a pain, and Apple had what it thought was a fix in 10.10.2 and 10.10.3 - we'll see if more patches help...\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*My Mac mini's computer name keeps changing when it resumes from sleep\n\n*Prompt changed in my terminal\n\nA: As other answers mention, this is a bug in Yosemite and will hopefully be gone when 10.10.4 releases.

I was given an old retired Xserve 2008 model. This model cannot officially run Mac OS X beyond Lion Server. I have tried the tricks to get later OS X versions to boot on it, and while it works, the latest versions of OS X Server do not support this hardware - for example, most of the remote management features (power/fan/CPU speed/disk health/etc) do not work, as Apple considers this unsupported hardware.\nI would like to run Windows 2012 Server R2 natively on this hardware. I know that installing into a VM would be an option, but I am not licensed for versions of Fusion old enough to run on Lion, and Virtualbox has been a mixed bag for me. I also would probably lose some performance here... And the issue still stands that I'm running a severely outdated underlying OS that Apple isn't going to issue security updates for.\nNow I know that running Windows natively on here won't give me that server management on Apple's side, but there's plenty of Windows tools that can do essentially the same thing provided the hardware is detectable under Windows.\nI know that Xserves do not have the BIOS emulation layer that most Macs use for Boot Camp support, but I was wondering if it is possible to use EFI Booting to boot Windows 2012. \nI've tried so far to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a LiveUSB Linux device from a recovery distro which boots via EFI. This works. I am able to boot into Linux. The older graphics hardware seems finicky, but it does seem to run. This shows that there's enough EFI here to boot a non-Apple OS.\n\n*Create a Windows 2012 R2 boot DVD for installation. This completely fails - holding down Option does not show the DVD at all in the boot options.\n\n*Create a Windows 2012 R2 boot USB device using the NTFS file system. This does not work - guessing it's because Apple's EFI can't read NTFS (as most can't). The problem is that the 2012 R2 installation .WIM file is larger than 4GB, and while there's ways to do split WIM files (SWM), Microsoft explicitly states you can't install from one of these.\n\n*Try creating a standard Windows 8 x64 boot USB device on FAT32. This should theoretically work since the Windows 8 install image is only about 3GB. This does show up in the boot options, but when it's selected, a black screen occurs and no further movement occurs.\nIt would seem that either I'm missing something, or that somehow this EFI implementation specifically refuses to boot Windows. \nMost of the posts around the Internet chastise the poster for even considering this option (\"Why would you want to do this! Get a PC server for God's sake!\"). While they would have a point for new systems, this box is still very serviceable with its dual quad Xeons and 16GB of RAM and SAS drives - and Apple has only dropped support for it due to video card support. \nMy next step would be to try two things: to install Windows to a SATA drive using an EFI compliant system in order to get a drive that's EFI compliant that boots Windows and shove that in the Xserve to see if it'll boot it; and also to install the EFI GRUB loader onto the Windows install flash drive and see if it can coax the Windows loader into running. But before I go through all that... is this even possible? Or has Apple done something to block this from even being possible using native EFI?\nI'm already aware that there may be driver issues due to lack of Boot Camp support, but from what I've read, the Xserve is more or less a Mac Pro in a 1U rack case, so I'd expect manually extracting the drivers from the Boot Camp distribution that works on the Mac Pro would likely yield many of the necessary drivers which could be installed by hand.\n\nEdit: This appears to be related to the video card. A Linux installation I tried to make to the raw hardware resulted in a black screen as well. After poking around for a while, I figured out that there seems to be an issue when the Linux install tries to flip the video card into a more \"native\" video mode. I got Linux to run by disabling all of its video stuff, and basically letting the EFI video driver maintain control. \nI'm not sure exactly what could be causing it, but perhaps it has something to do with the machine thinking there's multiple displays attached (when there actually isn't), or that the Apple video card is using some completely non-standard video modes...\nSo my guess is that the Windows installer may in fact actually be booting, but that I just can't see it because the display isn't presenting it...\nMy next step would be to try preinstalling the OS onto a SATA Disk as I explained above, however this still wouldn't be a solution, as I would not have any video output in order to install the network card drivers...!\nI could definitely install Linux + VMware, or even ESX server, but I would lose some of the raw hardware level optimizations available - network card, SAS disk hot swapping, etc. at the OS level. This is why I still would preferably want to run Windows Server natively on the machine...\n\nA: Just a thought here, but if you can boot Linux, why not install ESX 5.5 (it's free to use in base form) and then just one VM, your Windows Server.\nESX has a very low overhead and you should get most of the oomph you need out of Server 2008r2.\nThe only question that remains is, \"will ESX 5.5 install on an XServe?\"\n", "Q: Will my photos still be saved on icloud if I turn off 'find my iphone' from the icloud? Will I still be able to access my photos, contacts, etc by logging into my icloud if I turn off 'find my iphone'?\n\nA: Yes. There is no impact from turning off \"Find my iPhone\" besides you losing the ability to track your phone should it be misplaced/lost/stolen/etc. To prevent syncing of all items, you would need to turn off iCloud altogether on your phone (or its individual services).\n", "Q: 8GB model iPhone 4S is only showing 5.4GB capacity (4.2GB available) It used to say 8GB capacity in the General > About Settings menu. Now it only says 5.4. I've done a \"restore as new\" but it's still showing the same.\nHelp?\n\n\nA: The operating system (OS: iOS 8.x) is using up space as well and you're not able to use this space. The phone comes with 8GB, yes, but minus the space used for the OS. I think Apple got into problems when they advertised with 8GB/16GB etc. while people could only effectively use that space MINUS the space used by the OS.\n", "Q: Can the Apple Watch app be side loaded and used on other iOS devices? I know the official requirement to use the Apple Watch is an iPhone 5 or newer running iOS 8.2+, but I'm interested to know if it is possible to sync it to an older iPhone, iPod, or an iPad by side loading the Apple Watch app or any hacks. According to Bluetooth SIG's site the iPhone 4s, iPad (Air, Mini, 3rd & 4th gen), and iPod touch (5th) are Bluetooth Smart Ready which means they are compatible with both standard and low energy Bluetooth protocols. Since the Apple Watch only works with Bluetooth LE and these devices also support LE it seems to be just a software limitation.\nI would try side loading the 'Apple Watch' app myself to a jailbroken iOS device however I am not able to find a .app/.ipa for it.\nI have already read the \"Can you use the Apple Watch with an iPod touch?\" post but I believe this question is different enough to justify a new thread.\n\nA: Apple Watch uses Bluetooth to communicate with iPhone. iPhone 5 is the first device that had Bluetooth LE support, which is used in cases where you want a low-energy-usage always-on connection, so it would follow that is the earliest model that can actually communicate with Apple Watch.\nWhile Apple Watch can, in some circumstances, use Wi-Fi to communicate with iPhone, it has to be a network that iPhone was connected to while previously paired with Apple Watch over Bluetooth. Since devices prior to iPhone 5 likely cannot establish a Bluetooth connection to Apple Watch, no Wi-Fi network would ever be trusted by Apple Watch to use for communication with iPhone.\n", "Q: Weird storage declaration from my computer With no good reason I had a look at my computer's storage going on the apple and About this Mac. Here is the display:\n\nThe pink bar doesn't make much sense. It obviously does not represent the 80.67GB of free storage. Two sections correspond to pink; \"Photos\" and \"Backups\". I obviously don't have 140.76TB of backups. And probably not on this computer that has only 320GB of storage.\nWhat is going on here?\n\nA: I would ignore it. That graph is particularly unreliable and it's unclear sometimes, even when it's showing storage that is possible within the computer, what exactly it is counting. If you want a better overview of your storage, use something like DaisyDisk.\n\nA: tubedogg is likely right but I would be tempted to boot into recovery mode and run Disk Utility then repair disk and fix permissions. It might be the symptom of a disk issue that could be easily fixed.\n", "Q: How to recover Mail, Calendar and Contact after Mavericks to Mountain Lion downgrade? I want to downgrade from Mavericks to ML. If I do this, how can I recover my emails, calendar and contacts after the downgrade?\n\nA: Mail isn't stored on your Mac but on a server of your provider and will backup automatically after sining in again in Mail-App on ML   \nExport all your contacts by selecting all -> file -> export -> vCard\nimport the vCard on ML in Contacts file -> import  \nFor Calender, you can select single colored event-collections and export them\nfile -> export-> export  \nAfter that copy all files you now made to an USB/external drive and use them again on ML\nUsually all these things should also be stored in the cloud, so they won't be lost when downgrading, best check this before downgrading on iCloud.com \n", "Q: How did my deleted iCloud photos end up in the new Photos app? so i've just upgraded to OS X Yosemite, which comes with the new Photos app. and i am scared! the minute i opened the app, it prompted me to log in to the iCloud and started downloading some old photos, which i have deleted from My Photo Stream looong time ago. for example, i had some pictures from 2012 christmas party which have been in My Photo Stream over TWO YEARS ago, but now they're resting safely on an external HDD. so the question is - how did they end up showing in the Photos app, if I:\na) have definitely deleted them over TWO YEARS ago from My Photo Stream\nb) backed them up to an iPhoto Library on an external HDD, which I DID NOT CONNECT at any time to my computer\nalso one more thing worth noting - when i login to the http://icloud.com and go to Photos, I can only see like maybe 5 recently taken pictures - no sign of the old photos, as expected, because, you know, i deleted them TWO YEARS AGO.\nthe question is: where did those photos come from and why are they showing up in my Photos app? i want to identify the source for those pictures, so I can remove them once and for all.\nhonestly, this is scary. i am all for cloud-based storage, but only if i have full control over it, whereas it seems Apple is backing up my s*** without my consent.\nany advice will be greatly appreciated.\nthanks,\nJohn\n\nA: Note that iCloud.com/#photos is not the same thing as My Photo Stream, and photos that were only in My Photo Stream will not appear in iCloud.com/#photos. (Unless you turn on iCloud Photo Library and sync a Mac Photos library that contains the photos downloaded from My Photo Stream, which would then be uploaded to iCloud Photo Library.) So even though the photos were still in My Photo Stream, it would be expected that they would not appear on iCloud.com.\nDeleting from My Photo Stream was, at least for a while, pretty buggy. And, at least when the feature was first made available (remember deleting was not available when My Photo Stream itself launched), \"deleting\" photos from it meant they were only erased from the device you were using at that moment and not actually removed from the stream.\nAlso note the following from Apple:\n\nAfter you delete a photo [from My Photo Stream], you might still see it on your iOS devices if it's more than 30 days old and you have fewer than 1000 photos in My Photo Stream.\n\n", "Q: Is there a video player for OS X that will float to top and avoid the cursor? Is there a video app that can float on top and avoid the cursor? The problem with VLC is that I use the \"Float on Top\" feature while VLC takes up 1/4 of the screen. However sometimes I would like the access the menus below VLV, and therein lies the problem. I don't want to constantly move VLC just to access the menus below it. \nIs there a feature or app that can move the video player out of the way from the cursor and return to its' original position afterwards?\n\nA: You can use afloat. This lets you configure VLC to float on top and be somewhat transparent when you move your mouse over it, as well as allowing clicks to pass through to the application behind.\n\nA: There is a player called MPlayerX (mplayerx.org) that allows you to do just that. It floats on top when playing, but does not float when it is paused. I have no idea why other players STILL do not have this function. I mean it is paused, I do not need to be staring at the still image, and if I did want to keep staring at it I can just keep it on top anyways.\nI know the question was asked a while ago, but I found this while trying to see if there was another player, or a way to make VLC behave in this manner, and it seems no one gave a good suggestion.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: What is the last macbook or macbook pro model that had a replaceable battery and hdd? I was thinking of buying a used macbook or macbook pro and plan to replace the battery and HDD\n\nA: As far as I am aware you can replace the battery and HDD/SSD on most MacBook Pro models. Have a look at the manuals on iFixit. \nMacBook Pro 13\" Retina Display Mid 2014:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can replace the battery like this\n\n*And the SSD like this.\n\n\nMacBook Pro 13\" Unibody Mid 2012:\n\n\n*\n\n*I think the last HDD MacBook Pro. No retina display, but you can replace the optical drive and use a 2nd HDD/SSD instead.\n\n\nA: Current-production MBP and MBA (Air) laptops have replaceable batteries and storage. \nIf you really mean \"user-replaceable\" then we have to go back to the  MacBook (no pro) models of 2008. It's pretty easy to identify - flip it over, if there is a very obvious latch (aluminum) or coin-slot release (plastic) then you can change the battery in 30 seconds with no tools and the drive in 5 minutes with a common screwdriver.\nNewer models have the battery completely inside the case. You will need 2-3 different types of screwdrivers, some rather specific (but quite cheap) electronics tools and about 30 minutes to swap out the battery and/or storage. Longer if that model has the battery glued to the case.\nThe 2015 Macbook (the super-thin one) does not have user-replaceable anything. The battery is glued to the case, and the storage is soldered to the logic card (it's too small to be called a \"board\") so you are stuck with whatever you ordered. But unlikely it will need anything for 5+ years.\n", "Q: How can I make Siri use non apple apps? Is there a general way extend Siri on iOS 8 to use other apps?\nFor instance, I am not using the apple E-Mail app but \"myMail\". I'd like to make Siri use this app when telling her to write an e-mail? \nBy extension, can non-apple apps for sending instant messages, listening to music be plugged into Siri?\n\nA: This is currently not possible. Siri is only able to use Apple's standard apps, sadly.\n\nA: Siri only provides full integration with first-party apps and services on iOS.\nHowever, should certain apps use public APIs which integrate with iOS, such as media apps which utilise the media playback API (usually noticeable by being able to pause/play from Control Center) then Siri will be able to perform simple tasks such as pause/play/next.\nThis still won't let you pick specific media by name as you can with the first-party Music app, but Siri does provide some integration with apps outside those created by Apple.\n", "Q: files are being downloaded with .html suffix Every time I download a file from my school site, it gets .html suffix.\nFor example, if I download a file called file.docx from my school site through the safari, it is saved in my downloads directory as file.docx.html.\nThis issue happens just at my school website and not at any other website whatsoever. Additionally it happens just through Safari and not through Chrome or any other browser.\nHow can I resolve this?\n\nA: This is outside of your control - the headers being sent by the school's web server determine what file type Safari thinks it is, and therefore appends the extension it thinks is appropriate.

Will I find this M.2 slot even on the mechanical-only version?\nI'm referring to both 1.4 and 2.6 GHz versions.\nThanks.\n\nA: I think no, as reported here in this guide for replacing the SSD only the SSD or Fusion Drive version has the M.2 slot:\n\nUse this guide to replace the SSD stick in an SSD only, or Fusion Drive model of the Mac Mini Late 2014.\n\nBy the way you can easily figure out this opening the enclosure on the bottom following the guide linked before. \n\nA: People are saying that all 2014 Mini have the connector for PCIe, but the HD-only models are missing the flex cable that has the SSD slot on the other end.

Not just the ones for that day or by searching with an alphabet letter.\n\nA: This is really a bit tricky on iOS. If you are in Calender view, there are three icons on the right side. The third from the right is the list icon. But there are two types of that list icon: one only shows three lines, the other shows two lines and a square.\nThe mode you are talking about must be the one with the two lines and the square. So you see the calender view on top (\"the square\") and a list of events for that (\"the two lines\").\nPress this button so it is not selected any longer. Now you see the calender view without the list. Now press the \"Today\" button in the lower left corner. The view will switch to show you the timeline of the day, and also the third icon from the right switched to the one with the three lines. Pressing this \"three lines\" button will show up the event list you are searching for.\n\nA: I agree this is non obvious and takes a few try\nClick on the menu icon so it is not highlighted (the third from left in the top row)\nThen keep hitting today at the bottom left hand corner until the calendar disappears.\nYou then have a list of events\n\nA: Completely non-intuitive, and it works differently on iPad vs iPhone. \nOn iPhone, from any view, click on the magnifying glass. Type in a '?'. This will show all events on all your calendars in an agenda format.\nOn iPad, select the magnifying glass. iPad by default will list all events in an agenda view, flowing under the Search box. The '?' trick still works, but there really is no need for it.\n", "Q: How to link multiple key events in AppleScript?

When I move the mouse cursor to top right corner, the cursor will become waiting circle. \n\nWhat can cause this, how to check and fix the issue?\n\nA: This can be caused by missing/corrupt menu items that hook into the SystemUIServer such as first-party menu items or apps like iStat Menus which integrate into the SystemUIServer (you can usually distinguish these because you can ⌘-drag them between other apps' menu bar items.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the log in Console.app (/Applications/Utilities/), looking for any apps which you know have menu bar items present, or any references to SystemUIServer.\n\n*Check Activity Monitor for any apps that show Not Responding for their process.\n\n*Try restarting SystemUIServer and watching to see if you can notice the hanging app:\nkillall -HUP SystemUIServer\n\n\n*You can use the Accessibility Inspector, accessible from Xcode → Open Developer Tool → Accessibility Inspector.\nHover over the item and the pane may show you enough information for you to determine what it is.

And none of my googling has found a fix to my problem.   Specifically, I get these errors when I try the various proposed solutions I've found so far: \n>sudo chmod -N Pictures\nchmod: Failed to clear ACL on file Pictures: Operation not supported\n>sudo chown jdthorpe Pictures\nchown: Pictures: Operation not permitted\n\nAnd if I highlight the file in Finder, click cmd-I to view the file info and try and modify the Sharing and Permissions, I get a error stating:\n\nThe operation cant be completed because you don't have the necessary permission.\n\nFinally, DiskUtil won't reach the back-up folders since they're on a network drive.\nIn case it's useful, calling ls -lash yields this entry:\n0 drwxrw-r--@ 1 jdthorpe  staff   264B Apr 16  2011 Pictures\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated!\nUPDATE:\nThe network drive in question is a Western Digital My Book Live.  This share that the data were stored on was set to serve media and the directories I'm unable to access contained media files.  Disabling serve media did not fix this issue, but I can't help noticing that I do have access to backups of a different OSX machine stored on the on the same WD drive that were placed in a share that did not have serve media enabled. The mystery continues...\n\nA: As it turns out, trying to set the permissions  via the command line does not work on NAS drives, as pointed out in the response to this question.    The mystery user (\"daapd\") that has ownership of the Pictures on the WD My Book LIve (MBL) is the name of the streaming service that streams the pictures, video, and  music on some shares of the MBL -- and this \"user\" appears to have exclusive read & write access to directories containing music, pictures and video on shares that are set to allow streaming.   \nI came across a solution stating \"Just copy the contents to a windows computer\" which works because the extended unix permissions do not prevent windows machines from accessing the data.  \nMY SOLUTION:\nSince the extended *nix permissions prevent any user not named \"daapd\" to access those files, I created a user on my Mac named \"daapd\" and voilà, I could accsss the Pictures folder.  I then created a new share on my MBL with streaming disabled, and I copied the contents from the old share to the new share and I now have access to my data. \n", "Q: Apple App Store (install and get) loop, how to fix it? Apple App Store is stuck in a loop, when you press \"get\" you get \"install\", and when you press \"install\" you get \"get\" again, and so on with infinity loop, trying to download a free or commercial app — how do I make it stop?\n\nA: I figured out that the problem came from fingerprint (Touch ID), as when I turned their options off, it worked like charm.\nJust turn off those settings under \"Touch ID & Passcode\" section:\n1. iPhone Unlock.\n2. iTunes & App Store.\n\nA: I just confirmed from Apple Support Center that it cannot install apps even free ones if there is not a credit card on file. \nSo, if not, add the credit info and shipping address to your apple id in advance. \n\nA: I had the exact same issue on Mac App store when I tried to download a free app. It was looping between Get and Install. I tried all the above mentioned suggestions but what worked for me was signing out from my App store and logging back in.\n\nA: I had the same Install/Get loop problem. After lots of digging and resetting basically everything, I came upon my solution: it was the fake address I submitted when creating my Apple ID (literally just strings of random letters). I wasn't able to change it in the original ID, so I just made a new one where the zip code matched the state. That did the trick!\n\nA: I had this issue when using a test account from the Apple Developer program.  Once I changed back to my real account, I was able to install apps again.

Is this possible?\n\nA: In watchOS 3.2, Apple added Theater Mode, accessed by swiping up from the Watch Face and tapping the bottom-left icon.\n\nTheater Mode silences the WATCH and prevents the screen from lighting up on wrist-raise or when receiving notifications. Taptic feedback will still be triggered.\nYou can combine Theater Mode and Do Not Disturb to silence Taptic feedback, as well. Alarms will still ring as normal.\n\nA: In WatchOS 7 Apple introduced the Sleep mode natively: https://support.apple.com/fi-fi/guide/watch/apd830528336/watchos .\nThe sleep mode differs from Theater by a few ways:\n\n*\n\n*Tapping does wake the screen now\n\n*Opt-in sleep tracking\n\n*Digital and more dimmed clock\n\n\nA: Yes. Theater mode is the perfect option for it.\nIt silences your Apple Watch's screen, leaving the display off unless you intentionally tap the screen or press one of the watch's buttons.\nTheater Mode: On will display at the top of the screen in Control Center. On your watch face, you'll also see a theater mask in the top center of the screen to indicate that you currently have Theater Mode activated.\nFor more info refer this link.\nhttps://www.imore.com/how-to-use-theater-mode-apple-watch\n", "Q: How to Recover a gone OSX (mavericks) on MacBookPro? I shutdown my computer for some reasons with power button (cold shutdown). Unfortunately, my OS i.e.,mavericksis gone at the moment and I have no backup from the Data and settings of that Hard drive partition.\n  I have the mavericks installation DVD, and tried to repair the disk with Disk Utility but it didn't work. getting the following message:  \n\nDisk utility stopped repairing 'Macintosh HD`, Disk utility cant\n  repair the disk, back up as many of your files.....'\n\nI have 2 partitions on my hard drive including Macintosh HD which my OS was installed there, and Mac Store that contains my own data.\nI tried to reinstall and recover the OS on the same drive i.e,Macintosh HD in order to keep the settings (password, usernames,) and information of my hard drive (However,later I should do the clean install).

It sometimes goes to maximum speed but only for a couple of seconds and then goes back to normal. Without doing any heavy processing. The hardware test tells me there's an error:\n4SNS/1/40000001:VH1R-0.000\n\nWhat could that be? I found nothing on the internet.\n\nA: CNet has an article on the codes returned by the diagnostic test. http://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-invoke-and-interpret-the-apple-hardware-tests/\nAccording to that VH... means voltage on the hard disk.\nAt a big guess you might have a dodgy connection to your hard-disk. If its intermittent then the voltage may drop, triggering the safety feature of the fans running at max speed.\n\nA: The 4SNS error with a V after the ':' indicates an error with a voltage sensor somewhere in the machine. This is an obvious hardware problem that may or may not be serious. The only symptom you experience is hearing the fan turn on briefly, but other problems may be occurring in the circuitry that may be deleterious to the health of your Mac.

Although I am using Photos.app, and iPhoto has now gone, the events are still referred to as iPhoto Events.  \nIt is my belief that the lack of \"iPhoto\" as an app anywhere on my system means that I am running wholly on \"Photos\" despite the events being referred to as iPhoto Events. \nAm I correct in this belief?\n\nA: Photos doesn't use Events. Though it imports old ones from iPhoto, it considers them now to be Albums &  won't create new Events of its own.\nTo delete one, enable the sidebar - View menu or  Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   S \nRight click the 'event' & select Delete Album.\nThis does not delete the photos in it, just the 'container' event.\nInstalling Photos shouldn't necessarily delete iPhoto. I still have both on my machines, though I did download Photos specifically, as opposed to it being delivered as part of an update.

Via Settings/Safari/Saved Passwords/ it is possible to view all saved passwords by simply entering the 4 digit passcode on ones iPhone.\nIs it possible to still be able to use Keychain passwords and autofill, but prevent access by the 4 digit code (e.g. requiring the full Keychain/iCloud password), so that someone who knows your phone code is not able to access all of your internet passwords in plain text?\nEDIT: it is possible to set a different 4 digit code as the \"Keychain pin\" via turning on Settings/iCloud/Keychain/Advanced/\"Approve with Security Code\", but the phone 4 digit code is still used for accessing the saved Safari passwords as above... It would be great if there was a way to always require the \"Keychain pin\" instead.\nRELATED: the analogous problem on Mac OS X: How to prevent Safari saved passwords being seen with Mac password?.\n\nA: I hate to reference unreleased software, but quite frankly the solution may be for you to enroll now in the iOS 9 public beta or simply wait for it's official Fall release. iOS 9 (at least in its current state) gives the option to set a custom alphanumeric password in place of the familiar 4-digit pin. \nSo, if you have hardware with touch ID capability you could use that for your everyday login and reserve a more complex passcode (even the same as your iCloud one, like you mention) for protecting your keychain in case of theft, etc.\n\nA: Simply use an alphanumeric passcode.\n", "Q: Spring loaded folder settings missing in Yosemite My spring loaded folder settings are missing from the Finder prefs in Yosemite.\n\nWhat might be the cause of this and how do I get all my options back?\nFYI, I do have XtraFinder 0.25.4 installed but the option didn't move to the prefs there.\n\nA: It appears that these settings have been removed from the Finder preferences window.\n\n\n*\n\n*The slider is now located in System Preferences → Accessibility → Mouse & Trackpad\n\n\n*You can change the spring-loaded delay by writing the setting manually:\ndefaults write -g com.apple.springing.delay -float 1.0 && killall -HUP Finder\n\nReplace 1.0 with the delay in seconds before springing.\n", "Q: MBA mid 2013 trackpad not clicking Should the top part of MBA mid 2013 (MD711) trackpad click? I recently noticed that mine doesn't. I don't know if it's an issue just with mine.\n\nA: This is how the trackpad is designed.

Although that may be because when I bought my Mac, it came with Yosemite, so I'm not exactly an oldie, but I digress.\nSome apps STILL don't support fullscreen mode, such as MathMagic. I find this quite irritating, and so I downloaded Maximizer, which was built for Lion, but which I thought would work in Yosemite. However, it doesn't. MathMagic still can't enter fullscreen. I have looked all over the internet for a solution, but almost all I've seen are for OSX Lion. What are my other options? \nThanks in advance!\nEDIT: I gave MathMagic as an example only because it was the software that got me started researching on how to do this, but there are so many others. Adobe software is the de facto example of this. Adobe Flash, Photoshop, Illustrator, everything - all of them don't support Yosemite fullscreen. So, I was looking for more immediate options of making fullscreen work. \n\nA: Apps must be developed using Apple's APIs to use the modern full-screen mode.\nInfoLogic, Inc., the developer of MathMagic, must incorporate these APIs into their next release to use the mechanism Apple has provided.

(I know that I could easily plug each screen into its own Thunderbolt/DisplayPort. But I need to use one Thunderbolt/DisplayPort for my Ethernet adapter, so I only have one left.)\nSo the setup I'm trying to run looks like the following:\nMacBook --(from mDP to DP)--> Screen 1 --(from DP to mDP)--> Screen 2\n\nHowever, whenever I connect the cables like this, I only receive the same image on both screens, i.e. the image is mirrored to both screens.\nI don't understand why this is the case. If I connect the same setup to a Windows machine, it is working fine. While Googling I found some articles which say that \"a Mac running Windows will daisy chain monitors\".\nBoth screens support DisplayPort 1.2 as well as MST (\"DisplayPort 1.2 added support for Multi-Stream Transport (MST), enabling multiple monitors to be used via a single DisplayPort connector.\") and I enabled Display Port 1.2 on both screens within the menu.\nSo, as Windows machines and a MacBook running Windows support this setup, I concluded that it has something to do with OS X running. I tried to download the newest drivers for my graphic card form Nvidia. However, I learned that Apple provides the drivers, not Nvidia (“Nvidia drivers are provided by Apple and they are updated with every OS X maintenance update.”).\nSo I think that Apple is intentionally restricting the usage of Display Port 1.2 with non-Apple screens by limiting this function within the drivers.\n\nCan this be true?\nDoes anybody have a solution for this problem, or know what to do?\nI tried to find open source drivers for my graphic card and my MacBook which would enable this function, or maybe some hacked drivers, but had no luck yet.\n\nUpdate 1: 3 June 2015\nAfter Googling again for some hours, I decided to test the statement (link above) that a MacBook running Windows is able to daisychain. I installed Windows 8.1 on my MacBook via Bootcamp.\nWhen running Windows 8.1 with the actual Nvidia drivers, daisychaining multiple displays through one Thunderbolt port is possible.\nSo I conclude that Apple is intentionally limiting the capabilities of OS X, to force customers to buy their Thunderbolt displays if they want functionality that should be possible with normal displays, and breaking the official standards.\nI contacted the Apple Support again, and met a very competent and helpful supporter, who deep-dived into my problem. He escalated the problem to the European technology department of Apple, questioning why daisychaining display port monitors is not possible on OS X.\nI am still waiting for a response from the department, but this can take up to 5 days, according to the supporter.\nIf I get any answer, I'll post it here.\n\nUpdate 2: 6 June 2015\nToday my Apple support rep gave me a call to inform me that he received a response from the European technology department of Apple. However, the department only referred to a support article of Apple and quoted the following \"[...]  as each Thunderbolt port can support one Mini DisplayPort display.\" Therefore, they could only speculate why daisychaining does not work but decided to not do so as it wouldn't help.\nMy support then told that this answer is not very satisfying and asked for further help.\nIt seems like this daisychaining problem is either not known at Apple and therefore not solved (maybe we can make Apple pay attention by spamming the developers with the form mentioned below), or Apple does not want to solve the problem in order to force customers to buy the more expensive Apple Thunderbolt Display.\n\nI am keeping this thread up to date for other people searching the web for the same problem.\nIf you are experiencing the same problem, then please fill out Apple's feedback form and tell the developers to change the macOS behaviour regarding daisychaining.\n\nA: This is answered at Apple Macbook Dual Monitor MST already.\nApple is not \"intentionally limiting\" anything. They simply didn't add MST support to OS X because their hardware doesn't need it. The physical Mini DisplayPort connector on your Mac can operate in two modes, one is DisplayPort itself. In this mode, you can connect a single 4K 60 Hz monitor to your Mac. Or, you can use it in  Thunderbolt mode where the displays use the Thunderbolt bus which has two DisplayPort signals multiplexed into the stream and each monitor gets one signal out -- but it's DP 1.1a so 4K 30 Hz or Full HD 60 Hz.\n\nA: Apple does not support Display Port daisy chaining. \nUsing Thunderbolt screens, this would work, and because the Apple screen is a Thunderbolt screen, that works. The fact that Windows supports DP daisy chaining, does not mean that Apple does this intentionally to force users to buy their monitor. \nSo... Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\nI wouldn't even call this stupidity, just ignorance, or the simple fact that nobody at Apple was aware of this situation and didn't test for it, or they did test for it and decided it wasn't worth the money.\n", "Q: Early 90s Mac freeware anti-virus program I'm trying to find information about a popular early 90s Macintosh freeware anti-virus program.

The only way I can use it is to use the previous Apple ID and password. Is there any way I can change the Apple ID to a different new account? \n\nA: \nI have forgotten my ID and password\n\nWe are well into the 21st century - your ID and password are as essential to modern life as your date of birth and Social Insurance Number. \"I forgot my ____\" is no longer acceptable.\nIf you are the original purchaser of the iPad, go to any Apple store with the device and the receipt. They can remove the activation locks. If you did not set it up originally, contact the person who did.

But I would like to buy the latest mac 12\" 1.3GHz Dual-Core Intel Core M. But I need Visual Studios 2013 the requirements are 1.6 GHz or faster processor.\nCan this be install in VM and work? Thank you in advance.\n\nA: I guess you are talking about the latest MacBook and not Air or Pro?  \nVS will probably install and maybe even start, but the MacBook(without suffix) was never invented to be for developers, indeed it isn't even meant to complete any complicated tasks, but only Web and Office, which means that you won't be able to properly work with it.  \nI can only recommend buying a MacBook Pro which even starts cheaper at 1099$ with a 2.5 Ghz Dual-Core processor.\n\nA: The only way to really know for your workload is to buy it and try it with your projects. In the U.S. and EU, there's a 14 day return policy which should be enough time to test it out. It's got a fast SSD and w/ 8GB of RAM it might be good enough. It has a turbo-burst speed of 2.6Ghz so there are a lot of performance variables in play.\n", "Q: Set program as default for all openable files on mac Is there a way to set a program as default, for all file types it can open?

I'm searching for a custom method to limit access to our mac. Parental controls allow you to limit time by school nights and weekend time chunks through system preferences. However, I want more options for the limiting. For example, on Mondays I want access available from 2pm to 5pm and then again from 8pm to 10pm limited to 2 hours total login time. Tuesdays may get different time ranges and total access time.\nIt seems like I should be able to do this by modifying the com.apple.familycontrols.timelimits.v2.plist file. But it gets rewritten back to the settings I have previously set through system preferences.\nI don't want to use a 3rd party software for this. It seems that I should be able to accomplish what I want by manipulating settings \"under the hood\". Any ideas on how I might do this?\n\nA: I would use the Automator application and set it there with Calendar events.\nAll you have to do is crate different events (shut down times and dates).\nExample:\n\n", "Q: Install application on external SSD and load from external SSD to RAM? I want to install some applications on an external SSD attached via a USB 3.0 interface.\nAs I know from the apple site, I can move my iTunes and photo library to an external drive. (support apple link)\nI own the 128 GB version of the MacBook Pro series, so I would like to outsource some disk space-intensive applications on an external SSD like the libraries, too.\nCan I install applications on an external drive?\nIf it is possible to install applications on an external SSD, will the OS load the data from there to the internal SSD to process or is it going to load the data directly to the RAM ?\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes. Some applications won't allow you to install them on drives that don't contain an OS X installation, however there are often ways to do it manually post-installation if that is the configuration you wish.\n\n*Some applications will indeed do some writing to the internal SSD, since presumably that's where OS X is installed. The Library folders for example contain configuration settings and application data for most of the applications on your computer. Although you can trick an application into writing to your external SSD by moving its data/configuration directory onto your external drive, then making a symbolic link back to your Library folder. It's not guaranteed to work, but it generally works just fine.\n\n*An application whose data is entirely contained on the external SSD won't have any reason to access the internal one. The data would load directly into RAM, never once touching the internal SSD.\n\nA: *\n\n*1) Yes. Some applications may require that there be an operating system present on the the external drive, however. \n\n*2/3) Entirely depend upon whether you are booting from the external SSD (in which case an OS must be installed). If so, then all R/W operations will occur on the external drive. No I/O activity will occur on the internal drive unless you subsequently choose to mount it. \n", "Q: How can I see the list of all open folders in the finder in the Open/Save dialog?

The issue here is - can you save a translation in the Google Translate App to a phrasebook (on, say, an iPhone) and then pick up the same translation on an iPad (without having to enter and retranslate the expression).\nMy experience is that you cannot. Each device keeps it’s own individual phrasebook (and ‘never the twain shall meet’).\nThe only way (that I can think of) to do this is to have a user login for the app. Then whenever you log onto Google Translate, your saved translations (from your Phrasebook) become available as they are associated with you user id.\n\nA: Yes.\nApp Store - Google Translate\nSave translations in a phrasebook\n\nAdd a phrasebook entry\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Translate app .  \n  \n*Translate the word or phrase you want to add.  \n  \n*Next to the translation, touch the star ☆.  \n  \n  \n  View or delete entries \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Translate app .\n  \n*At the bottom of the page, touch the star ☆.\n  \n*To delete a translation from your phrasebook, touch the star ☆.\n  \n\n", "Q: Best practices to migrate from a single shared iTunes account to family sharing Since iOS 4, my family is equiped with multiple iOS devices. I used the same iTunes account on all devices to share :\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications\n\n*Photos\n\n*Notes\n\n*Musics\n\n*Data (game progression)\n\n\nWith iOS 8 Apple introduced family sharing. Firstly I didn't see any advantage in this new functionality. \nBut with this post, I understand that 1 account per physical person is the new golden rule.\nSo what are the best practices to migrate from a single shared iTunes account to family sharing without loosing anything ?\nSome data (game progression) aren't shared accross all devices, how can I be sure that my daughter will not loose her data when she will use her newest iTunes account ?\n\nA: Personally I would create subsequent accounts for other family members, then you can use your current account as the \"parent\" or \"leader\" account and then add the new accounts to the family. \nYou are still using your original account so you're guaranteed not to loose anything, the others should also have access to the content you choose to share with other family members. \n", "Q: Moving Macbook Snow Leopard drive to a Macbook Pro that had Yosemite installed: kernel panic! My wife has a mid 2006 macbook that has been upgraded to snow leopard. I have a mid 2008 macbook pro that has been upgraded to Yosemite. I now want to give my macbook pro to my wife, and thought I could just swap in the drive from her macbook into the MBP (and then subsequently upgrade her to Yosemite).  Swapping results in a kernel panic on the MBP; having done some reading, I suspect the problem is that somewhere along the way the MBP's firmware was upgraded such that it can no longer run snow leopard.\nSince I can't (apparently) swap the drive in, what is the best way to move my wife's entire drive contents (i.e. apps, data, settings, whatever else) over to the MBP under Yosemite with as little fuss as possible? I have a cloned version of her macbook snow leopard drive available if that helps matters...\n\nA: Thanks to those who responded to my question, but here's what I ended up doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed my wife's macbook/Snow Leopard drive in a caddy and attached it to another mac machine as an external drive\n\n*Downloaded the OS X Yosemite installer from the App Store and ran it with the external drive as the target\n\n*Attached the newly updated external drive to my Macbook Pro as an external drive and booted up off of it (booted up into startup manger mode - press and hold the option key after the powerup tone - and then selected the external drive as the bootup disk\n\n*removed the drive from the caddy and installed into the MBP\n\n\nI'm not sure the third step is really necessary. \nThis all resulted in a Macbook Pro running Yosemite with all my wife's data/apps/etc in place with little fuss - my original goal :-)\n(If anyone else is following this procedure, a reminder to effectively backup your data before starting! In my case that meant using Carbon Copy Cloner to an external drive.)\n\nA: There is a method called Target Disk mode. Probably the best for your case, and you only need to move her home folder that contains all her info. Keep in mind that when moving apps they have to be Yosemite compatible.\nThis way you can just leave the original Yosemite drive in your MacBook pro and only move files of interest to you.\nApple article how to do that: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH10725?locale=en_US\n\nA: You will be able to transfer the data from one mac to another use Migration Assistant. Target disk mode isn't the best solution for a full migration like this. If you can back up the drive with your content, wipe it, reinstall the OS and start Migration Assistant to transfer over her data, that would be one approach. You could also buy a cheap drive to swap your drive out with, reinstall the OS and migrate the data over the same way. Either way, Migration Assistant is going to be your friend through this process. Follow the on-screen instructions, and it should be a painless process.

It comes out randomly. Initially, I thought it's a new feature that binds the iPad session on Chrome to the one in Mac.\nThe position is very odd (left side of the Finder). And whenever I click it, it merely opens a random commercial site. That's when I felt suspicious.\nIs this a new feature that simply needs to be disabled, or is this a malicious program? Any idea how to remove this?\n\n\nA: That is Handoff and a natural feature when OS X and iOS devices are signed into the same iCloud account. This works if you have iOS 8+ or OS X 10.10.x Yosemite. If you have a supported application then you will be able to open it on your Mac right where you left off on your iOS device.\nLooks like you was running Chrome on your iPad at the time.\nIf you wish to disable Handoff on a Mac, open 'System Preferences' and select 'General'.

The system starts it when it detects a potential problem or an actual problem - so you've likely got something out of adjustment or problematic installed.\nIt's from Apple and generally is more like a fire suppression system than something that starts the fire. To use that tool to find the initial cause of the CPU usage you'll need a few tools and some basic orientation.\nFirst, open up Console.app and look for the Show Log List/Hide Log List button. Press it to expose the User and System Diagnostics Reports.\nYou can monitor the actual reasons why Report Crash is running here. If there are a lot of events, you can right click a name and Reveal in Finder ⌘ - R and delete or watch the log files more easily in Finder.\nOnce you have a feel for what the diagnostics look like on that Mac, a second console window can watch /var/log/system.log as you work to see what happened right before the Report Crash fires up.\n\nNow for your specific crash. Locationd can be cancelled by turning off all network access. I would turn off Bluetooth if you don't need it and turn off WiFi and disconnect any network cables from the Mac. \nThen I'd shut it down and restart. Look at the time when you log back in and watch for more crashes. Once the system is stable - turn on one item (Bluetooth or Wifi or connect one network cable) and then wait for a bit.\nYou can even poke locationd after the reboot by opening the Maps app and requesting your location. It should warn you about needing things turned on, and ignore those for testing.\n\nA: According to the man page (man ReportCrash):\n\nlaunchtl can be used to disable and re-enable crash reporting.  To disable crash reporting:\n      launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ReportCrash.plist\n      sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ReportCrash.Root.plist\n\nTo re-enable crash reporting:\n      launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ReportCrash.plist\n      sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ReportCrash.Root.plist\n\n\n\nA: The locationd file was corrupted. \nAfter trying to access my privacy settings in safe mode and normal mode (which did not work, it crashed) and after a restart and PRAM reset (which did not help neither) I installed the combo update from here https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1804?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US and that worked very well :)\n\nA: I was googling for a solution. I tried reinstalling OSX. I tried some clean up using the Onyx utility.\nIn the Console application where you see that something is crashing and restarting and crashing again, you can see some file path in the reports.\nSo this solution I found somewhere. You can see this path in the Console application when the problem is occurring, so it make sense and works. I also restarted that locationd service by running this:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locationd.plist\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locationd.plist\n\nOnly deleting /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n00000sm00006d fixed this problem in my osx installation.\n", "Q: USB 3 HDD on Apple Thunderbolt Display I have an Apple Thunderbolt display and really love it - only that the USB ports are only USB 2!\nI have read this question, but is there any new development on connecting a USB 3 drive to a thunderbolt port on the Apple Thunderbolt monitor?\nI could buy an external thunderbolt hdd instead, but the difference in price between USB 3 and thunderbolt drives is quite substantial. Also, I did not find any affordable thunderbolt housings.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I have a USB/eSATA 3 4-bay hard drive enclosure hooked up to my Mac mini (late 2012) via the Kanex KTU10 Thunderbolt to eSATA + USB 3.0 Adapter. It's currently connected to the eSATA port on the enclosure, but the KTU10 supports USB 3 as well. It's been hooked up since mid-March and I have had no problems with it.\n", "Q: Privacy aspects of Safari extensions I'm wondering about privacy aspects of Safari extensions, or which pieces of information active extensions can obtain about my web browsing activities. Should I expect that an extension will generally be able to collect information about everything I'm doing in Safari, or are there any restrictions on what extensions can access? The question is it possible to disable Safari extensions when using Private browsing? seems to indicate that there may be privacy issues when extensions are enabled.\nMore specifically, I'm interested in the Google Scholar extension that installs a button in the toolbar. Should I expect that this extension communicates information to Google only when I'm actually clicking the button, or can it communicate more?\n\nA: In general, extensions should only be installed from trusted sources. See the popup that appears when you attempt to install an extension below. Unlike Chrome's extension API, Safari does not require that extensions request specific rights from the browser that the user must in turn grant when installing the extension, or specify a set of domains that the extension is allowed to operate on.\nThe developer of a Safari extension must, however, be part of Apple's Developer Program, and must obtain a signed security certificate from Apple for an extension to load in a user's browser. Unlike iOS or Mac App Store apps, though, this does not mean that Apple reviews extensions that are not hosted in the Safari Extension Gallery on apple.com.\nThe second part of your question is out of scope for this site, as it requires interpretation of Google's TOS and Privacy Policy (as linked from the page you linked).\n\n\nA: According to this, so i think the extensions cannot read what you're browsing.\n\nA side benefit to Content Blockers being implemented as an App\n  Extension is that they perform their intended function without knowing\n  (or recording) what content the user is actually browsing, eliminating\n  privacy concerns. \nSafari App Extension Content Blockers can't see URLs of the pages or\n  other resources the user has requested, because they only define rules\n  of what Safari should block. WebKit also does not record which\n  blocking rules have been executed on specific URLs.\n\n", "Q: Macbook SSD Formatting Problem I just got my Macbook here, and I got a USB with Yosemite 10.10.\nI opened up the Macbook, took out the old one, and put the SSD inside.\nMy SSD fits perfectly (Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250GB).\nThen I plug the USB thumb drive in, and then boot the computer up, and holding the ALT (OPTION) key down. Then I came into the drives that I can boot from. I couldn't see my SSD there, then I took the thumb drive(8GB), and then I began to install Yosemite, after I choose the language, I need to choose where I need to install Yosemite. The hard drive, didn't show up there either.\nI get in Disk Utility and find out that my hard drive, isn't formatted, I just want to format it to Mac OS Extended Journaled, I chose it, and clicked erase and when I did that, I got this error:\n\nErasing the disk failed, Erasing the disk failed with error:\nFormatting the file system failed.\n\nI translated the error from Danish, so it could be worded differently on the English version of Disk Utility.\nNote: The Mac is not new, the SSD is new and never used.\n\nA: You have to format the SSD without using it as your primary disk. \nIf you're able to run Mac with the old disk, connect the SSD via external enclosure and format it (or make a clone of the running HDD). \nAfter this swap the disks, boot form installer and install OS on SSD. \n", "Q: MBP Retina 13\", very contrast images stays on the screen I have a weird issue with my MBP, not that it causes any discomfort or troubles, just want to make sure it isn't something serious.\nI don't even know how to exactly describe the problem, but only can say that when I open some white image and then switch to gray app, I can clearly see shadows of previous image.\nI have MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)\nI uploaded video on YouTube which shows the issue. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBzi9Qzlxew\n\nA: Sounds like the Ghosting-Effece, even though I can't watch the Video because it says it´s private.\nThis effect can happen, when your screen shows the same image over an longer period. It is visible, when you switch to a blank image.\nThis problem is covered by your warranty from apple. The will most likely change the display for a new one.\n", "Q: How to open and read particular files on iOS (.xpt .por)? What apps on iOS can open .xpt and .por files? I think they are called binary or stata/sas files in general? How do you open them on iOS? Is that not possible?\n\nA: .xpt files are SAS XPORT files; .por files are ascii data files created by SPSS.\nStatsGuru for SPSS is a iOS app:\n\nStats Guru is a tool to help social scientists determine the correct\n  statistical test for their data. The tool then provides a walk-through\n  for each test, using SPSS Version 21.\n\nSAS Mobile BI is an iOS app.\n\nSAS® Mobile BI empowers decision makers with business reports and\n  dashboards anywhere, anytime! SAS Mobile BI, part of the SAS® Visual\n  Analytics solution, enables you to access and interact with reports\n  and report elements such as graphs, tables, KPIs, and data grids.\n\n", "Q: Archive Utility password Right when I opened Archive Utility for the first time, it asked me for a password for \"activated.info\". What password is it talking about and what would I put? I've never used it before so I've never set up a password.\n\nA: It's possible to put passwords on archives as a protection measure.\nThe password here would be a user-chosen password when compressing the original content to the zipped archive that you're trying to open.\nGo back to the source where you downloaded the file and see if there's a password listed somewhere.\n", "Q: How to run diagnostics on iPhone? My iPhone currently has me stumped. It's an iPhone 6 running the latest iOS. I have a Mac running Yosemite and the latest iTunes. I can't figure out what's wrong, so a diagnostic method would be great. I've no access to a genius bar etc. \nInitially the wifi indicator stayed grey. Then there seemed to be weird charging issues. Then it had moments of shutting off (once it even came with a blue screen,) but this may be down to the charging. \nThis all happened within a few hours. \nThen it went to charging with only the apple logo. I assumed I was screwed. \nA few days later (I was on vacation when all this went down,) I turned it on and it appeared to be working as normal, albeit with the wifi greyed. It allowed me to make a backup, which was nice.\nI reset the network connections - no joy. \nI reset the other settings - no joy. \nI had to wait until later to completely restore the phone and by that time I was left with an unresponsive phone never making it beyond the apple logo. \nI connected to itunes and got nothing until putting it into DFU mode. iTunes picked it up and I tried a restore. Initially I got error 4013, then tried again and got 4005. I keep getting 4005 and can't get the phone off the \"connect to iTunes\" screen. \nReally don't know where my phone is at, so a diagnostics method would be great. \n\nA: The diagnostic function on an iphone does not appear to have a user-trigged capability.\nApple can invoke this remotely by pushing a Profile to your device, assuming that it can both boot up and is able to join a network.\nThe profile causes a new item to appear in\nSettings ➔ Privacy ➔ Analytics\nWhen you tap on this the tests run and immediately send the results back to a support agent and I presume they‘re recorded in a database somewhere too.\n", "Q: WiFi keeps dropping requiring restart (confirmed non-hardware issue) I have taken my late 2011 MacBook Pro to the 'Genius Bar' and they said that this was NOT a hardware issue as they ran the diagnostic and found no problems. This is why I am posting this despite there being many similar questions, as all of them were resolved by replacing the hardware. The Apple 'Genius' then said the WiFi was \"probably\" dropping because I was running Mountain Lion and Yosemite had lots of connectivity updates. I am now running Yosemite 10.10.3 but the problem persists.\nThe Problem\nI'll be connected to any given WiFi connection (indicating this is not a router or channel problem) and everything will work fine. Within a period of time – normally ranging from a few minutes to an hour – I will try to load a web page and see its loading status say 'resolving host' (Chrome v43).\nWhen the WiFi dies, the only (temporary) solution is to 'forget' the network, make WiFi service inactive and then remove the service altogether, before rebooting and re-activating it. When the WiFi dies, the signal icon shows a full strength connection and in 'System Preferences > Network' the button says 'Turn WiFi off' as though it hasn't realised yet.\nSometimes, when I boot back up, clicking on the WiFi icon shows a message stating 'No hardware detected'. I have to restart once or even a few times before this is fixed.\nAttempted Solutions\n\n\n*\n\n*Called Apple support who talked me through deleting lots of different preference files\n\n*Took to Apple Genius who said it was 100% not a hardware isse as this would be picked up in diagnostics\n\n*Updated from Mountain Lion to Yosemite\n\n*Updated all other software\n\n*Reset PRAM / SMC\n\n\n** Log **\n01/06/2015 23:29:22.298 discoveryd[78]: Basic DNSResolver UDNS Send(): UDP Sendto() failed to DNSNameServer 194.168.8.100 Port 53 errno 65, fd 56, ErrLogCount 50 ResolverIntf:5\n01/06/2015 23:29:58.329 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.CoreRAID[845]) Endpoint has been activated through legacy launch(3) APIs.

Thanks.\n\nA: I recently had similar issues with Macbook air keep dropping wifi and constantly searching wifi. I knew it was not because of my wifi router because my android device had stable connection. Upon trying different tricks such as restarting network etc, none seems to work. I finally came up with a temporary fix. I opened the network preference on Mac and ran the network diagnosis, it says my network is working fine. Then I close the network preference. And Viola, the network is now working just fine. It seems to me that some file or setting is corrupted in the network registry for some reason, and after running diagnosis, the OS overwrite and fix the corrupted file or setting until next time it is corrupted again. Hope that helps.\n\nA: Finally I go to taking a look at your log. (even if it is very short one), the more info the better.\nSo, we have following to fix: Not all of it is your WiFi problem related.\n\n*\n\n*In Application folder find and open Font Book app. In there use the Restore system fonts.\n\n\n*Your DNS server is having problems.- Open Syst Pref- Network - DNS. Add Google DNS to it as 8.8.8.8, delete others (like this one DNSNameServer 194.168.8.100).\n\n\n*Lets check your Host file.\nIn Finder use the Go- go to folder and paste following /private/etc/hosts\nThat will show you the Hosts file in the new window. Open that file and compare your results to this:\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.\n##\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n::1             localhost \nfe80::1%lo0 localhost\n\nYou should NOT have anything more or less in that file.\nU P D A T E\nAfter reading your Log file from 04/06/2015 on https://gist.github.com/anonymous/85efce69325f2ea487a7\n\n*\n\n*Please stop that Google Chrome He in your Activity monitor (kill it). Do not use Google Chrome browser for a while to test without it.\n\n\n*You still have DNS server problems. You should remove all DNS servers in the syst pref Networks, and only leave the 8.8.8.8.\n\n\n*I suggest to use the Namebench app that will evaluate and suggest the best (fastest) DNS server for your location. I used it and now my surfing is much faster.\n\n\n*You should then run the Ping Google.com (in Terminal app located in your utility folder) let it finish and you shall see no packets loss, and ping times of 20-50 ms\n\n\n*Now lets set up a continuous ping that would keep your connection alive.\nThe following will send a signal every 60 seconds to Google server.Just let it run the whole day, then stop it using ctrl+c-\nIn terminal type ping -i 60 google.es Again your Ping time should be something like time=30.201 ms. I just did it from California to Spain.\nFinal comment: Apple has acknowledged that there is a problem with the discoveryd process, and has fixed it in the new (beta) release of the Yosemite 10.10.4. Let hope for the best and wait for it to become public.\n", "Q: Setting up gmail in Mavericks - A connection error occurred I am trying to setup gmail on a clean install of Mavericks 10.9.5. The Gmail settings like enabling IMAP etc are all set.\nSo now I am ready to add a new account in my mac, by going in System Preferences -> Internet Accounts and click to add a new Google Account. \nEntering the email address and password and clicking the ok button, I am getting immediately an error message in red: \"A connection error occurred\".\nI am trying the same directly in Mail app, still the same.\nThere is no 2step verification and all security settings in Google account are setup so the connection should work.

Visit: https://accounts.google.com/displayunlockcaptcha from the machine you are trying to connect, log in to your account and follow the steps/instructions.\n - Try the Other Account Option and even configure manually the gmail account in mail app if it can't auto-discover settings.\n", "Q: Work Mac and home PC with same Apple ID causing problems I used my personal Apple ID on a new work computer and now am having issues.  Bookmarked Favorites set on the work Mac appear on my home PC and vice versa.  iCloud photos available on the work Mac aren't accessible at home.  Personal Messages received on my iPhone pop up on my work computer.

I'm importing photos from my camera using Photos application, but how can I optimize these photos. \nMy camera does 5.5MB big JPEG images but I want somehow lower the resolution and also the quality does not need to be 100%. \nCan I somehow set the imported photo quality in Photos application or can I somewhere found the imported photos and lower the quality using some other application?\n\nA: Usually cameras provide settings that will allow you to shoot photos of smaller resolution, so if I wouldn't want images of that resolution, I would first look to change the shooting settings.\nHowever when I want to batch resize images in mac, here is some of my techniques:\nWith an Automator Workflow\n I have created an automator workflow of the following 2 steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask for Finder Items: with Allow Multiple Selection.  \n\n*Scale Images: where I specify the desired dimension.\n\n\nThen I click to run it, it asks me for the Finder Items, I select the images I want to resize and voila.\nNote that the above 2 automator steps are destructive, meaning that your images cannot be reverted back to their original size. It's generally recommended to add an extra step in your workflow to copy the files before resizing them.\nUsing Photos Export\nAnother option using Photos, is to use the export feature and create your desired export settings to rescale your images. Then you can import them back.\nImage Optimization\nFinally there is another tool I use it when I want to optimize jpeg files for the web: It is the imageOptim. It won't resize the images, rather than it will try to compress them even more, in order to save in weight.\n\nA: I highly recommend importing your photos at full resolution, on the off chance that you ever want to crop or make a big print or display on a high res screen in the future. With Apple Photos, you can import at full resolution and it will upload the full image to iCloud.\nThen, under Preferences: iCloud Photo Library select Optimize Mac Storage. Photos will now automatically switch to thumbnails when you start running low on space, and will automatically download the full-res version whenever you need to edit, view or export an image.\n", "Q: iPad, iphone linking and usage If I had an iPhone only on my iTunes account, could I use someone else's iPad to download an app to my iphone? If I used the app on their iPad, would it show that my iPhone downloaded and used the app?\n\nA: Any app belongs to the Apple ID that purchased it.\nYou cannot transfer it to another account. \nYou could download it to another device only by logging in with the Apple ID that made the original purchase.\nYou do this by going to Settings ➔ iTunes & App Store then tap on Apple ID, then tap Sign Out (of whoever is signed in) Then sign in with your Apple ID.\nEverything you've bought with that Apple ID (music, movies, apps) can be downloaded to that device.\nIf you used someone else's device to purchase an app using your own credentials, it would still be available for later download to your phone - though it would, of course, still be on the other person's device unless you deleted it afterwards. You can't remotely delete content from a device.\nYou can install apps on up to five iOS devices concurrently.\nIt goes without saying that letting someone else know your Apple ID login details could be potentially very unsafe.\n", "Q: How can I keep my Apple Watch from draining my iPhone's battery? I used to have to charge my iPhone 5s just once a day, over night.\nNow that I'm using an Apple Watch, I find that I have to charge my phone 3 or 4 times because my battery is draining.\nI'm not using my phone more. I'm actually often using it less, because I refer to my watch for things that used to happen on my phone.\nI'm not sure if it makes a difference, but I turned off almost every single notification.\n\nA: *\n\n*What does usage on the iPhone say? \n\n*Have you contacted Apple Support to check the power diagnostics at https://www.apple.com/support/iphone/repair/\nOnce you have some measurements and data, you can change which apps get notifications, which apps are allowed to run in the background and which apps do background refresh.\nYou can use the Apple Watch app to deinstall any apps you need to test their power usage and also look at the power usage on the Apple Watch.\nPeople that have honed their iOS power needs over the last 6+ years now have to consider a totally other use case. Now iOS can act as the server backing the Apple Watch as it offloads all of the third party app workload to the iPhone.\nBasically, you measure the usage on both devices. Try some changes to minimize the highest users, and then repeat to balance functionality and energy use.\nBefore watch, my iPhone 6 would end the day with 50 to 30% charge always and when it didn't I knew exactly why I was burning power at a faster rate and planned a charge to compensate. \nIt's taken a week to sort through Apple Watch and iPhone and I'm actually at better energy use now since I've stopped using the iPhone for some things and have rejected most Apple Watch apps as slow remotes for the iPhone. My glances are down to 6 items I need and 2 for fun. My Apple watch also is making it all day with plenty of power to spare unless I exercise with it for 3 hours a day. That's the only time I've had to do a mid day charge on the watch.\n", "Q: How do I mark a document as final in word for mac 2011 I have searched quite a few websites and all of them tell to go into \"Info\" menu and under the \"Permissions\" group you select the document to be marked as final.

Can anyone tell how can I mark the document as final in Word 2011 for Mac?\nEdit: \nAfter marking it as final I should be able to see the following when I open the document:\n\n\nA: On Word 2011 for Mac, marking as Final is found in the Review ribbon.  From here you can turn on/off Track Changes, accept or reject changes etc.\nI hope this is useful.\n\n", "Q: How do I connect user account with Time Machine back up? I have reinstalled my OS and copied my user account from a Time Machine backup using Migration Assistant.  However, now when Time Machine starts a back up, it says that it is copying 200 GB, which is the total size of my hard drive.  It seems that it has failed to identify my current user account as the same one that it already has back ups of.  \nI have tried changing my UID to match that of the Time Machine back up.  My UID now matches, but it still insists on backing up from scratch.  \n\nA: I saw your question before, but was at a loss to provide specific information. However, I took a look at Pondini's OSX and Time Machine Tips.\nIn particular on the page, How Local Backups are Stored, I noted that it's actually the hardware address, not the user ID, that is used as identification by Time Machine. From the page:\n\nEach Mac is identified by a hardware address internal to the Mac.   It's embedded in the Logic Board (motherboard).  The hardware address isn't displayed in the backups, but is kept in an extended attribute of the folder representing the Computer.\nThat's why when you get a new logic board, Time Machine thinks you got a new Mac.  That's also why you can rename your Mac (System Preferences > Sharing) and Time Machine will automatically rename the Computer folder on the backups;  or you can have two Macs with the same name, but Time Machine still knows which backups belong to which Mac.   \n\nHowever, on the same page, Pondini goes on to say that each backup volume is assigned a Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) that is in the extended attributes of the volume. Pondini says that this \"should\" cause Time Machine to automatically recognize the old backup.\nHowever, if Time Machine does not automatically recognize the old backup via the UUID, then there is a procedure for manually restoring the association.\nIt's getting fairly involved at that point, and though it might be worth the effort from an investigative standpoint, you might be better off starting your Time Machine backups from scratch (just to wipe the slate clean, so to speak).\n", "Q: Folder disappear from NAS only in Finder I'm using a Lenovo ix4-300d has my backup system for my archives and it work pretty well. The only downside right now (and it's not even them fault) is that some folder has disappeared from my Finder view. I still can access them via Terminal (not SSH, just cd into Volumes/share-name/archives) or via the web interface of the ix4-300d. Do someone have an idea how I can get them back on my Finder listing? I've already tried to delete .DS_Store via the web interface and I got no luck. \nHere is a screenshot from my 3 views…\n\n\nA: Perhaps the OSX system (i.e., Finder) is treating the folder like a hidden folder? In which case, it would be useful for you to have an Automator script that toggles the Hidden flag in the Finder. Once the script is created, it appears as a menu item under Finder menu >> Services.\nHere is the link to a previous discussion concerning showing hidden files.\n", "Q: How do I prevent files from being saved as .webarchive Whenever I want to save files like .csv files that were open in a safari tab, it forces me to either name it as .csv.webarchive or .webarchive. Is there a way to disable this?\n\nA: To answer the question about Saving in Safari:\nWhen you are about to save a page you are viewing in Safari, you will find a Select option in the saving dialogue, that will let you choose the format you want to save the page.\nBy default it will be set as Web Archive. But you can change it to Page Source, so it will save on the source of the page, which in the csv case, it will save the csv file.\nNext time, Safari will remember your last choice. \n\n\nA: Here is another small tip, for downloading files like csv, pdf, mp3 etc, that are opened and viewable in a Safari tab/window and have been accessed directly through their urls (e.g. the url address in safari address bar is something like: www.example.com/mycsv.csv, or www.example.com/mymovie.mp4, and so on...)\n\n\n*\n\n*Go and click inside the address bar, so it gets active.\n\n*Hold the ALT key down, and stroke once the ENTER key.\n\n\nSafari will reload the current page, and immediately will start downloading the current file.\n\nA: Webarchive (Wikipedia link) is a attempt to save the complete web page itself including all CSS and JavaScript files associated with it, not merely the CSV data displayed on the page.\nIf the site you are browsing contains a link to the file you need, you may be able to download it with an Option+Click or right click Download Linked File As...\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: Just rename the file as .csv  It may leave some residual information you don't need but just delete it...simple.\n", "Q: Question for applescript with dragon Dictate I want to make a program that will take the question I ask it, input it to WolframAlpha, take the answer, convert it to text and the say the text.\n    set defaultAnswer to \"\"\nset cancelButton to \"Cancel\"\nset buttonResearch to “ReSearch”\n\ndisplay dialog \"Query: \" default answer defaultAnswer buttons {cancelButton, buttonResearch} default button buttonResearch cancel button cancelButton with icon 1\ncopy the result as list to {button_pressed, text_returned}\n\nif (button_pressed is buttonResearch) and (text_returned is not \"\") then\n\n    open location \"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\" & my encode_text(text_returned, true, false)\n\n    set a to \"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\"\n    set b to my encode_text(text_returned, true, false)\n    set c to a & b\n\n    set myFile to (POSIX path of (path to temporary items)) & \"curl_file.xml\"\n    do shell script \"curl -L \" & c & \" -o \" & myFile\n\n\nend if\n\n-- encoding high-ASCII characters:\non encode_char(this_char)\n    set the ASCII_num to (the ASCII number this_char)\n    set the hex_list to {\"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"}\n    set x to item ((ASCII_num div 16) + 1) of the hex_list\n    set y to item ((ASCII_num mod 16) + 1) of the hex_list\n    return (\"%\" & x & y) as string\nend encode_char\n\n-- TEXT ENCODING: encode spaces and high-level ASCII characters (those above 127)\n-- encode_URL_A = encode most of the special characters reserved for use by URLs.\non encode_text(this_text, encode_URL_A, encode_URL_B)\n    set the standard_characters to \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789\"\n    set the URL_A_chars to \"$+!'/?;&@=#%><{}[]\\\"~`^\\\\|*\"\n    set the URL_B_chars to \".-_:\"\n    set the acceptable_characters to the standard_characters\n    if encode_URL_A is false then set the acceptable_characters to the acceptable_characters & the URL_A_chars\n    if encode_URL_B is false then set the acceptable_characters to the acceptable_characters & the URL_B_chars\n    set the encoded_text to \"\"\n    repeat with this_char in this_text\n        if this_char is in the acceptable_characters then\n            set the encoded_text to (the encoded_text & this_char)\n        else\n            set the encoded_text to (the encoded_text & encode_char(this_char)) as string\n        end if\n    end repeat\n    return the encoded_text\nend encode_text\n\nHow do i access the temporary file?\n\nA: This does the query part.

Is there any way to check which application(s) or file(s) are in use which causes the problem?\n\nA: By typing the command lsof /Volumes/Mac\\ HD\\ 2 into the terminal, you can get a list of which apps are using that volume. The output looks like this:\n\nThe COMMAND column should tell you what's using your disk, and what you have to quit.\nBased on your comment, it looks like the GitHub application is using your disk. Try quitting it first, then you should be able to do it.\nIn general, you can also use Recovery HD to safely perform disk operations without having open files spoil the fun.

Normally I would just control-click on the file in Finder to set the default program, but given that bash_profile is hidden I'm not sure how to go about this.\n\nA: You can temporarily show hidden files. In terminal write:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\nand then killall Finder to restart Finder.\nChange what you need and then hide hidden files again by changing TRUE to FALSE.\nEdit: Making this more explicit. In Finder, locate .bash_profile, open up the properties by right click + \"Get Info\". Then change the \"Open with\" to Sublime Text 2. This works, I just tried it.\n\n\nA: What about:\nsubl .bash_profile\n\ninstead of open. You can launch Sublime Text with subl, and append a filename to open it.\n\nA: You can do open -a \"Sublime Text 2\" ~/.profile Assuming that name is what's on the app's bundle.\n\nA: I do this all the time, but i do it from the command line:\nMy bash profile has the st macro mapped to: \nalias st='/Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl'\nAnd in the terminal i just type:\nst ~/.bash_profile\n\nA: Sublime Text Shortcut Guide\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mac Terminal\n\n*Go to homebrew.sh; copy and enter the following:\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\n*Enter brew install wget\n\n*Enter the following into your Mac Terminal: open ~/.bash_profile but if for whatever reason you don't have one configured, enter\nsudo nano .bash_profile.

The initial report was that iMovie won't open and play the projects. The iMovie owner also said that there was an iMovie crash while working on one of these projects recently.\nIndeed there are only certain projects that won't open, while most of them will play fine.\nTrashing the iMovie preference .plist file has no effect.\nThese projects seems corrupted and there is no backup. Is there any way to fix them?\n\nA: After some troubleshooting, I concluded that the issue with these projects was not inside the projects themselves, but in the events that have been used in these projects and to be more precise, with the thumbnails of these events. \nIt looks like something went wrong during or before the iMovie crash and affected the events video thumbnails.\nThe solution in my case:\n\nI forced iMovie to re-create the thumbnails of these events, by deleting\n  the thumbs folder inside iMovie events folder in Finder.\n\n\nHere is some further info, regarding the issue and how I ended up with recreating the thumbs:\nThe iMovie owner, had a special structure in separating his iMovie projects in folders by project topic. I found out that it was only some 8-10 projects under a specific folder that were unable to open-load inside iMovie. Some of them, they were able to open, but all they were showing in the viewer was just a gray screen.\nAlso, its worth noting that all the other iMovie projects in the library were working fine. \nI also noticed that when right-clicking on the problematic projects inside the project library, I was not getting the extended contextual menu that presents commands like duplicate, export etc, but only 2 commands: to create new project or new folder.\nTrashing iMovie preferences file had absolutely no effect, nor renaming the project files either. Searching on Google for similar issues, I couldn't find anything similar. Running onyx's cleaning features, repairing permissions, checking hard-drive system for corruption - all these were also in the mix - but with no result.\nFinally, I had an idea:\nI sent a project file (containing no events/video) to my own mac and tried to open it. It opened just fine, with the exception that it couldn't find the source files. \nThat lead me to think that the project files were fine and that I rather have to check for the events.\nThe owner had a similar folder structure for his events as well. So, all the events used in the above projects, were inside their single folder in iMovie Events folder. As first move, I moved that folder outside of iMovie events folder and opened iMovie. \nAt this time, all projects were able to open. Also, the extended context menu appeared back. I was close to my final conclusion but yet I wasn't sure what was wrong. The videos, the caches, the thumbs? So, putting back in the events folder, one by one files and folders, I got my answer. \nThe thumbs were corrupted. \nJust to make sure everything will be fine, I finally let only the actual events video files inside that folder, opened iMovie and let it re-generate/optimize the events videos of that folder. \nIt took about 4 hours for iMovie to complete this, but after that all projects are working fine.\n", "Q: Disable power button on 2015 MBP Me and my friends like having a laugh together and as part of that we turn each other computers off and spam tabs till the computer crashes. Is thee a way how to disable the power button on my MBP 2015 to prevent my friends from turning my computer by holding down the power button? If possible I would like to remap it to command+power or command+option+power. \nSo far the only way to stop them is physically moving their hand away in time (which I always do). Would be nice to do my work without having to move their hand all the time!\n\nA: No. While an individual press of the power button can be reconfigured into a keyboard shortcut/function using third party software, the Press and Hold feature of it is a failsafe commonly included with computer systems and is stored at the firmware level of the system to allow you to shut the system down should it lock up. You will not be able to change the behavior.\n", "Q: Macbook pro mid 2012: Can I install win 8.1 UEFI or will I have driver issues? I would like to install win 8.1 along my current OSX ML on my macbook pro, mid 2012.\nI was told that UEFI installs have advantages over MBR but I have also heard that might bring drivers issues because Apple did not make UEFI drivers or something like that.\nWhat do you guys think? Is it worth it? Am I going to experience frustrating issues?\n\nA: Any MacBook Pro with model identifier of MacBookPro10 or less does not have an UEFI. MacBook Pro (15 and 13 inch, Mid 2012) computers have model identifiers MacBookPro9,1 and MacBookPro9,3, respectively. The MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) has model identifier MacBookPro10,1. I assume your model does not have a Retina display, therefore I assume you should install using a BIOS/MBR booting.\nI hear UEFI offers faster booting. I also hear this requires a single boot configuration. Well, you will being dual booting with OS X, so you can't take advantage of this feature anyway.\nAnother advantage to UEFI booting is access to a larger number of partitions. UEFI booting uses the GUID partitioning table (GPT). This has default limit of 128 partitions. BIOS booting requires Windows to use the MBR partitioning table. This limits Window access to only 4 partitions in  the GPT. On Mac computers, generally 3 partitions are used by OS X, leaving a single partition for Windows. There are ways around this single partition limit, but this requires abandoning the use of the Boot Camp Assistant.\n\nA: Apple either supports Windows on UEFI or BIOS on a given Mac model, but not both. They have never released drivers for both, to my knowledge. As far as I know, the 2015 Retina MacBook Pros are the first macs to not support BIOS emulation, necessitating UEFI drivers. I am not certain about older models. In order to take advantage of Apple's drivers, you have to install Windows in a configuration they support (at least when it comes to UEFI or BIOS).\n", "Q: Why is it that my MacBook Pro Retina's resolution is detected as different based on the application? The actual advertized resolution is 2880 x 1800.\nTaking a fullscreen, screenshot gives me an image that is 2880 x 1800.\nGoing to this site tells me my resolution is 1440 x 900.\nThe built in Digital Color Meter tells me my resolution is 1440 x 900.\nThis bit of Java code:\nDimension screenSize = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize();\ndouble width = screenSize.getWidth();\ndouble height = screenSize.getHeight();\nSystem.out.println(width + \" x \" + height);\n\nhas an output of 1440 x 900.\nSo why is this and how do I fix it?\n\nA: I am an iOS developer, so have a bit of an idea what is causing this.  Apple measure screen size in points rather than pixels, and depending on whether your screen is a retina display or not, will change the scaling factor between points and physical pixels.\nIn your case, because you have a high-resolution Retina display, OS X is applying a scale factor of 2.0.  This means that a webpage that has been designed with an element 500px across will still appear the right physical size (however it will in fact be 1000px across).\nIt's not a bug, it's a feature that means the retina display can still show the \"old-fashioned\" normal resolution content.\n", "Q: Renamed Home Folder, now Dropbox Mac App won't launch I renamed my home folder using these directions from Apple - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201548\nWorked great.

When I use iMessages, is a copy of all messages retained in iCloud (on Apple's servers)? If yes, how can I delete them?\n\nA: iCloud does store copies of your iMessages with the backup of the iDevices. To delete them, you'd have to delete every iCloud-Backup that contains the message.\nAs to my knowledge, there is no user-accessible copy of the iMessage stored apart from the backups.\n", "Q: OSX Photos Events and Albums Have same photos I have migrated from iPhoto to OSX Photos. All my Events are there with all their photos. Back in iPhoto I had Albums and Events with Events always the master. I could delete a photo from Albums and it would stay in Events. That was fine. What are the rules for Photos pls? I can see the same photos in both Events and Albums but when I search for a photo (that I know is in both places) it shows up only in Events. I delete a photo from Events and it stays in Albums. Any clues pls?\n\nA: Events are now just albums. So, you can remove specific photos from Albums or \"Events\" without deleting the photo. Only if you delete a photo from the main Photos view is it actually deleted (and then, under File: Show Recently Deleted, you can recover it for 30 days).\nI recommend deleting events that are no longer useful, as the Photos view now nicely converts into years and locations as you zoom out, which you might previously have manually set up as events.\n", "Q: How to remove shortcuts from Launchpad installed by Windows through Parallels 10?

There, you should find all the shortcuts, you can simply remove them all, or just the ones you do not want to have shown.\nNote, I uninstalled Parallels already and just removed the entire Applications (Parallels) folder without issues. Unsure if that is still a wise solution when you still have Parallels installed, but just wanted to add that.\n\nA: The standard way to remove items from Launchpad is to click-hold any icon til the icons start to 'dance', then click the X, top left corner.\nHowever, this only appears to be possible for apps downloaded from the App Store. Other apps have no X.\nI think the sensible workaround might be similar to how you'd have to achieve it on an iPhone…\nMake a new 'folder' by dragging one app on top of another, then use that to keep all your unwanted launch icons tucked away on a screen you don't often visit.\n\nA: Maybe this is an old question, but I've just found an page on Apple Communities.

It still works once I type my password in, but it's slightly annoying.\nWould anyone have any suggestion on how to fix this? Cheers!\nMac OS 10.10.3.\n\nA: I have the same issue. Did some Google searching and tried to clean the cache in the font database through terminal: \"sudo atsutil databases -remove; atsutil server -shutdown\"\nThis did not work, so the other option would be to remove San Francisco for now from your user folder. Haven't tried that yet.\n\nA: I just fixed that problem on my Mac.  I removed the San Francisco Font from ~/Library/Fonts, then ran the sudo command to clean the cache, then restarted the system.

How can I enter a soft return character (Shift-Enter) on iOS?\n\nA: There is actually a way by using the microphone symbol on your keyboard and then saying “nieuwe regel”. That is Dutch for “new line” but I am not sure what the exact english equivolant is. But it works, it creates a soft return.\n\nA: The answer is actually surprisingly simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Say you are on WhatsApp, typing a text to be sent. You want to insert a new paragraph after a stop punctuation sign.\n\n*Press the Shift key to make sure is not enabled.\n\n*Now press and hold the Shift key and press the Return key once. There's your soft return!\n\n\n*\n\n*You can actually press the Return key (with the Shift key being held) more than once should you want to insert further returns in your text.\n\n\n\nA: A soft line break is not supported by the iOS keyboard (nor, to my knowledge, by SwiftKey or Swype), but you can copy/paste an existing soft return from any other text.\nI cannot give an example here, because the Stack Exchange markup doesn't know a soft return either. Instead, you can see this in action in the following Quora thread: How do I enter a soft return character (Shift-Enter) on iOS?\n\nA: Extending zoagli's own answer, though again not a perfect solution as it adds potentially unwanted spaces you need to go back & tidy up.\nCopy/paste a soft return from somewhere, then in System Prefs > Keyboard > Text you can add a new Replace, for instance sret, & paste the soft return to the With column.\nThat will then propagate over iCloud to your other devices & turn sret into a soft \nreturn - though not on SE, as previously mentioned [unless you look at this answer in Edit]. It will also have a leading & trailing space, which you may need to go back & trim.\n", "Q: Filesystem permissions for /var/mobile/Media/DCIM/.MSIC/Incoming I have changed the permissions on /var/mobile/Media/DCIM/.MSIC/Incoming.

I installed one app which adds special folder to my Favorites sidebar in Finder. I like the app, but I don't like polluting the sidebar. Unfortunately, the app doesn't allow me to turn off the behavior and even if I manually remove the folder, it appears again after some time (didn't do any special tests though whether it's after restart or when...).\nMy idea is that if I could come with some bash command to remove this folder from Finder's sidebar, I could put it to .bash_profile so it gets executed quite often. I'd fight with the same weapons - from time to time, I'd just remove the folder if present. The question is - is there some command?\nI looked for it, but couldn't find any clues. Is there e.g. some text or XML file with Favorites listed I could programatically edit in bash?\n\nA: Click on the item and drag it out of the sidebar. Pause for a moment and a little cloud will appear under the cursor. Release the cursor. The cloud will disappear and the item will be gone from the sidebar.\nOtherwise, if it keeps coming back, look in the preferences for iDrive to see if it can be disabled.\n", "Q: Internet sharing disabling Macbook Wifi So I wanted to share the Ethernet connection through my Wifi to my phone, since it is having problems connecting to my router at home.\nMy Wifi works fine on it's own.

Sometime it turns on back, sometimes it doesnt. What could be the cause of this problem?? My Mac is 2012\n\nA: An intermittent issue like that could be as simple as broken wires, or cracked internal connectors, that make/break connection, which causes the unit to sometimes work, sometimes fail.\nIt would be prudent to send the unit in for repairs by Apple, and hopefully you have a Time Machine backup of your system.\n\nA: Three beeps when you start your mac are indications of RAM issues. \nYou can look up your specific manual at http://apple.com/support/manuals to see if the RAM is user serviceable. If so, you can try swapping the chips, reseating them or testing with just one chip in each slot.\nIf the RAM isn't user serviceable, you'll likely need to get the files backed up and then in for repair or replacement.\n", "Q: Cannot maximize a window by simply clicking on the Photoshop CC app icon My OS is Yosemite and I work in CC apps daily.\nI minimize several ways (clicking on the minimize button in the window, command + M, etc.) but I used to be able to just go down to the Photoshop app icon in my dock, simply click once and all my windows within would maximize.\nPlease note: I'm not trying to zoom.\nCurrently I have to go to the icon, click and hold then highlight \"Show all Windows\" in order for the windows to maximize again.\nDoes anyone know if there is a system fix? I prefer NOT having to add a source app. Thanks\n\nA: I know you specifically asked for a system fix, but I'm going to suggest an alternative.  I can understand your frustration with the issue as I've worked with CS apps too.\nWith option-clicking ( ⌥ + left click ) the program icon in the dock, you toggle the entire app's windows on or off.  It leaves the current state of all open windows and their current position/size.\nThe click-and-hold method you're using would seem frustrating.  You can get to that quicker by just right-clicking the icon (or in case of a trackpad, 2-finger click), or you could just use the hotkey control + down ( ⌃↓ ).\nTo be clear, the command + M combo you're using will minimize just whatever window is focused, and the trick I mentioned earlier will not restore it - you will still have to get that back via either the Window menu or the other methods we've discussed.\nAlso you aren't referring to actually maximizing windows, but rather restoring them I believe.  Maximizing can occur on windows in Yosemite by option-clicking the '+' \"full screen\" button on a window.

How? Summary\niTunes appears to have a formidable weakness. It does not appear to be possible to store a subset of one's collection on a Mac, just as one routinely does on an iOS device.\nDetails\nWe normally treat an iPod, an iPad, and an iPhone as a slave device, by that I mean that we declare a Mac a master device, store our complete iTunes library on the Mac, and sync the iOS (slave) device using some given criteria.\nI would like to do exactly the same process between two Macs. I would like to declare one Mac/OS X the master device and store the complete iTunes collection on it. I would then declare a second (third, etc) Mac/OS X the slave and sync with the master device.\nAs you can guess, the idea is that one OS X (the \"slave\" in this context) will be your work machine with its disk dedicated to serious stuff (and/or comes with fast/limited storage), while the other OS X (the \"master\") will be your media machine with large (disk-based) storage.\nCan one sync iTunes between two OS X machines? How?\nUpdate: This question is similar, but the rsync option is not suitable. The point is not to store a duplicate, but a small subset of the full collection. It seems a solution is not possible with stock utilities at this time, at least not until the competing ecosystem offers a viable solution to the same problem, but don't hold your breath.\n\nA: I have a setup in which my entire iTunes library (not just my media folder) is housed on an external hard drive. This allows it to be portable - I take it between computers, open iTunes, and it'll 'update' the database so it can pull from it. All data and settings in mine transfer over. \nThe drive makes it easier when managing a very large music library with a multitude of playlists and also want to update your phone from multiple computers/eases replacement of an existing computer. This might be able to achieve the same result you're looking for, and will also address the concerns over space. I was able to pick up a 1TB external USB 3.0 drive for ~$100.\n", "Q: Changed user password by providing new password as hash not syncing to filevault 2 I have been using \ndefaults write \"path/to/username.plist\" shadowhashdata '(really long hash info)'\nto administer a local support account on our Mac's but I have found, and it may be since updating to 10.10.1, that the file vault password is not getting updated when this is run.\n\nA: Updating an account's password for the FileVault 2 pre-boot login screen needs to involve the opendirectoryd process when changing the account's password. Writing the new password hash directly to the plist file bypasses opendirectoryd, so the password sync process never kicks in.\nIf you need to change the password this way, you may need to remove and re-add the user account with fdesetup. This will flush the old password's derived key for FileVault 2 and set up a derived key for the new password.\nRemove:\nfdesetup remove -user username_goes_here \n\nRe-add:\nfdesetup add -usertoadd username_goes_here  \n\nNote: As part of doing the remove and re-add, you will need to provide either the password of a FileVault 2-enabled account or a personal recovery key associated with the machine in order to authorize the changes. One thing that's important to keep in mind is that once you run fdesetup remove for your local administrator account, the account will no longer be enabled for FileVault 2 and will not be able to authorize the running of fdesetup add. Make sure you have a personal recovery key available or enable another user account for FileVault 2, then use the recovery key or that second account's password to authorize the re-adding of your local administrator account.\nCommentary: I asked about the practice of writing password hashes to plist files in order to change passwords while I was at this year's WWDC. I received the following feedback from Apple engineers:\n\"That's horrifying. Don't do that.\"\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/message/8028\n", "Q: iCloud email - server password changed?

Can someone help point me in the right direction of where I can find help please?\n\nA: I just contacted Apple Support and they confirmed this was a new Apple ID authentication issue.

It doesn't respond using the Home and Sleep buttons.\n\nA: I'm not sure if you've jailbroken your iPhone or not, but default functionality for the home+sleep on all iPhones is to do a screenshot no matter the application that you are in.  Signed apps from the Apple App Store are not allowed to override this built-in OS level functionality.\nYour home button or sleep buttons might have a problem.  Do they function normally on their own?  If so, then it could be that you have an accessibility feature enabled which is overriding or interfering with this default behavior.\nJust in case none of the above is the situation, my final thought would be that you aren't correctly engaging the screenshot combination.  As a refresher or to clarify, you would hold the Home button along with the Sleep button at the same time.  I have found that sometimes starting with the Sleep button can throw it off, so I start with the Home button and then quickly add the Sleep button a short moment later and then let go of all of it once the screen flashes (if audio is not muted you also get a camera shot sound).\nAlso, I'm assuming you know, but maybe you don't: you find your screenshots in your camera roll in Photos.  I'm not sure if you were expecting it someplace else maybe.  It doesn't put it into the clipboard if that's what you might have thought.\nIn case you might be looking for capturing a video of your iPhone screen (or alternatively you can do a screenshot), you can accomplish this by running QuickTime Player on your Mac (if you have one), connect the iPhone via a lightning USB cable, then go to File → New Movie Recording (⌥⌘N).

My iPod touch got stuck in a screen and it says to connect to iTunes, and the only backup I have is an iPhone 5S 7.0.4 backup. I don't want to break anything. Will it work?\n\nA: Yes, this works fine. Device backups are interchangeable between device models, including iPad ⇔ iPhone.\n\nA: Unfortunately the short answer to your question is no, but I have a solution that should be workable to solve your problem.  First of all, you may be able to restore an iPhone backup to an iPod or vice-versa, but this is not going to fix the issue.  To expound on the rest: Apple no longer supports the SHSH blob files that used to be usable to restore to older firmware.  In a short window of opportunity upon each new release Apple continues \"signing\" the prior version of the firmware in case you don't like the new one or have trouble with it.  This is the only possibility for downgrading that I'm aware of at this point. Usually this window of opportunity is only a month or maybe a couple of weeks.\nTo solve your problem let me first describe the issue: You have found your iPod in one of the following states: DFU (device firmware update) mode, or Recovery Mode.  You have a couple of options to get it out of this state.\n\n*\n\n*Use the reboot button combo (press/hold both the Sleep button & the Home button for about 10-15 seconds).  Once the Apple logo appears, let go.\n\n*If that doesn't work, download and use a well-known tool called TinyUmbrella. You can find it here.  You attach your iPod to the system with the usb cable.  Exit iTunes & start up TinyUmbrella.  When you open TinyUmbrella it detects the device you have in DFU or Recovery mode.  You can select it and then click the \"Exit Recovery\" or \"Exit DFU Mode\" button.  Your device should reboot and start up normally.\n\n*You can attempt to restore the firmware to the latest version through iTunes, potentially losing everything that you've got on it.  Let me know if you need a quick refresher on how that's done.\n\nIt seems people have found that restoring one device's backup to an entirely different one is possible, but this actually is not recommended due to the variations in settings per device.  If you do attempt this, you should go to Settings->General->Reset->Reset All Settings to be sure that you don't end up with some weird bugs due to your other device's settings being on there.\nEven if you are successful in restoring the backup, this doesn't actually include the OS firmware.  So you aren't likely to get your iPod out of the mode it's in just by restoring a backup.\n\nA: Theoretically yes.\nThe restore process upgrades your device to the latest version of iOS, so the fact it's a backup from an older version shouldn't cause problems. There is nothing that should cause permanent damage to your device by trying.\nThat said, I would follow @JasonCramer's steps of trying to get it out of DFU mode first before attempting to restore a backup.\n\nA: If you want to make a backup from your iPod to your iPhone you will have problems, because the Apple's script is not accepting iOS minor than 8 right now (That's called downgrade). But if want to make an \"Upgrade\" so you have no problem with that, and it will work even with different devices.\n", "Q: Parallels desktop keeps creating windows/ubuntu folders in launchpad When i remove Windows/Ubuntu folder from ~/Applications i am not seeing them in the launchpad.\nBut whenever i launch parallels desktop - it automatically creates Windows/Ubuntu folders:\n\nHow to prevent parallels from creating these folders again?\nEDIT.

However, I do not want to purchase a cell or data plan for this junker iphone. \nWould this be doable? \nI know my question is similar to this post, but I don't know if there are other considerations I should account for with this plan. Thanks for your feedback!\n\nA: Wifi will not work as iPhone do not automatically connect to new wifi networks.  Like Mark said you will need a data plan and Ting is a good one.  On top of that you will need to make sure the phone has a constant power source and best to have it hidden.  You may want to find a 12v wire that is on when your car is one and use an adapter to connect your phone to that and keep it under the seat or something.\nOne thing that will also do is when the car is off and the phone's battery dies the phone will turn off.  Turning on the car will recharge and turn on phone again so you can leave it be.\n\nA: Likely not, as you need some sort of data connection to pass back the location to Apple.  It would only check in if in range of a WiFi network it had connected to in the past.\nYou could look at a cheap phone plan through Ting (https://ting.com/).  If you didn't use minutes and less than 100mb of data a month for the location, it would be about $9 per month.\n\nA: Cell phones are required to allow 911 calls in emergencies. If someone steals your car, and the hidden cell phone inside, this seems to warrent an emergency or at least a police request to the cell phone service provider to help locate the phone in a police investigation. Wire up your phone and charger, all hidden of course, to keep the battery charged. Remove all old apps and dim the screen brighteness to lowest setting to preserve power. \n", "Q: unsyncing an iphone 4 Someone synced my iphone 4 with their ipad without my knowledge or permission. I have tried to find a setting or action on my iphone to \"unsync\" my phone from the ipad or other devices, but was unsuccessful. what can i do now?\n\nA: What data is syncing with the iPad?  It sounds like the other person logged into their iCloud account on your phone which would give you any or all of: mail, contacts, calendars, reminders, safari bookmarks, notes, passbook, keychain, photos.  Is that what you're seeing?  If so you need to log your phone out of their iCloud account.  Go into Settings -> General -> iCloud and at the bottom you'll see \"Delete Account\".  \nIf the other person enabled Find My iPhone with their iCloud account you MUST have them disable it on your phone, which they can do that directly on the phone or on iCloud.com.  There's no other way to disable it.  If you try a full reset the phone will boot back up with the Activation lock (aka: iCloud lock) switched on and it'll be nothing but a paperweight until the other person unlocks it. \n", "Q: Terminal find, rename by deletion Mac will append a ' 2' (note the space) to the end of a file/folder that is  a copy of another file/folder inside the same directory...

How do I let them text message friends etc without all the messages coming to my IM also? I'm not very knowledgable on tech stuff, they only have email addresses not phone numbers and all their messages are coming to my inbox also. \n\nA: If all you care about is having your kids text message only people who have Apple devices signed into an Apple account using iCloud, then the process is pretty straightforward.  You go to the settings on the iPads and then head over to Messages -> Send & Receive.  On this page you can add whatever email addresses you've made up for your kids and then confirm with your Apple ID.  Their email will be sent a confirmation with a link that needs to be clicked.  Now you can set their Send & Receive to only have that address checked for \"You can be reached by iMessage at\" and for \"Start new conversations from\".\nThe actual texting to/from any number capable of text messaging is only going to function within the context of your iPhone's ability (i.e. your phone number).  You can either enable or disable that feature for each specific device(iPad), or if they are data capable devices (not the WIFI only version, but rather 4G/LTE) then maybe the provider will be able to set them up a phone number for texting (I'm not 100% sure on that so check with them first).\nBasically, even though Apple devices can all be set up using specific addresses to send/receive messages from, they really can't send from one single data/texting package and route only between specific devices based on some other hidden meta data (meta data which is impossible to exist within a text message btw).\nSo let me try to make it simpler.  You can allow for the iPads (say WIFI-only) to send/receive text messages by way of the Text Message Forwarding feature, yet it will always appear on your iPhone because ultimately that's where messages are delivered from/to.  If your iPads message someone in the Apple ecosystem (i.e. has an Apple ID) then the individual address you set up on those iPads for Messages -> Send & Receive can be used.  This is strictly limited however to Apple IDs or addresses associated with one.\n", "Q: Safari won't open in Yosemite I recently got my computer re-imaged. Everything was working fine on Yosemite until about an hour ago when my Wi-Fi abruptly disconnected. The AirPort icon gave me the rainbow spinner, so I restarted my computer. The Wi-Fi issue disappeared upon restart, but Safari (which had been open as my default browser before the restart) now refuses to open. When I click on the app in my dock, applications folder, Launchpad, and anywhere else, it doesn't open. The icon doesn't bounce, and the app won't work even when I click on a link in an email or something. There's no crash log. Any fixes for this?\n\nA: I would check Activity Monitor while you are clicking the Safari icon. See if there are any processes like \"Safari\" or \"Safari Web Content\" that is showing up, and see if there is a red \"not responding\". This probably will not happen if the app does not even bounce, but it's worth a try. You can also try basic things like right clicking, clicking \"Show all windows\" or going to Options and clicking asking to this desktop. Also, have you been working with multiple displays recently? The safari window may be \"stuck\" on the other display, so you should check it out by plugging any back in.\n\nA: Not sure if this will help - but I had a (sort of) similar issue.\nWhen I opened Safari, it would sit in the dock and nothing would happen. No window, nothing. I was perplexed.\nWhat I didn't ever realise is that there was no window defined. \nI right clicked the icon in the dock and selected 'New Window'.\nA massive Homer Simpson 'Doh!' ensued. \n", "Q: How to make 64-bit guests available in a nested VirtualBox installation on iMac 5K 27-inch?

DO NOT delete the emails and contacts themselves manually, they will be removed from the iPad when you remove the account from it.\nDepending on the age of your kid and how much you want to keep him/her from getting access to your emails and contacts, it might also be enough to just disable Mail, Contacts, Calendars and/or Notes from the Gmail account screen instead of removing the entire account. If you do this, just enabling them again will put the email and contacts back on the device.\n\nA: This option:\n-> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -> Select your Gmail account -> Tap the Delete Account button.\nWas not available on my device.  \nI found that the account had only been setup through the Gmail app.  If that is the case, open up the Gmail app and go to \"Manage Settings\". Long press on the account you would like to remove and it will give you the option to edit.  From there you can delete the account.\nI was recovering an iPad for another user and deleted the gmail app.  When I installed Google Drive, it automatically signed in with the old account.  I had to reinstall the Gmail app. After that, I was able to remove the account from \"Manage Settings\" within the Gmail app.\n", "Q: Quitting Mail is very slow Since a few years I can't quit Mail.app instantly.

I am trying to use Google's photo service to backup my library from my Mac Mini.  I have installed the Google Desktop Uploader application from the photos.google.com site.\nThe application does not seem to allow me to select my Photos library in the preferences as it is grayed out.  If I select the \"Pictures\" parent folder, the application does not find my photos and they are not uploaded.\nMy Photos library resides on the internal drive in my mini, and is about 131GB in size.\n\nA: To make sure \"Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters/\" stays permanently in the list of folders, you must remove \"Pictures/\" from the list.\nI found Google Photos Backup rejects folders contained in folders already in the list; since \"Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters/\" is inside \"Pictures/\"... you get the ... picture.\n\nA: I wasn't sure if this was possible, but I'm please to report that it is, and I'm going to use it myself. The trick is to understand that Photos Library.photoslibrary is a Package File that Google Photos Backup doesn't know how to see inside. However, Finder does. So, right click on Photos Library.photoslibrary (normally inside your Pictures folder) and select Show Package Contents. All of your pictures are inside of Masters, organized by date added (however note that any edits you made in Apple Photos are not included; these are the original images).\nNow, run Google Photos Backup and click Add to select the folder. Drag the Masters folder into the File Dialog:\n\nNow click Choose, and you've succeeded in getting the Google Photos Backup to look inside the Apple Photo package. You may want to unclick the other watched folders, since Apple Photo should already be importing all images.\nI just figured this out, so I'll update if I find any downsides. Since Google Photos is completely free for the High Quality images (as opposed to Original resolution), it will be interesting to compare the two services.\n\nA: The latest version of the desktop uploader can now recognise and upload directly from Photos library.\n\nA: There is a configuration file for Google Photos Backup that will allow you to manually enter the value. \nLook inside your Application Support directory and add the full path to your Photos app Masters directory:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit the Google Photos Backup application (so your changes aren't overwritten by auto-save)\n\n*Open a new Finder window\n\n*Go to your user Home directory (Shift-Command-H)\n\n*Open Library -> Application Support -> Google -> Google Photos Backup -> db\n\n*You should see a directory named for the email address associated to your Google account.

All photos that are pre-existing in the Photos app library seem to be ignored. I'm curious if there is some way to \"touch\" each file in the Masters directory so that Google Photos Backup will suddenly see them.\n", "Q: How to mute a FaceTime iPhone call on OS X through a shortcut? When using FaceTime on OS X 10.10 to initiate a call using the iPhone, is there a shortcut that allows me to mute the call from the keyboard?\n\nIs there a keyboard shortcut (or a way to setup a shortcut) to trigger the Mute function?\n\nA: Yes you can! Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and create an Automator Service, with a single Run AppleScript action, containing the following code:\nHigh Sierra and later:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Notification Center\"\n    if checkbox \"Mute\" of window 1 exists then\n        click checkbox \"Mute\" of window 1\n    end if\nend tell\n\nSierra and earlier:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    if checkbox \"Mute\" of window 1 of application process \"FaceTime\" exists then\n        click checkbox \"Mute\" of window 1 of application process \"FaceTime\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\n*Set the service to receive \"no input\" and to work in \"any application\", save it with a name of your choosing.\n\n*Now, go into the Shortcuts tab in the Keyboard preferences in System Preferences, and click on Services. The newly created service should be at the bottom, under the name you chose. Click on the service, then click on \"add shortcut\" to its right, and specify a shortcut to your liking.\n\n*You may have to grant Automator and/or FaceTime access in Accessibility in the Privacy tab of the Security and Privacy preferences.\n\n\nThat's it!

(used usbmodem1422 as the argument.\n\nA: The icon indicates its probably a serial device (i.e. a virtual com port). \nNormally you need to click the + sign below (your first screenshot), then select a interface, a default name will be presented (in your case Microcontroller). You could rename the service afterwards.\nThe problem is once the device is added its hard to see which port its connected to. Now if you goto the Terminal and type:\n# list all h/w ports\nnetworksetup -listallhardwareports\n\n# list Services and their connected port\nnetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder\n\nThe last command should show you something like:\n(1) Ethernet 1\n(Hardware Port: Ethernet 1, Device: en0)\n\n(2) Ethernet 2\n(Hardware Port: Ethernet 2, Device: en1)\n\n(x) Microcontroller\n(Hardware Port: xxxx, Device: YYYY)\n\nThe device name (YYYY) you should find in your /etc folder (if connected).\nSo, if the device is connected you should find it in that /dev folder. You can check this by going to the terminal and type:\nls -l /dev | grep <the name of the h/w port>\n\nIf you then disconnect the device and they the command (above) again, and it disappears your sure.\nTo answer your question: how it works and how you set it up depends on what type of device it is. And its hard to say just based on this information.\nApparently this device got somehow added. As Ashely states, it could be a Raspberry PI, or some other USB device (with serial port).\n\nA: I have an Arduino (which has a \"microcontroller\" processor).  I'm no expert on \"modern\" devices (like this, and Raspberry Pi etc), but I have worked with older similar systems.\nOn my system, the Arduino instructions suggested I installed the CodeBender development software to work with the device.  That insisted on installing driver-installer.mpkg, which seems to contain FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext, which seems to implement /dev/cu.usbmodemfa121 and a setting in System Preferences > Network similar to that in your screenshot.  Sadly I couldn't find any documentation from CodeBender explaining this: I had to look closely at the installation package to work this out.\nOn my Arduino, I believe the microcontroller has a USB wrapper around a virtual RS232 port.  It's used to send compiled code to the Arduino from the development software on the Mac, and in the other direction for the Arduino to send output back to the Mac.\nIn the comments, you say that the main Raspberry Pi USB port doesn't have data connections.  But perhaps the development software has installed this network/USB/RS232 port anyway.  It appears on my Mac even when the Arduino is not connected.\n", "Q: What does \"Increase Contrast\" option change? Many forums say, that enabling Increase Contrast option in Accessibility Preferences helps Yosemite to make the animations, like entering Mission Control to be much smoother. This is also consistent with my experience.\nIncrease Contrast off: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctOj1U4OZio&index=3&list=PLsZWReFinrU5GLvs7ILwGvAVTICcjLhTD\nIncrease Contrast on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNac3VPZDKI&index=2&list=PLsZWReFinrU5GLvs7ILwGvAVTICcjLhTD\nWhat I am interested in, debugging what causes the general slowness of Yosemite interface. It is clear, that at least one of the reasons is canceled when I turn Increase Contrast on. Common sense says, that Increase Contrast turns on Reduce Transparency option too, so it might be the reason, because calculating the transparency of the semi-transparent layers is a hard thing to do. This is not the case, because enabling Reduce Transparency only has no effect on the speed at all.\nSo the question is: what does Increase Contrast switch? Some GPU parameters? Less textures? Using other rendering algorithms? Something has to be.\n\nA: I can't comment specifically on the Contrast setting, however there are various defaults you can enable from the terminal that will speed things up - specifically window \"show\" delays.\nBrowse some of these scripts:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://gist.github.com/brandonb927/3195465\n\n*https://gist.github.com/maxfenton/c5a316f4254d27b18cf3\nYou will find various commands to reduce the delay between showing windows, \nExample:\nTo speed up mission control you could do:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.1\nkillall Dock\n\nThis will reduce the animation delay to .1 second before showing mission control\nIts possible some of these settings get tweaked when you go into enhanced contrast mode.\n", "Q: Mac OSX installer is disabled or not accessable I have a persistent problem where my installer is not associated with pkg files.

It's always the best time to buy Apple products when a new one is announced.\n\n\n*\n\n*You know exactly what the latest bump is and can choose to get \"last year's model\" on sale from Apple or for a very good price used or buy the latest.\n\n*Between new and refurbished, you probably have 4 (or 6) price points instead of the 2 you normally get buying new from Apple.\n\n\nAs to the specifics of your \"upgrade\" - it's a great time to upgrade.\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel CPU are massively more efficient and powerful from 2009 to 2015\n\n*USB is massively better - both in absolute terms and that Macs from 2009 had less optimal drivers for them IMO.\n\n*SSD storage is far better than HDD for almost every use case. Not only are you getting that jump, the the SSD in 2014/2015 are far better than 2012 and earlier in terms of performance and $/perf.\n\n*Retina screens are excellent for cases where you have lots of elements (Xcode and text) as well as far more pleasing than LCD from 2009 era.\n\n*You get a new Mac after 5 years\n\n\nAll of the above reasons would make your work environment much more inspiring. Especially if you can sell your old Mac or donate it and afford the new one.\n\nA: I Know that i am late but if you still have the macbook pro 15 inch 2009 you should put an ssd (solid state drive) in it and 8gb of ram. my friend just got a 2015 macbook air and mine is almost as fast as his. + those macbook pros are really expensive. trust me if you haven't upgraded it yet, you should try it as it is a huge improvement from the hdd (hard disk drive). and if you use a lot of cd's you won't have to connect an external drive every time your need to use it. plus the screen is a 1440 x 900 the new screens are 2560 by 1600 it isn't that much of a difference really they make it seem better than it really is. Also the bigger screen means more screen real estate which means bigger apps open at the same time. I really suggest you try this first before upgrading (if u haven't yet) and if you still think you need an upgrade, go for it.\n", "Q: How to view multiple inboxes on Apple Watch (individually) It seems like in the iPhone's Watch app for email I can select one and only one mailbox to read from the Watch (Include Mail setting). I really dislike the \"All Inboxes\" concept, but would like to have two of my four inboxes available, along with a sub-folder or two. Is that possible with the stock Mail app? Thanks!\n\nA: From the Apple Watch user box (https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1708/en_US/apple_watch_user_guide.pdf): \"Choose which mailbox appears on Apple Watch. Open the Apple Watch app on iPhone, tap My Watch, then go to Mail > Include Mail. You can specify only one mailbox, although if you don’t choose a mailbox, you’ll see content from all inboxes.\"\n", "Q: Scaling external display text & UI components I have a late 2013 Retina Macbook Pro which drives a Dell P2815Q 28\" 4K monitor (at 30Hz). What I would like is to have scaled UI components whilst retaining the resolution of the monitor, rather than having to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the full resolution with tiny fonts and UI components\n\n*Use 1920x1080 scaled HiDPI mode, which doesn't provide enough screen space (although the text is lovely and clear).\n\n\nThe options I currently have for the external monitor are:\n\nWhat I'd like is to be able to scale the display as I can for the Retina MBP screen:\n\nI've found plenty of posts explaining how to enable all resolutions under the 'Scaled' tab. This is not the solution I'm after because it doesn't make the font/UI components smaller whilst retaining a crisp resolution.\n\nA: I have found the MacBooks to be rather flakey when it comes to multiple monitors. However, I have found that if you hit the option key while selecting the scale radio button you get more options for the 4k monitors.\n\nAlso unplugging the HDMI cable seemed to reset the Mac to recognize that the monitor supported more resolutions.\n\nA: It's possible to get the Larger text...More Space scaling slider for the Dell P2815Q by using the HDMI input rather than DisplayPort. I'm not sure why, but swapping the connections over yields this settings panel:\n\nThat's a good start, but is also the end of the road. The scaled options are (unknown) -> 1280x720 -> 1920x1080 -> 3840x2160, so that mode doesn't provide any additional resolutions or scaling modes over the mini-DisplayPort and DisplayPort inputs.\nIt looks like (for now) there is no automatic way to scale the UI components in between 1920x1080 and 3840x2160, which is quite frustrating as one is too big while the other is too small. It's worth pointing out that this is only a problem if you're on the larger 4K screens and needing screen space: the P2815Q at 1920x1080 (scaled) is a great resolution to write on, but not so great as a software developer needing many windows on the same screen.\nA (pretty poor) workaround is to alter the font size of the applications you work with, but if you frequently unplug and work on the MacBook Pro retina screen you then need to switch them back.\n\nA: It seems that it depends on the model of the mac\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206587\nIt might be a marketing strategy to allow this feature on certain brands. My MacBook is retina, so it has \"HiDPI mode\" capability. Yet apple doesn't allow me to use this ready feature. They certainly know about it.\n", "Q: Time Machine fails to backup certain files A few months back I did a clean install of Yosemite, followed by restoration of user files via Time Machine. Weeks later, I was horrified to find that several dozen files (seemingly random) were missing post-restore. \nI manually checked for the missing files on the Time Machine backup, and they're not there; they were apparently never backed up, despite having existed on the source disk for years, and residing in folders with other files that were backed up just fine. These files were not on the \"exclusions\" list in TM; they were just ignored for some strange reason.\nSince I'm generally paranoid about backups, I keep multiple TM disks around, as well as a Carbon Copy clone and Backblaze. So I was able to manually restore the missing files. But only because I happened to notice they were missing in the first place. \nSince that experience I have taken to keeping a close eye on TM by occasionally comparing what makes it onto the backup vs what is ignored. Today, \ntmutil compare -n \n\nshows that yet again, I have a random list of files (different ones) that Time Machine is ignoring. I tried to \"touch\" each file to update the timestamp, followed by a manual TM run, and they are still ignored.\nWhat would cause Time Machine to leave certain files off of the backup schedule? Is there any way to debug this? At this point I have no faith at all in Time Machine, as a faulty backup is in some ways worse than none at all. \n\nA: The best way to debug this is with tmutil - since you mentioned using the touch command I'll briefly get others up to speed:\n\n\n*\n\n*open terminal app\n\n*open finder to show the folder with the files in question\n\n*type tmutil isexcluded and then drag in the files and/or folders in question\n\n\nOnce you know if an item is excluded, you can programmatically remove exclusion or addexclusion as desired. The Time Machine preference pane also has an options button that allows similar modification of the exclusion rules, but no capacity to see if a file will be excluded or not.\nMac:~ me$ tmutil isexcluded /Users/me/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com\\~apple\\~CloudDocs/Certificate.pdf \n[Included]  /Users/me/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Certificate.pdf\nMac:~ me$ tmutil isexcluded /Users/me/Library/Caches/1Password \n[Excluded]  /Users/me/Library/Caches/1Password\n\nOnce you're comfortable with whether a file is supposed to be backed up, a tmdiagnose analysis might be required. Either by you, or someone that has done that or via support with Apple.\n", "Q: Screen rotation bug and reset Poked at the system settings, display settings, and changed screen rotation setting to 180.\nImmediately after rotation setting became read only, and then after 30 seconds it crashed.\nAfter reboot i cant'go to system setting any more, it just says to me that it cant open display settings and hangs.\nNVRAM reset (options+cmd+R+P) does not reset screen rotation setting, only everything else.\nSo.

It does work on a Windows machine. I know that to fix this problem one needs to connect the VGA to the Mini Display port (via an adapter of course). So is there another way around this? Or do we have to connect to the Mini Display port. \n\nA: Being that VGA is an analog signal, and (Mini) DP / HDMI are both digital signals, an adapter will be required. \nGiven that you wanted a solution that used HDMI, a powered HDMI port is necessary, which is not be included with the MBP, in addition Apple does not support such a configuration:\n\n\nCan the HDMI port drive analog displays (VGA displays, for example) using adapters?\n    No. The HDMI port will only drive digital connections (such as DVI) using the adapter that came with the Mac. The HDMI port cannot be used for analog displays such as VGA. You can purchase a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter separately to drive analog displays.\n\n\nI would think you need to do with the Mini DP converter, if VGA output is necessary. Alternatively, it is possible to get a more expensive powered active converter.\n\nA: On my 2014 MacBook Pro with 2 Thunderbolt ports I found HDMI port to HDMI-VGA adapter did not work, but if I used my Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter then plugged the HDMI to VGA adapter into that, the VGA signal to the external monitor worked fine. Neither adapter are Apple branded, just generic.\nI also had to turn off Dynamic Switching of the graphics cards (I use gfxCard Status 2.3) and use Discrete Only to prevent flickering on and off of both monitors. It still happens occasionally, but it's bearable.\nEDIT: After a while the Macbook Pro intermittently stopped powering the external display, leading to both displays flickering on and off more often. Maybe I will try an Apple adapter or a different monitor with HDMI input.\n\nA: I don't know which product you have, but I own an Insignia HDMI to VGA adapter. There's a micro-USB port on the adapter which I need to plug into a power source, and it then works.\nI just plug it into my computer for the power and have a USB hub on the other side for my USB needs.\n\nA: After a few months of experimentation, we found no 3rd party (i.e., non-Apple branded) HDMI <> VGA adaptors which worked well and some which didn't work at all on our Macs. We bit the financial bullet and purchased Apple-branded adaptors and they work perfectly.\nWe found the same with Thunderbolt & USB <> gig-Ethernet adaptors and Lightning <> HDMI adaptors, too. Remember, you may save $$ purchasing 3rd-party adaptors, but there are tradeoffs in either operation or quality, frequently both.\nMost 3rd party adaptors have little or no strain or twist relief in the cable attachment inside the adaptor. We had slews of non-Apple Thunderbolt <> VGA adaptors die after only a week or two of use because the cables literally twisted out of the adaptor body.\n\nA: I also have an HDMI to VGA adapter and it doesn't work on my Mac, it does on my Raspberry Pi, haven't tried a PC yet.\nThere is a high probability that its Apple's System Integrity Protection that's stopping 3rd party adapters from working. \nThis can be disabled, see How to Disable System Integrity Protection (rootless) in Mac OS X.\nI was attempting to get a USB to Ethernet adapter working on my MacBook Pro 2015 running El Capitan and it wouldn't work. I disabled this feature and added the driver for the adapter and it worked. See How to use a Generic USB 2.0 10/100M Ethernet Adaptor RD9700 on Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan.\nThere was a down side though, after this was installed the adapter caused my mac to crash twice. It was causing Kernel panics and wouldn't start hence the name System Integrity Protection.\nSince I've restored without it I haven't had problems, it could of been the driver so you could just disable System Integrity Protection and see if it works.\n\nA: I found ICY BOX model IB-AC502 HDMI to VGA connector and works on my MacBook Pro 13 Retina, model 2015. The connector costs about 25EUR.\n\nA: A third party DVI-D to HDMI cable worked just fine. Unfortunately no luck with the VGA cable. \n\nA: Please use Thunderbolt connector\n.\n\nA: I can confirm the answer of user3735534 works. \nHere's what happened in my case. I used to have a Toshiba laptop with VGA port to connect to my VGA monitor. When I upgraded to Mac Book Pro, I gave away the Toshiba but not the VGA monitor.\nI purchased an HDMI to VGA adaptor. The brand is Sandberg. It's a small square plastic box which has the HDMI cable protruding on one end and the VGA slot on the other end. This adaptor also has a small slot on one side for the micro-usb. \nAfter connecting the HDMI and VGA, Mac Book Pro detected a second display (in settings, I could choose to mirror or extend the display). But the VGA monitor stayed black - no display at all. I used the micro-usb port of the adaptor and plugged the USB end to my Mac Book Pro. The VGA monitor then came to life. Now I'm using it as an extended display.\n", "Q: How to use Defaults to set an element of an array of an array in a preference file? I am trying to increase the speed of the Text-To-Speech on my Mac.  The GUI Preference pane maxes out at 360 words per minute.

It looks like it is showing you the code of PDF files instead of rendering them as PDF files. My guess is you've either installed a QuickLook plugin that is doing this, or you've installed an application with a QuickLook plugin that is handling files instead of the default plugins.\nThere are three folders for QuickLook plugins.

I'm having a very strange problem with Mail on a new iMac which is running 10.10.3.  The Apple store migrated the user's home files over from an old MacBook, which was running Snow Leopard, and everything worked fine for a few weeks.  Then the problem appeared: Mail wouldn't show any windows when starting.  The program was clearly running; the menu bar showed \"Mail\" and a dot appeared under Mail's Dock icon.  Also, Mail's \"window\" menu had entries for \"Inbox\" and two message windows which were open the last time Mail was shut down.  The weird thing was that choosing \"Enter Full Screen\" from the View menu actually worked; the Inbox window would appear full-screen, and I could then choose \"Exit Full Screen\" and the Inbox window would appear normally.  Quitting and restarting Mail made the problem happen again, though - no window appeared.\nApple's chat and phone support have had me deleting plist and lock files from various locations, but no joy.  They have actually talked the user through two complete reinstallations of Yosemite, which took 24 hours each time as her net connection is very slow.  They have said something very odd, which I doubt is correct: they think the problem with Mail may have been caused by me copying files over from another Mac.  Here's what I did: I made a subdirectory in her Documents folder and copied everything from the home directory of another user on a Mac Mini to that subdirectory.  I did this to preserve those files as the Mini is old and the user wants to get rid of it.  \nI don't see how copying files - no matter what files - to a subdirectory in Documents could possibly have broken Mail's ability to display its window when starting up.  Mail is fixed now, after two reinstallations of Yosemite, but I haven't copied the files over again.  Apple's support guy is recommending that she buy a new backup drive and copy the files to that instead.  I don't like this for two reasons: one, it means spending more money, and two, the files won't be backed up as they would be if we kept them on her iMac.  \nCan you think of anything which could have caused Mail to stop showing its window only when first started, or any way in which copying files over could have caused it?  Can you offer any insight into this weird problem?\nUpdate: After a trip to the Apple store where the staff reinstalled Yosemite yet again, Mail is working normally.  But here's the kicker: a few weeks later, Safari started doing exactly the same thing - no window appears when you run the program, but entering full screen makes it appear, and exiting full screen then works properly.

What action can I take to get my rates back up?\n\nOSX 10.10.3; Airport Extreme 802.11ac (7.7.3). I've tried restarting the AirPort, and powering off/on, as well as manually assigning channels. The AirPort has not changed location, nor have any objects between it and the devices where I'm measuring the signal. Moving closer to (leaving the room where I've always worked and moving next to) the AirPort does get the lastTxRate back up to values I'm used to.\nHere's what I see in iStumbler:\n\n\nA: Issues with Wi-Fi are notoriously difficult to diagnose. It's possible that there's increased traffic in the area for some untold reason, causing contention, and forcing the connection to fall to a lower MCS index (lower indexes deal better with interference, but result in lower performance, which is what you're seeing). Often the issues go away on their own, sometimes they don't. You'd probably have to take a survey of the neighborhood to get any reliable information as to what's changed that could be causing this. It's theoretically possible that you may have too many devices connected to your router, but it's unlikely. Unless you're actively using them all at once, there shouldn't be much contention. You could try disconnecting all your devices from the network, except for your Mac, and see if that makes the problem go away. \n\nA: Maybe someone else is using your internet? If your network is password protected, probably not.

Nothing happens to it. \nLet me know, how to resolve it. \n\nA: There is no evidence of any malware from the output of your discoveryd normally running daemon.\nYour pkill -f 6115 command failed because luckilly you don't have a process which full command name would be 6115. This is the sign of too fast reading the pkill documentation and not at all of an attack.\nIf you really want to kill discoveryd here is the correct way to do it:\n_pid_to_kill=`ps ax | egrep '[ /]discoveryd' | awk '{print $1}'`\nif [ \"${_pid_to_kill}\" ] ; then\n    /usr/bin/sudo kill ${_pid_to_kill}\nfi\n\n_pid_to_kill will get the process id of discoveryd if it is actually running.\nLine 2 will test if this variable is set with something, and line 3 will do the dirty job.\n\nA: Here's a link to the Apple Beta Software Program site. Sign up for the program and follow the site's instructions to upgrade your computer to OS X 10.10.4, whose latest beta (build 14E26a) got rid of discoveryd in favor of bringing back mDNSResponder.\n\nA: If you don't want to risk running unstable beta software, you can try transplanting a 10.9 version of mDNSresponder to 10.10 replacing discoveryd. Nothing failed to work after this patch.\n", "Q: Do all iPad mini models have SIM slots? I currently have an iPad mini 2 WiFi/Verizon.

Do I have to buy a Verizon model, or can I buy a so-called \"WiFi-only\" model and use my SIM?\nThanks all.\n\nA: WiFi-only Apple devices do not contain a SIM card tray, unfortunately.\n", "Q: How to find wifi passwords in Yosemite or iOS8 I can still connect to this foreign network using this new computer -- my old computer had access. I want to share the password with my wife's system.\nI can't figure out how to do this, either in Yosemite or iOS8.\nI've looked at this question among others. Keychain Access doesn't seem to hold wifi passwords any longer. (I've used this method in the past).\nHas anyone else seen this? Am I looking incorrectly or is there a new location/method?\nThanks\n\nA: Keychain Access still stores the passwords: \nGo to Applications > Utilities and open the Keychain Access app. On the left side field, click \"System,\" and in the left field \"Category\" click \"Passwords\". From here, you can double-click on each network in the \"Name\" column, and click the \"Show password\" box to show the network password. You may have to enter your Mac's Username/Password to view each Network Password.\nI'm not aware of any way to do this direct from iOS 8, but your iOS passwords will be stored here as well. If you don't see them, on your iOS device, go to Settings > iCloud > Keychain, and turn on \"iCloud Keychain\" if it isn't already. Apple may text you a security code to verify this: Enter the code on your iOS device. Your saved Wi-Fi passwords should show up shortly, but you may have to close and re-open Keychain Access.\n\nA: You can see saved passwords on iOS8 by going to:\nSettings->Safari->Passwords & Autofill->Saved Passwords.\nYou then need to enter you passcode.\nScroll to the entry of interest and select it.\nThis will show you the Username and Password.\n", "Q: Iphone 5s stuck in headphone mode I have a pair of Sol headphones that would always fit into my iphone until recently I realized that my iPhone didn't have any sound coming out of the internal speakers.\nIt was my headphone jack that is causing the issues and i just cleaned it out but now its not working and the sol headphones I mention just don't fit into my iPhone. I barely get the tip in and nothing else can go through and im not trying to force it in. \nHow do i fix this? \n\nA: If there is nothing physically jammed into the headphone jack then it should be easily fixable. \nThis happens to me occasionally when sound refuses to play out the external speakers and the simplest solution is to restart your phone by holding down the sleep button until it says slide to power off. Then, restart it by either plugging it in to a power source or holding the sleep button for an extended few seconds.\nOn the other hand if this doesn't work and the piece logged in there is the problem, try cleaning out the jack using things such as tweezers or compressed air. If all else fails, turn it in the the nearest Apple Store ( via in person or by mail ) and have them take a look at the device in person.\nHope this helped!\n\nA: First solution: Perform a soft reset/reboot your iPhone \nSecond solution: Reset all settings on your iPhone\nThird solution: RecoveryTool Fix Recovery\n\nA: Solution that worked for me -  the simplest way is to schedule an alarm which will trigger after 10 or 15 mins and do a hard reset by pressing the home button and the power button at the same time. Once the alarm gets triggered , let it go on for 5 or 10 mins, after that click on the volume up / down button to see whether ringer volume pop up is displayed instead of headphones. If it is getting displayed immediately open your music app and play a song to see that the sound is redirected to the speaker. \n", "Q: How can you put new songs from a computer to an apple device after you wiped the computer and it counts as a new one? I recently wiped my computer without backing it up because it was overwhelmed by viruses, and I just bought a new CD, which I planned to put on my iPad 2. The only problem is that the computer is now recognized as a new computer, and wants to erase all my non-apple bought content. Is there any way to avoid this?\n\nA: You can use a product like iExplorer to first copy your music off of the iPad on to the computer.  Then use the copied music to rebuild iTunes and then when the music on the iPad gets wiped it won't matter as it will get replaced with what you copied to the computer and added to iTunes.\n", "Q: How can I get my own phone number from an iPhone running iOS 8?

The hard drive was removed, so I put in a new one and have been trying to install OS X Yosemite. However, whenever I boot the install media, be it a flash drive, hard drive, or DVD, the installation gets about 1/3 of the way through and then goes to a blank white or grey screen. When this happens, whatever install media it was reading from, it stops accessing, as if the system had halted. If I boot in verbose mode and look at the output, these are the last lines before the screen turns blank:\nfGPUIdleIntervalMS = 0\n[AGPM Controller] build GPUDict by Vendor1882Device6741\nDSMOS has arrived\n\nThis leads me to believe the issue lies with the GPU, but I am not sure how I could confirm this. I was able to install Windows 8.1 on this Mac, however I can't install the AMD nor Intel graphics drivers so I am unable to confirm if they are working that way. Is there anything else I can try? Any help is greatly appreciated.\nEdit:\nI was able to confirm that the GPU was at fault by installing OS X to a hard drive on another Mac, putting that hard drive in the MacBook Pro, and then booting to single user mode and entering the following:\ncd /System/Library\nmkdir ExtensionsDisabled\nmv Extensions/AMD* ExtensionsDisabled/\n\nThis prevented any kernel extension related to the AMD GPU from being loaded and forced the Mac to boot using the Intel GPU, which works as a temporary fix. The real fix is, as answered below, a new logic board, which Apple will replace for you.\n\nA: Some 2011 MBPs have a well-known GPU problem. So well-known, in fact, that Apple will replace your GPU for free! That link leads to Apple's page for their GPU replacement program.\n", "Q: Airdrop Name is Incorrect I have both an iPhone 6 Plus and a Macbook Pro, and both have Airdrop. On my iPhone, the name of my mac is correct, but on my mac, the name is of one of my contacts. The contact only has a name and a number, and has no other settings or connections added. On my phone, I have marked my own contact as \"me,\" but on my mac, it still shows the other contact. Only when I delete that contact does the Airdrop name change to the correct one. How do I permanently change my Airdrop name or fix this error?\n\nA: Step one on the Mac might be to sign out of iCloud. AirDrop uses that.\nBefore doing anything, make a full backup of the Mac. Then check for other user accounts on the Mac in system preferences. Once you're sure your account is the one doing the naming for airdrop, you can see if your iCloud contact details are correct and sign out (deleting any iCloud data on the Mac when prompted since that data is in the cloud) and then sign back in to iCloud.\nWorst case, once you've singed back in, check the Contacts app and check that \"your card\" is really your information.

It shows the latest iPhone backup as 08:42 which is the one that I want to restore to but it won't allow me to restore to it as it says iOS 8.3 Required.\nHow can I update it so that I can restore it? I could set it up as a new iPhone and then update it, but when I wipe it to get back to the restore screen I'll be in the same situation surely.\n\nA: I have realised that wiping the iPhone does not downgrade it, so it was as simple as setting it up as a new iPhone, updating it, wiping it, and then restoring.\nThis can all be done without a computer (as per my question), unlike the other answers.\n\nA: Just update on the iPhone.\nThen when you want to restore, connect to iTunes and \"restore from backup\" (your old phone), this brings back the latest backup data (w/o iOS) from your old phone.\n", "Q: Is there any way to upgrade brew cask Is there any way to upgrade all brew casks?

I tried removing the graphite with a nail file but it won't come out. \nWhat are my options at this point?\n\nA: Two options: Superglue / Toothpick, Apple Store\nWhat has worked for me in the past, is to use a toothpick and some superglue. \nDab one end of the toothpick into some superglue. Use as little as possible at first. Then very, very carefully, place the toothpick onto the graphite pencil tip that is stuck in the headphone jack. Hold the toothpick in place for about a minute or two, and then gently attempt to pull / remove the pencil tip. \nIf it remains stuck, try again, with a bit more superglue, and hold the toothpick in place for an extra minute or so. \nBe careful not to drip excess glue into the headphone jack. \nIf you can take your iPhone into an Apple Store and have a technician look at it, they may be able to remove the pencil tip with either tweezers, or condensed air. If they are unable to remove it, they may label it \"Accidental Damage\" and provide you with replacement options at a cost. \nAgain, the toothpick / superglue has worked for me in the past. However, in Apple's eyes, taking the iPhone into an Apple Store is the best bet. \n\nA: Try something like fishing line or insulated wire. The idea is to put it's end into the port, make it go around the tip and go out at it's other side (U shape).

Unfortunately this leaves lots of leftover files behind, which totally pisses me off, cause there is no way to make entirely sure that an application is completely removed from a system running OS X. I could do some manual system searches or I could use some third party app-remover, but even these methods can fail. And this have turned out to multiple problems inside a problem.\nSince discovering the amount of leftovers an application leaves, I’ve been trying to find applications I’ve previously installed by the drag-and-drop method, so that I could find those previous applications and fully remove them. I’ve found some of these. Not all of them though. Is there any log file or terminal commands etc. that can reveal all applications, software and extensions downloaded to the system?\nI’ve now ended up with even more problems. I might be a bit paranoid, but I fear that I might have deleted some system- or OS related file. Solutions to this problem might be a log file or terminal commands that reveals all items that’ve been either in the trash or deleted. Another solution could be a third party application that can tell if some OS X file is missing. Any suggestions?\nNow let us take this to next level. Cause not only is it quite a hassle to remove applications on the system － the system itself becomes a hassle. I’ve noticed that when updating/upgrading the OS on a Mac, the old OS files remain on the system. Meaning that with years passing by, you might end up with loads of unusable outdated OS files. Any clues to a solution?\nSo as you can see there is quite a lot of hassle in this area of the Mac, and I’ve lately thought of just wipping the hard drive and reinstalling the latest softwareupdates. Though this isn’t really a great solution as all of these problems would reappear at a later stage. Also I don't think it's possible to 100 % wipe a hard drive. And I don’t wanna turn my Mac into a “raw Mac” only running Apple software. So I was thinking that some of you geeks and Mac-knowers might be able to help me out on this one. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Wiping and starting over won't teach you what is causing each problem.\nSo, you can either decide to make a systematic approach to troubleshooting and isolating the issues you run into on your current setup and then attack them individually or you can punt and wipe.\nThe punt and wipe is actually quite effective at delaying any investment of time or energy into troubleshooting. Unless you keep running into the same issue, why do all the work to isolate it if you have an unlikely failure and complicated setup with the interaction between many pieces is causing the instability?\nIf you open Disk Utility - it shows you the count of folders and files. I have three Macs currently - and they have 1,678,502 and 1,936,355 and 1,666,050 files respectively. Trying to catalog that many millions of files would take ages. Ensuring I have a good Time Machine backup of all three, wiping them and setting up new user accounts would take me an hour or two at the most. (And much of that time could be spent watching youtube or netflix or knitting.)\nI'm not seeing the hassle you report maintaining things, but perhaps your software or tooling makes getting a rebuilt system working less efficient. \n", "Q: 2014 Mac Mini with two mDP-DP monitors I'm planning to upgrade from a 2011 base model Mac Mini to a 2014 high end Mini (2.8Ghz i5, Iris, 16GB ram) and wanted to see if I could drive two 2560x1600 monitors through the thunderbolt ports with two mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cables.\nSpecs from EveryMac don't specifically mention Mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort, but am I right to assume that Thunderbolt is pretty much identical to DisplayPort?\n\nThis model supports \"up to two displays\" at 2560x1600, both at millions of colors, via the two Thunderbolt 2 ports. It supports Thunderbolt digital video output and native Mini DisplayPort output as well as DVI, VGA, and Dual-link DVI using Mini DisplayPort to DVI, Mini DisplayPort to VGA, and Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapters.\n\nBased on other questions I’m 99% sure it works but just wanted to be absolutely certain!\n\nA: You will not be able to drive a Mac Mini to a monitor with a resolution of higher than  1920 x 1200 off of that HDMI port (different versions of HDMI have different capabilities vs. different versions of DP/mDP--the Mac version of HDMI is old). For 2560 resolution you must attempt to use the Thunderbolt ports to connect to the display mDP ports--in theory, although they are not identical, as the thunderbolt capabilities of data transfer are a superset of the mDP's, the thunderbolt port is backwards compatible with the mDP port and the Mac Mini will recognize the mDP monitors. Problems have been reported in practice in achieving full resolution for the mDP displays; there are also positive reports.\nsee: http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/digital-home/displayport-vs-hdmi-3535257/\nand:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204388\n", "Q: Google Inbox as a standalone app via Chrome Google Inbox recently added compatibility with Safari and yet still does not play nice with Fluid.\nI decided I might as well use Chrome. Google recently improved the way \"desktop app extensions\" work by giving them their own independent icons in Applications and Launchpad. \nUnfortunately, this is acting like a glorified bookmark, rather than a standalone app. I.e., it opens with a toolbar and opens the site as a tab. I tried exploring the \"contents\" of the application icon Google creates. I found a plist but could not figure out if there was away to force the app to open an independent standalone Chrome window.\nAny ideas on how I could modify the app to act less like a bookmark and more like a standalone desktop app ? \n\nA: Akmal has released Chrome App that does exactly this.\nYou could take a look at his code to see how he's done it.\nI would mention that he is running the webview through scan.me, so getting analytics to how many people are visiting it.\n\nA: This script will create an app from a website for you. \nThere is either an instalator or a shell script to enter the name, icon and url for your app to be shown in your default browser without toolbars.

You can create a new shortcut by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automater and create a Service with a single \"Run AppleScript\" action, containing the following code:\ntell application \"Finder\" to sleep\n\nMake sure the Service is set to receive \"no input\", and work in \"any application\". Save it with a name of your choosing.\n\n*Go into Keyboard preferences, click on the Shortcuts tab, and click on Services. The newly created service should be near the bottom. Click on the service, then click on \"add shortcut\", and specify a shortcut to your liking.\n\n*You may have to give Automator access by adding it to the list of applications in Accessibility under the Privacy tab in Security and Privacy.\nThat's it! Now you can use that shortcut from anywhere to sleep your Mac.\n\nA: I don't know how to map a key to the Eject key, but you can easily create a new shortcut with Automator and Services:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator in the Applications folder.\n\n*Choose Service:\n\n\n*Select Utilities and drag Run AppleScript to the right pane:\n\nConfigure, on the top right corner, that the service should receive no input in any application.

Use a descriptive name, as it is the name that will appear in the Services menu. You can see in the screenshot above that I named the service Lock Screen.\n\n*Open System Preferences, select Keyboard and then the Shortcuts tab. Under General locate Lock Screen and assign a key shortcut to it. As you can see, I chose ControlCommandL:\n\n\n*The Lock Screen service is now accessible from any application as an entry in the Services menu:\n\nChoose the service shortcut carefully to avoid conflicts with other applications' shortcuts.\n", "Q: View Keychain from encrypted IOS 8.2 backup?

Seems to happen when I'm doing something new (e.g. pausing a Youtube video, opening a new tab, changing volume). Another example, in MS Word, I'll be typing, see no words appear, continue typing, then all of a sudden everything appears at once and runs well. The app becomes nonresponseive, but I can still move the window. \nHas anyone experienced this or have any suggestions?\nMuch appreciated!\n\nA: I've been having this problem with my Mac Mini as well. I'm running with 10 gigs ran and just recently Secure wiped the entire disk and started over. Do you have this problem with safari? With the most recent glitchiness I have decided to try out Safari and it runs a whole lot smoother over there compared to Chrome.\nAlso are you using a disk drive or a solid-state drive in your Mac? I have a disk drive and I believe that's one reason why the Applications have been running a lot slower because whenever chrome is open it will attempt to cache its way all the way through your RAM no matter how much you have (recently I saw a complaint in a forum showing chrome had taken up 56 GB of their Mac pros ram). When chrome does this, you end up getting pushed into the swap area on your disk where disk drives really do struggle. \nMy guess for MS Word: Now that most of the modern machines or using solid-state drives, Developers are starting to safely assume that the user most likely will be using this as well and start sending resources back to the hard drive instead of RAM so they have more room to work with. This new method slows everything down as well if you're using a disk drive.\n", "Q: MacBook charger not working when laptop is on I am using original charger on MacBook Air.

Does Apple Mail under iOS support the ability to get the raw as-sent text of an email? Alternatively, is there a way to forward an email as an attachment?\nI'd like to be able to report spam email to Spamcop.net, but I need all the headers and the raw source of the email, not just a copy of the rendered results.\n\nA: Its 2021 and its still not possible with the built-in app! Nor with Outlook.\nThankfully Airmail does, even the free version. Open an email, tap the ... at the bottom (not the top one as that one didnt work for me) and then View Source.\nNote though that the free version will keep prompting you to purchase a subscription so its not a substitute. Also, and more importantly, the text size is quite small and the app doesn't allow you to zoom. You can copy the text if you must so there is that at least.\nThe second part to your question, sending email as attachment, Airmail does this as well.\nWhen I tested sending as attachment from Microsoft's 365 (using Airmail) to GMail, I couldn't view the attachment in either built-in Mail app or through the web browser. I got a message that emaill could not be downloaded. When I added my GMail to Airmail, I was able to open the attachment.\nAirmail to Outlook also worked in my tests.\n\nA: OK. I think I've got this figured out.\nFirst, you need to have access to a gmail account. Great if the original email is already address to one. Otherwise you'll need to forward to a gmail address (or an account that's accessible via Gmail).\nNext, open Gmail in a browser on your iOS device. I used Chrome, but that may not matter. Go to gmail.google.com and sign in to your account. It will likely take you to the mobile version. Scroll down the page and you should see Mobile | Older version | Desktop. You want Desktop.\nOnce there, open the email in question. Just under the address info for the email, you should see Reply, Reply all, Forward.... Show original. Click Show original and you should be golden.\n\nA: There is no way to do so directly from iOS Mail app, but you can forward it to another address which the corresponding client supports Show Original option.\nYou can always do this sort of things with Cydia tweaks, but if your did not jailbreak your device, the way we said before is the only possible way.\nNOTE: The best way is always waiting for the new versions.

When you click on it, it re-downloads the original from iCloud, and the pacman you see is the indicator that the original is being downloaded.\n", "Q: iPod Touch 5: Start new messages field doesn't show up http://i57.tinypic.com/30kysfl.jpp \nHi, my iPod Touch 5th gen dosent have the start new messages field, and its not there when I scroll down. Also, my iPhone's phone number wasn't an option when the field was there, only my emails.\n\nA: Is iMessage activated on your iPhone?\nIs your iPhone and iPod signed in with the same Apple ID and connected to the Internet?\nWithout activating iMessage on your phone with the same Apple ID you can't use the telephone number on your iPod.\nIf you can't use the phone number for iMessage on your iPhone, then try with turning iMessage off from the settings and turn it on again a few seconds later. Try doing that on the iPod as well.\n\nA: Assuming that you've not already done troubleshooting on your own, and assuming that the iPod is not provisioned in any way, here are steps that I would try in order until the issue is resolved. Be sure you have your Apple ID password handy or memorized:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure that the same Apple ID is being used for iMessage as on your iPhone and on your iPod. If either is different, log into the\n  Apple ID that you'd like to use on both devices. Otherwise, it will\n  not work.

I did set up separate email accounts but all their text messages are coming to me and they have access to my pics, contacts etc. I am not extremely tech savvy but there must be a way that they can have their own texting accounts and I can block access to my stuff? Please help!!!\n\nA: The term \"AppleID\" is being used here to refer to two different accounts and that's where it gets confusing.  Your actual Apple ID is what logs you in to the App Store, has your credit card linked and keeps track of your purchases.  The details are in the Settings App under \"iTunes & App Store\".  As @Gabkano said you can now use Family Sharing to put your kids' Apple IDs under yours so that if you buy an app, song, movie, etc they get it too without having to pay for it again.\nBut that's not why you and your kids are seeing each others' photos, contacts, iMessages, etc.  Those are all part of your iCloud account which also includes calendars, reminders, Safari bookmarks, and, if you've enabled it, password saving through Keychain.  The login details for that are in the \"iCloud\" tab of the Settings app just above the AppleID tab.  \nMost people use the same e-mail address for both the AppleID and the iCloud ID but you don't have to.  For example, my wife, kids and I all share a single AppleID but we each have our own iCloud accounts.  That way we only have to buy apps once but my contacts and such stay separate from hers and from the kids'. I also log my iPhone, iPad and Mac into my iCloud account so that all of my data is synced between them automatically. \nTo make matters even more confusing there's a third account that often gets lumped in with the AppleID: your Game Center ID, which tracks scores and achievements in games.  Your kids will almost certainly want their own GameCenter IDs so I suggest using the same email address there as your iCloud ID.  \nMaybe this will help:\n  Me:   AppleID=us@me.com, iCloud=dad@me.com,   GameCtr=dad@me.com\n  Wife: AppleID=us@me.com, iCloud=mom@me.com, GameCtr=mom@me.com\nWith Family sharing you can set up individual AppleIDs for everyone and link them together but for years I've been doing it the way I explained above and it's worked out very well. \nI hope this helps.\n\nA: Gabkano said it right. But the good thing is that you can set them up with different Apple IDs and that's no longer as much of a problem. Now that family sharing is a thing, your kids can enjoy the benefits of having the same Apple ID without actually needing the same Apple ID.\nI highly suggest Setting up their Apple IDs with something simple like their first name and last name because if it's something that they may grow out of later, the pains of changing an Apple ID are still very much alive and will make it hard for them to get everything out. \n", "Q: How do you make the dock more sensitive to being shown?

I found 0.4 suits me most.\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -int 0\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.4\nkillall Dock\n\n", "Q: Why an AVI video file cannot be imported to iMovie? I'm using iMovie and try to import a .avi file, 730.5MB. But iMovie keeps saying that \"None of the selected files or folders can be imported. Change the selection and try again.\"\nSmall .avi files created by my camera are able to be imported, but the 730.5MB one cannot, which was downloaded from Internet. Why can't it be imported? Is it because of its size too large?\n\nA: I can't tell you why some AVIs can be imported but this one can't, but if you know that the file itself isn't corrupt or anything, I can give you a remedy: Handbrake is an app that can convert almost any video format to MP4, which iMovie should definitely be able to handle. Open Handbrake, select your video file, enter the destination path you want if you don't like the default, and press Start to run the conversion. When it's done, see how iMovie reacts to the MP4. Good luck!\n\nA: It likely has less to do with the size of the file and more to do with the format in which the audio was encoded. I second the suggestion to download the free application HandBrake and encode the file as an .mov or an .m4v with aac audio. There are presets built into the app, which make it very simple to choose output formats that'll work with whatever hardware & software you're intending to use to play (or edit) the video. HandBrake, also, has advanced options that allow for more granular control of encodings and a fairly active user and development community forum for support. HandBrake is really the best option for maintaining quality while reencoding any video files not of one's own creation and can also be used to rip video directly from disc; there are a number of lighter weight and more simplistic options if you needed to only remux the file.\n\nA: I would suggest just downloading \"Any Video Converter Lite\" from the app store and using it to push out a quick mp4 file. Its solid and takes barely any configuring in order to get a workable output. I highly recommend it.\n", "Q: Mirror parts of screen to external monitor I'd like to mirror/clone separate parts of my iMac screen to smaller external displays. \nFor me the best solution would be to draw a frame on top of the iMac display and let that special frame show up on a smaller external display.\nIs this possible? How can I do this?\n\nA: There are tools for doing this which are visual aids like zooming and following the mouse around, maybe they might work?\n", "Q: Some of my Safari bookmarks don't appear in Spotlight search results When doing a spotlight search for my bookmarks, some of them appear in the search result but some don't. I was not able to find a pattern about which ones will show up and which ones won't. Newly added bookmarks are found but some older ones aren't.\nI've looked in ~/Library/Caches/Metadata/Safari/Bookmarks and found two interesting things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some old bookmarks (no more present in Safari) have a webbookmark file in this folder\n\n*Some existing bookmarks in Safari don't have an existing webbokmark file there\n\n\nI tried to rebuild the Spotlight index but the same bookmarks are missing.\nThe quite basic \"Edit bookmarks\" menu in Safari doesn't provide any advanced option to manage the bookmarks database further.\nIs there a way to force Spotlight to refresh the bookmarks part of its index? Unless it's on safari side that something has to be done?\nI have also seen that bookmarks data are stored in ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist. Which location is the correct one? From where does Safari get its bookmarks? ANd then, what is the purpose of the other location?\nI have iCloud for Safari enabled (as I want to share my bookmarks on my iPad and iPhone). It may be another parameter in the problem. However, I don't want to deactivate/reactivate it without being sure I won't loose my bookmarks as I don't know which one will be the master (local/iCloud) and not really knowing the content of my iCloud bookmarks.\n\nA: The ~/Library/Caches/Metadata/Safari/Bookmarks contains bookmarks that get updated by Safari every time you start it. If you look at the date, you will see it only contains the current date.\n\n\n*\n\n*Spotlight will only show bookmarks that have been updated by Safari in that folder. If for some reason a bookmark is not updated it will not show in Spotlight.\n\n\nThe ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist does contains bookmarks that are readable in plain text, that file is intended to manage the bookmarks organization.\n\n\n*\n\n*Spotlight will not search inside this file.\n\n\nPotential fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove current bookmarks in ~/Library/Caches/Metadata/Safari since the Safari itself would be unaffected by the removal of the contents and will rebuild it; as I understand it, those files exist to allow Spotlight searches to include bookmarks. \n\n*Close Safari and move the Bookmarks.plist file to Desktop and restart Safari. Now all bookmarks are gone in Safari it self. Move the Bookmarks.plist back where it was and restart Safari and you will have all bookmarks back.\n", "Q: Don't see messages from one specific sender any longer I am having a problem with Messages. Suddenly my iPhone stopped showing messages from a single contact (messages from other contacts are receiving fine). I did tried restarting my iPhone couple of times but this process was not as sufficient as it may.\nSo can you please tell me how to fix this problem?\n\nA: I am guessing the original poster does not need this answer any longer, but I found the answer after having this same problem for months, so perhaps posting here will help others resolve it more quickly. Open your text stream to the sender for whom you are not getting alerts. In the upper right hand corner, you will see a \"Details\" Link. Click that, and then look for the Do Not Disturb Switch. If that is green (switched on), then you will not receive alerts from that user. The killer thing about this is that you are most likely to accidentally switch this on for someone whom you text often. It is no fun when the only person for whom you don't receive text notifications is the person you most need to hear from, like perhaps a spouse . . .. Glad I got this corrected. \n\nA: Maybe you blocked the sender by mistake. To check if that is the case, you can go to Settings > Messages > Blocked.\n\nIf your contact is there, you can tap Edit and unblock him.\nIt could also be that you are filtering iMessages from people not on your contact list:\n\nIn iOS 8.3 and later, you can filter out iMessages from people who aren't saved in your contacts. Go to Settings > Messages and turn on Filter Unknown Senders. When you open Messages, you'll see a new tab for Unknown Contacts.\nWhen you turn on this option, you won’t get notifications for iMessages from Unknown Senders.\n\n\nMore info here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201229\n", "Q: Any way to prevent a notification from appearing in Notification Center?

The Apple Watch shows the temperature on the clock face. \nWhen my Apple Watch is disconnected from my iPhone, the temperature display becomes disabled, but the time is still displayed. That leads me to think the watch doesn't have a temperature sensor, but it getting it from the Internet. \nMy question is: How does the Watch get the temperature?\n\nA: The Apple watch doesn't have a temperature sensor for external temperature. \nIt probably uses the same web service as the Weather app. \n\nA: The temperature shown does come from the Weather App. Small bits of data on the watch face are known as complications.\nTapping the temperature on the watch face will open the Weather app thus revealing the source of the data.

I'm just curious and want to understand it\nDo I still have to worry that I lost some data?\n\nA: Your main disk uses a Core Storage partition scheme:\n\n*\n\n*disk0 is your main system disk.\n\n*disk1 is a \"virtual\" disk residing in disk0s2 containing the Macintosh HD volume visible on your desktop.\n\nThe first two sectors of a Logical Volume contain zeros only.\nExamples:\n\n*\n\n*disk2 is the Core Storage Volume pooling disk0s2 (SSD) and disk1s2 (HDD) of a 3.1 TB Fusion Drive\n\n\n\n*disk2 is the Core Storage Volume residing in disk0 - the 64 GB disk image of a Parallels VM (Yosemite)\n\nWith your command sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1024 count=1 you had luck and you just have overwritten 1024 zeros with 1024 zeros.\nAs a result you haven't lost any data and may continue working with your Mac without the need to restore any backup or to reinstall your system.\n\nA: You should be fine, and you got really lucky because you failed your way into saving your disk. I'll first break down your dd command:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk1\nCopy everything from zero to /dev/rdisk1 (your main disk, ouch!)\nbs=1024 \nSets the size of the blocks to be copied. In this case, you are coping in 1Kb blocks. This is more important in the next bit.\ncount=1\nThis argument is what saved your entire disk. When you set count to 1, you effectively told dd to only copy 1 block. Since your block size is 1Kb full of zeros, your dd command would have zeroed out the first kilobyte of your drive.\nWhile I have no idea what's in the first area on a drive, I would speculate that it holds the drive structure information. So, my recommenced action to take is reboot into recovery and launch Disk Utility and run \"Repair Disk\" on your system drive.\n", "Q: Why does storing photos on iCloud also consume storage space on iPhone? If I have all my pictures stored on the iCloud, why are they taking up so much room on my phone? I thought the iCloud was designed to free up storage on your actual device? \n\nA: Even when your photos are stored in iCloud, the Photo app will still have a low resolution version of the image on the iPhone so that you can see what photos you have in the cloud. These images are quite small, but will still consume space on your iPhone. If you have selected 'optimise iPhone storage' the app will try to intelligently select photos the be available on your phone (possibly recent pictures, maybe ones you have looked at several times etc).\nAll these things will take some space ... but it will be a fraction of the space all of the full resolution pictures would take.\n\nA: The process for optimizing space is a black box and don't expect it to conform to your expectations and desires. It's going to try to use as much space on your phone as it views as prudent before it starts replacing the original photos with the low-res versions.\nOne action you can take is to turn-off iCloud Photo Library on your phone and let it delete everything (it takes time so be patient) and then turn it back on. That will re-download all the low-res versions. That will give you a starting point of all low-res photos but eventually you'll be back in the same spot as you take new photos with your iPhone. I've done it and it does work but I've got multiple backups and it was still scary.\n\nA: Go to iCloud settings and then go from optimize storage to download and keep originals keep the ones you want and disable photos on iCloud and the manage iCloud and storage .\n", "Q: Remove everything from Mac and reinstall OS X Is it possible to delete everything from my Mac and then install OS X from a bootable USB? I don't why but somehow AudioAUUC extension was modified a few months ago and my sound isn't working since then. That's why I would like remove everything and install a fresh OS X.\n\nA: You don't necessarily have to remove everything to repair OS X\nDepending on OS X version you can just reboot holding the R key, to boot into the recovery partition. Alternatively you can hold alt/option to display current boot options and select your recovery partition.\nOnce in the recovery partition, you can use Disk Utility to erase your OS X partition if you want to wipe everything, or you can just select \"Reinstall OS X\" from the main menu. This will reinstall OS X system files and leave your home directory, settings, documents, etc alone. I'd recommend trying just the reinstall of OS X first, and if this doesn't work to fix your issue, proceed to erase your OS X partition and then reinstall OS X.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make a backup of your files/settings\n\n*Boot into the OS X Installer\nIf you need to create a bootable USB installer, see the Apple KB article\n\n*Open Disk Utility and erase the disk\n\n*Use the OS X Installer to install OS X\n", "Q: Time Capsule on Public Network I have an Apple Airport Time Capsule 3 TB that I want to connect to the ethernet network (not wi-fi) at my university so that several of my Macs can use it to backup to via Time Machine.\nI am currently directly connected to the time capsule via an ethernet cable. So far I have disabled wi-fi and enabled bridge mode since the device will only be used over ethernet and will be obtaining an IP Address over the network via our university DHCP server, just as any normal PC would do.\nEvery device first needs to be registered with our IT department which simply involves sending them the device MAC Address, hostname, and owner. So, my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I obtain the Time Capsule MAC Address? I do not see it listed\nin AirPort Utility while connected to the capsule via an ethernet\ncable.\n\n*How do I configure the capsule so that only specific Macs can use it\n    to backup to? There needs to be some type of authentication.\n\n*Should I connect the capsule to the network via its WAN port or its\n    LAN port?\nThanks\n\nA: To answer your first question, you hold control and option together and then double click on the Time Capsule in Airport Utility. On the summary page you will see a bunch of stuff, but under where it says \"Version: XXXXX\" you will see that it shows MAC addresses for all of the interfaces \nSecondly, the TC by default restricts backups to only computers that have the password which can be set under the disk tab\n\nI don't really understand your third question, but if it means what I think it does, you should connect over the LAN port because while using the internet jack does work, I found it causes instability within the network.\n", "Q: Select different credit card for work related App store purchase I'm using my personal laptop & iCloud account for my work as a software developer. My company would pay for a separate laptop but I choose to use my own for convenience. Also, saves me the trouble of not having to re-purchase some of the 100 or so apps and copy over settings, etc.\nGoing forward, is it possible to add a new credit card to my iCloud account (my work spending account card) and choose this card when I buy apps strictly related to my work and my personal card for all other purchases?\nI'm trying to avoid having to create a new iCloud account just to keep the purchases separate. If that's the only way, would it make sense for me to add my own work account as a \"family account\" so that I can share purchases with my original account?\n\nA: I just found this on Google searching for the same thing. I wanted to buy a $50 app that I'm using exclusively for work purposes (Things 3), and wanted to use my business card to feed it into Quickbooks and write it off.\nUnfortunately, as of today, you're going to have to create a separate Apple ID associated with your business/business credit card. I'm a developer so I basically already had one set up to develop iOS apps with my business card.\nOnce you do that, on Mac OS, in the App Store app, just hit Store -> Sign Out, and then sign in with your business Apple ID - buy your app - and then switch back.\nApple should make this easier but I bet the number of people buying business related apps that they want to write off is like 1% given the number of people using it for personal purposes.\nAs far as like, sharing the apps between your accounts - that I'm not sure about. Once I bought this app, it just works, and lives on my Macbook. The family account sounds like a solid option to explore.\nHope that helps you!\n", "Q: How to enable \"Click-to-play\" in Google Chrome Version 43.0.2357.124 (64-bit)?

I suspect what's happened is your Mac cannot recognize the NTFS formatted portion of the disk. \nReboot while holding Alt + Cmd + R for Internet Recovery Mode. Go to Utilities > Terminal, and in terminal type: diskutil cs list, then find the UUID under \"Logical Volume Group\" with the missing space, copy it, and paste it after: diskutil cs delete. Go back to Disk Utility. At the prompt, click \"OK\" to repair your Fusion Drive. Exit Disk Utility, reboot (to the recovery partition if it doesn't automatically, to Internet Recovery Mode, or using a recovery USB drive) and reinstall OS X. When that finishes: If you plan on restoring from a Time Machine backup, you may have to create a new User and recover your old account logged in as the new one. If this does not work, you may have to manually reformat each drive, and proceed from step one. \n", "Q: How do I extract the contents of a specified text field within a webpage using applescript?

One of our employees is preparing to leave the organization.  She will be turning in her iPhone and is requesting that we remove all of the data from it.  Not a problem, Settings > General > Reset > Erase all Contents & Settings will do the trick.\nHowever, she has recommended that we leave a voicemail greeting (the clip people hear when they reach your voicemail) with a notice that the caller should call our main number rather than wait on a response from her phone number.  This makes sense, but I'm not sure if that greeting will be wiped as well when we clear her phone.\nI suspect that the greeting is stored on the carrier's end, rather than locally on the iPhone, but I'd like to check first.  Does anyone know for sure?\n\nA: Make back up.\nScan your Mac to locate iPhone backups. Then locate the voicemail greeting by going to this location:\nSystem Files/Home Domain/Library/Voicemail\n\nInside the Voicemail folder locate the greeting.amr file. Select it and click the Export button to save a copy on your Mac’s Desktop. Double-click this file to listen to it to make sure it’s the file you want to retrieve. If so, you’re now ready to restore this file to your iPhone.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure the outgoing voicemail message is stored in the carriers network .... If you take the SIM card out of a phone (as long as you keep paying the bill) the voicemail message doesn't disappear, so I can't see why you can't reset all the settings on the phone.... the only variation to this may be if you are using visual voicemail (but I am not sure any carrier still supports this).\n", "Q: I think there are leftovers from previous OS X versions on my HD, how can I find/delete those?

I keep live update turned off on most of my smart playlists because changing anything, such as ratings, for a currently playing song could cause the song to disappear from the playlist if it no longer meets the smart playlist's criteria.  The song stops playing and the playlist grinds to a halt.  So far, the easiest solution has been to have an Applescript run automatically in the middle of the night to quit iTunes and then launch it again, thus forcing all of my smart playlists to update.  This works.  It's also easy enough to right click on a smart playlist and select \"Update Smart Playlist.\"  But what I'd rather do is use an Applescript to refresh all of my smart playlists and assign it a hotkey (using BetterTouchTool).\nIs it possible to use Applescript to make iTunes smart playlists update?\n\nA: Update Smart Playlist entry only resides in contextual menu; applescript cannot access that. There are two work-arounds I can think of: 1. BTT: hover over the playlist and invoke a combo right-click -> u -> return. Or:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"iTunes\"\n    set frontmost to true\n    repeat 2 times\n        tell menu item \"Edit Smart Playlist\" of menu \"File\" of menu bar 1 to perform action \"AXPress\"\n        tell checkbox \"Live updating\" of window 1 to perform action \"AXPress\"\n        tell button \"OK\" of window 1 to perform action \"AXPress\"\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nA: Credit here goes to the answer above, by fartheraway.  I just thought it could be helpful to post the full answer in case anyone does a search for something like this and finds my question.  Here's the solution I ended up going with.  Save this as an applescript and then assign it a hotkey using BetterTouchTool.  This script will update the currently playing smart playlist.  And if iTunes isn't the frontmost app, this script will switch to iTunes, update the playlist, and then take you back to app you were using (command+tab).  This works for me!

For example if I close mail, then Cmd+Tab to mail, it does nothing.\nThe alternative is to try and remember to Cmd+H to hide a window vs. closing it, but seems odd that it appears in Cmd+Tab at all if selecting that app does nothing and you have to open it from the dock anyway.\n\nA: If you close the window and with the red X then it is closed. If you minimise the window the it should open. So try minimising it instead. Also, when you closed the window and the application still is running then there sometimes is a keyboard shortcut to reopen the window. Remember that you need to be 'focusing' on the application to be able to do keyboard shortcuts that affect that application. To see which application you are  'focusing' on is shown in the upper left corner of the screen.\nEDIT: Tried this with the OS X Yosemite built-in mail.app and I was able to reopen the window of the application by pressing the key combination Alt+Cmd+N when I switched to it via Cmd+Tab. This was in tested in Yosemite, remember that it may differ with other versions of Mac OS X.\n\nA: If you press cmd + tab, select the app (arrow or mouse) and then press 1 or arrow up it opens the window(s) in a preview style. Pretty handy if you have a app with lots of windows. You can click on the desired window to open.\nThis also seems to work if you have minimised the window with the green button.\nTested in Yosemite\n\nA: Press cmd+tab, repeat to select the icon of the closed application you want to activate and press left alt, while keeping cmd+tab pressed.\nNot the most convenient shortcut, but for some reasons that's how it works.\n\nA: This sequence restore the standard message viewer window from Mail when it has been minimized or not:\ncmd ⌘+tab →|cmd ⌘+→ or ←(release cmd ⌘)cmd ⌘+0\nThis receipe is Mail version dependant.\nIt would be much more efficient to define an application independant function which could be:\nUnminimize     ⇧⌘M\nif you feel this might be a useful function, then make a suggestion to Apple:\nApple MacOS feedback\n", "Q: 2009 Macbook not booting up I found a white plastic/ rubber 2009 Macbook in the IT Office of my school  and was given permission to try to get it to be usable again.

I tried resetting the SMC as per that Apple website instructions, and this also does not work.\nIs there any way that I could get the computer to boot up into the operating system?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.  \n\nA: Did you reset both the SMC and PRAM (instructions is on the same support page at the Apple website)?\nIf you did, try it once again.\nDid you try all of the things in your post with both the power adapter and on battery?\nSince the machine is old and there is no support warrant left at Apple I don't think there is any idea to contact them.\nOtherwise, you may have found the reason to why it was just laying around at the IT office.\n\nA: Since the computer seems to have a firewire port, you could try booting it up in Target Disk Mode (keep the T key pressed while booting). Basically, this means you will be booting this Mac from another Mac's hard drive. The main aim of the exercise is to make sure the rest of the computer is OK, you just have an OS corruption or bad hard drive.\nAlternatively, if you can find an old Mac OS-X install DVD, you could also try to boot from that (keep the C key pressed). \n", "Q: Problem of My Photo Stream If I delete a photo from my photo stream using my phone, then it will be automatically deleted from other devices using same Apple ID or not?\n\nA: Yes, it will be deleted from all other devices (that is logged in with the same Apple-ID) Photo Stream too. But if the photo also is in the Camera Roll then it won't be deleted from there.\nPhoto Stream is like a album that is synced between all of your devices over iCloud.

It is a complete mess, e.g. a sent mail can be appended to another sent mail's header from a different account, or, a sent mail can appear in the midst of a group of mails sent to an entirely different address. I have searched but not found anyone else who is reporting the same problem. Please help?\n\nA: Open your Mail app preferences. Make sure you are using following setting.\n\nThis way your Sent email is always going to be from the currently selected email account.\nOpen one of the Sent mail folders. In there add the \"From\" to double check.\n", "Q: Gray Screen on Boot After getting some kernel panics and failing to fix it, I decided to reinstall OS X. It now boots but gets stuck on a gray screen with the Apple logo.\nThe odd thing is I can boot into single user mode (CMD+S) but not safe mode (Shift).\n\nA: Hold down CMD + R as you restart until you get to Mac OS X Utilities. Click Disk Utility > Click the Hard Drive, and then Your Hard Drive's Name if displayed underneath. Click \"Verify Disk,\" and wait until it completes. Click \"Repair Disk\" if available. Restart. \nIf you see the same gray screen after reboot, restart while holding CMD + S. You when you see a black and white screen, wait until the command prompt appears, and type: fsck -fy and hit enter. You'll see one of two messages: \"OK\" or \"FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED.\" If you see the \"OK\" message, type: reboot, and proceed to the next step if needed. If you see the \"FILE SYSTEM. . .\" message, press the up arrow and hit enter (to run the fsck -fy command again).\nHopefully after trying the fsck -fy command the first or several times, you got the \"OK\" message, and either restarted to a usable system, or: Restart again holding CMD + Option + R to enter Recovery mode again. From here, you can try running a repair from Disk Utility again, or reinstall OS X.\nRecommended: If you aren't already, plug in an Ethernet cable. Reinstalling OS X over Wi-Fi can take a while. \nFrom Disk Utility, click \"Reinstall Mac OS X,\" and follow the onscreen prompts.\nHope this helped. If you have any questions or get stuck, please let me know.

In Safari on OS X via Safari/Preferences/Passwords/ it is possible to view all saved passwords in plain text by entering the Mac password.\nI want to use a different password. Is this possible?\nI know that it is possible to change the password used to access the Keychain app via this method: Mac OS X, passwd, and keychain, however it does not change the behaviour in Safari as mentioned above. My ideal situation is for Keychain to manage all my passwords across all my devices and autofill them, without revealing them in plain text to someone who knows my device passwords.\nRELATED: How to prevent keychain passwords being seen with iPhone passcode? the same problem on iOS.\n\nA: If you want to avoid the default behaviour, which is a reasonable setting for a computer that allows multiple accounts, including guest accounts, you can do the following in Keychain Access:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the Keychain password\n\n*For each really sensitive item you have in there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select a relevant item in Keychain Access\n\n*Get information on the item with the Get Info menu\n\n*Select the Access Control tab\n\n*Mark the Ask for Keychain password checkbox\n\n\n\nThat should allow for the most sensitive passwords (or all of them, if you apply it to all of them) to require your password to be provided every time they are about to be used, and hence won't show in Safari's saved passwords unless that Keychain password is provided.\nAnother option is creating a new keychain, different from the login keychain, with a different passwords, and move the items from the login keychain. The system can find the needed items in that keychain, and you will need to provide that different password instead.\nOf course, another option is using 1password.\n\nA: Change the keychain password, and then lock the keychain when not using the Mac.\nUnless you want everyone to be able to login to your accounts. Then it's just that you need a change in policy, not in keychains.\n", "Q: Unable to change clock separator I am using OS X Yosemite 10.10.3.

A friend and I went to a local Apple Authorized Service Provider the other day to ask if he had any advice about getting a job, and he suggested studying and getting tested for ACMT (Apple Certified Mac Technician) certification. However, since winter WWDC is coming, he suggested not doing it until winter break or something so that I can learn what OS X 10.11 is like and won't get certified on an OS that's immediately going to go out of date, even though the certification is for life. My parents think I could manage it over the summer, so I'm conflicted. Would the ACMT exam still be about Yosemite by the end of the summer, and is there anything else I should know about that could influence my decision?\n\nA: I'll adapt my general advice for people looking to start working or consulting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't pay for certification or education until it makes business sense.\n\n\nBusiness sense means you can incorporate that cost in a quote to one or more paying customers. I would treat any non-budgeted expenditure as something you need to run by your investors formally. If you are the investor in your company, then you owe yourself the same level of service as you would expend if you took money from relatives, friends or even an external investor.\nThe condition above is relaxed a little if you are undergoing formal education and have budgeted for that or taken on loans. Then you'll want to check in with your life coach / student advisor to again make the case for that expenditure of even more limited resources (typically students operate at very low cash burn rates) and time.\n\nSo, in your specific situation - the advice the ASP gave you is good, but in their favor. Of course they want to hire someone that already has invested all the time and money to become certified. Follow up with them and ask for a written job offer outlining the hours they would employ you and the rate they would pay for someone that shows up with a valid cert.\nIf they balk - you'll know that the advice was general and not specific. If they don't have an open position, you probably shouldn't pay for training as specific as ACMT. It's a great exam, extremely hard for someone who hasn't worked 6 months in a computer repair shop as an apprentice.\nAsk first if you could be hired as an apprentice and lower rate and then have a clause for a raise if you can study and pass the exam once you are working. Either way - best of luck and let us know how things go over the summer in the comments or [chat] room.\n", "Q: How can I make a keyboard shortcut for an item with unicode characters? I have used custom keyboard shortcuts for a long time, and as usual the new version of OSX Yosemite changes all the app translations to make them slightly different enough that none of them work. After going through all the shortcuts I discovered that the Spanish entries for next/previous item in Preview don't work. Here is a screenshot of the menu item:\n\nAnd here is a screenshot of the option as set up in the keyboard preferences:\n\nDespite both texts look the same (and therefore I should be able to override the default shortcut) the custom shortcut doesn't get assigned (it did in Mavericks!). My guess is that it stopped working because Yosemite uses a different unicode combination for the first letter. How can I figure out the correct unicode sequence so that the keyboard shortcut is assigned properly?\n\nA: This is a comparison to mavericks (10.9.5) Preview\n\nIt looks like the only change is the back/forward keyboard shortcuts. Or maybe my Spanish is not up to the snuff.\nI am not sure why would you try to make keyboard shortcuts that already exist.\nBut see this info: What do I type to produce the command symbol (⌘) in Mac OS X?\nAnd this info: http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_computing_symbols.html\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Gmail properly via Outlook 2015 for Mac?

I have another email account that I access via Outlook, so it would be good to have everything in one place.\nEvery time I try to set GMail up on Outlook, it doesn't work correctly.

What settings should I use?\n\nA: Interestingly enough, I was just searching for a good mail app, and found that there is a new Gmail desktop app coming out in the next week. I'm going to try it, because I'm not quite satisfied with the other mail apps, and I like google's formatting. To manage multiple email accounts, you may consider having your other emails forwarded to your gmail account. That's what I've been doing. It's a temp fix for what you're looking for, but may help.

I then tried to restore it but all the versions were rtf. I then choose to view the page a plain text and restore again and now all the versions were plain text. Again no javascript or html tags. How can I restore my file as a html file?\n\nA: I had the same problem and found this resource to help me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your HTML document by writing the HTML codes in TextEdit. But when you try to save do not choose Web Page in the file formats drop-down. If you choose this, all of your HTML codes will appear on the page.\n\n*Go to the Format menu and choose “Make Plain Text.”\n\n*Save the file with a .html extension. Then you can edit the file in any other text editor as plain HTML.\n\n\nBut if you need to edit it in TextEdit later, you need to change TextEdit preferences. If you don't change the TextEdit preferences, it will open your HTML file as an RTF file, and you will lose all your HTML codes. To change the preferences\n\n\n*\n\n*open TextEdit and choose “Preferences” from the TextEdit menu.\n\n*Switch to the “Open and Save” tab.\n\n*Make sure the checkbox is checked in front of “Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text.”\n\n*It also helps to have TextEdit default to text files (instead of Rich Text) if you use it to edit HTML a lot. To do this, switch back to the “New Document” tab and change the Format to “plain text.”\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to sync OS X Photos app with Android Phone? I have an Android phone and a MacBook, and what I am trying to figure out is a way to do bi-directional sync between the OS X Yosemite's new Photos app and my device's internal storage. So far, I am using DropSync to do a two-way sync between my device photos and storage in Dropbox, and that works fine. The next step that I thought I could do was use Automator to force sync that particular folder with Photos app, but I cannot seem to find any option in Automator that works with Photos - all I have is iPhoto. Is there any way to achieve this?\nP.S. I even tried the new Google Photos, but that doesn't do two-way sync with my device's internal memory if I delete something from the Photos library.\n\nA: Here is how you can sync from Dropbox (or a directory of your choosing) into Photos, when new photos are added:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator, and create a \"Folder Action\"\n\n\n*On the top where it says \"Folder Action receives files and folders added to\" select \"Choose folder\", then \"Other\", and select your Dropbox folder (or whichever directory contains your photos)\n\n*Add a single Run AppleScript action with the following code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set file_strings to {}\n    repeat with current_file in input\n        set file_as_string to (current_file as string)\n        if words -2 through -1 of (do shell script \"file --mime-type \" & quoted form of (POSIX path of file file_as_string as string)) contains \"image\" then\n            set file_strings to file_strings & {(file_as_string) as alias}\n        end if\n    end repeat\n\n    tell application \"Photos\" to import file_strings\nend run\n\nYour Folder Action should look like this:\n\n\n*Now save it with a name of your choosing, and from now on, photos added to the folder you chose will be imported to Photos.\n\n\nLet me know if anything goes wrong!\n\nA: I have an HTC One S and was using the HTC Sync Manager desktop app. It has the option to import photos to iPhoto after syncing:\n\nUnfortunately with the migration to new Photos app this is no longer useful.\nSo I found William T Froggard's excellent answer above. In the end I was able to use a slightly simpler variation I'll detail below.\nFirstly the useful thing to recognise is that even though I've turned off the iPhoto option, HTC Sync Manager is still copying photos to the mac. They go to /Pictures/HTC_DEVICE_MEDIA and then various cryptically named subfolders under there.\nWe can use some of Apple's ready provided snippets to make the scripting simpler in Automator, hopefully this screenshot will suffice:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Get Folder Contents\" ...this step ensures we look through all the subfolders, not just the files in the top level (there are none).\n\n*\"Filter Finder Items\" ...I want to import the videos as well, this step also filters out any file types that are not importable.\n\n*\"Run AppleScript\" ...since we already have a filtered list of importable files we can just pass input straight to Photos for importing. By including return input at the end we could add another step at the end of the chain if we wanted (no need here, but I guess it's good practice in these kind of scripts).\n\n", "Q: Can't install Windows 8? Okay, so this is the first time ever that I install a non-Mac operating system. But it went like this:\nFirst, I downloaded the drivers to a 4GB USB stick. Then, I created a 300GB partition on my hard drive. I put my SuperDrive with my Windows 8 installation CD into my computer and booted, I went through the installation process and then it said that something was wrong with my hard drive format.\nI then formated it into a NTSF and booted again, upon which it complained about that my hard drive is MBR and that it needs to be GPT, so I just decided I will continue tomorrow and format my drive again through the installation CD.\nSo, today I tried booting my computer today again, but on the first step the installation program just said that it can't find my drivers, so I restarted into OS X and redownloaded the drivers and tried again, same thing. I tried changing my USB and SuperDrive from USB-2 to USB-3 but it didn't work either.\nNow when I boot, it just says:\n\nnon system disk\npress any key to reboot\n\nAnd I have tried to reboot 3 times but I still just get that message. Is it supposed to be this complicated to install Windows? What can I do? I just want to play a game.\n\nA: The Bootcamp app will walk you through creating the install media from your ISO and the proper partitioning. No need to create one manually.\nI would delete that partition you made, expand your Mac volume back into the open space and then recreate the USB stick using BootCamp. It should ask for an ISO of the Windows install media and use the drivers in the App to slipstream the driver files into the installation media. You'll need a 4GB USB stick (minimum, bigger is fine). Creating the install USB stick takes a while (30-40 minutes in some cases) then run bootcamp and follow the prompts.\nIt will give you a GUI for resizing your Mac partition. It will then properly format it and put the necessary Windows boot files on the drive and then boot you into the Windows installer.\nIf you follow those instructions it should all work for you fine, unless there is already a non-standard partition arrangement on the drive.\n", "Q: automating OSX 10.9.2 http://youtu.be/xi5UuemkYd0 is a video that kinda shows what I need to do.\nI have two things i need. The first is software that can control the mouse on osx 10.9.2. What needs to happen is it needs to go up and click aux 1 and go down and click say ProPresenter. Then it would do the same for aux 2 and 3.\nThe second thing i need is a way to make sure any key presses do not interact with the ATEM software. I was thinking about some sort of say 10-15 key external keyboard that did not map to normal keys. Not sure though.\nA bit more info on what I am doing here. This software controls a video switcher board at our church. Auxes 1,2,3 and 4 are respectively front screen, back screen, choir screens and a screen in front of stage.\nAt different time during the service I have to switch between sources. At the moment I am rapidly clicking each aux but when you are switching 4 sources at once it gets a hair too slow. So I want to set up a way to hit a single button to do what i need. I am not sure but I figure I could get away with about 5-10 different scenes set up. \nThe other issue is that the ATEM software also controls the main video switcher as well as the aux screens and I really do not need to hit any keys that make it do anything because we are live on TV at this point and I do not need to be messing up the rest of the team.\n\nA: See if this AppleScript code does what you want. It should click the menu item \"ProPresenter\" of the menus \"Aux1\", \"Aux2\" and \"Aux3\" as you requested:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell menu bar 1 of application process \"ATEM Software Control\"\n    click menu item \"ProPresenter\" of menu \"Aux1\" of menu bar item \"Aux1\"\n    click menu item \"ProPresenter\" of menu \"Aux2\" of menu bar item \"Aux2\"\n    click menu item \"ProPresenter\" of menu \"Aux3\" of menu bar item \"Aux3\"\nend tell\n\nTo set this up as a keyboard shortcut, use the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator\n\n*Create a new Service\n\n\n*Add a single Run AppleScript action to your Service with the following code:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell menu bar 1 of application process \"ATEM Software Control\"\n    click menu item \"ProPresenter\" of menu \"Aux1\" of menu bar item \"Aux1\"\nend tell\n\n\nMake sure it's set to receive \"no input\" and work in \"ATEM Software Control\". Click on \"any application\", then \"other\", and navigate to the app.\n\n*Save it with a name of your choosing.\n\n*Now, go into Keyboard preferences, click on the \"Shortcuts\" tab, then click on \"Services\". Your newly created service should be at the bottom. Click on it, and click on \"add shortcut\" and specify a shortcut to your liking.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Lastly, go into \"Security and Privacy\" settings, click on the \"Privacy\" tab, and then \"Accessibility\". Make sure you see Automator in the list. If not, click on the lock on the bottom left and enter your password, then click on the \"+\" and add Automator to the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Repeat this with modified AppleScript code for each camera you need to switch between, with a different shortcut for each.\n\n"]
