["Q: Preview signature annotation: Without the owner password, you do not have permission to create or modify annotations in the document I need to download a banking form and email it back.\nAfter opening the PDF in macOS Preview, I attempt to sign it via Tools > Annotate > Signature\nThis gives the error:\n\n\nWithout the owner password, you do not have permission to create or modify annotations in the document.\nEnter the password to unlock annotation of the document.\n\nHow can I sign this PDF document?\nAdding an annotation seems like it should be controlled by the client, not the document itself. Can I force Preview to add an annotation?\nCan I somehow create an unlocked read/write copy of the document without this signature protection?\n\nA: Just want to share my findings, since I find this forum is very helpful, and maybe somebody else would benefit from my finding too.\nI encountered the same problem, and I solved it by saving the file by ADDing an owner password, then reopen it. The procedure:\n\n*\n\n*in Menu, click Menu --> File --> Export ... (if you have the option of \"saving file as ... \" you can use it too, you want to get a file saving dialogue with encryption option)\n\n\n*in the opened file saving dialogue, enter file name and directory as you normally do, then click \"Permission\" button,\n\nand in the next dialogue, enter password in \"Owner Password\" field, like shown below, then click \"Apply\"\n\n\n\n*click \"Save\" file in the next screen, if it's not already saved.\n\n\n*Reopen the file saved. Try to sign again, this time when it prompts for password, just type in the password you created / entered before, then it should work.\nIt might look long, but it's not that complicated.\nBTW, I used Preview version 11.0 with MacOS Monterey (12.5)\n\nA: The PDF has been 'secured' with a password by the bank. If you click on Tools > Show Inspector in Preview (Command I) and then click on the padlock tab, you will see something like this:\n\nwhich should tell you how the document has been protected.\nUltimately, if the bank has put a password on to stop people altering the document (i.e. adding their signature), then you need to go back to them and complain.\nOr do it the old-fashioned way: print it out, sign it, and scan it.\nThere are tools that will remove password protection on PDFs, but their legality is questionable (depending on where you live), and it's not wise to return a 'cracked' document to a bank.\n\nA: For a 1 page form\n\n*\n\n*Complete the form except the signature then take a screenshot of it.\n\n*Add your signature to the screenshot.\n\n*Submit it as an image or save the image as a PDF and submit that.\n\nFor a multipage form, if it lets you you can do the above on the signature page and replace the signature page on the form. If you don't have the permissions for that you can do the above with every page.\n\nA: Duplicate the PDF file and start annotating.\nGo to File --> Duplicate.\nor\nShift + Command + S.\n", "Q: Why is a subfolder created when syncing a second Mac's Documents folder via iCloud? I got a MacBook first and synced Documents and Desktop to iCloud. Then I got a Mac Mini and also enabled syncing. Now with the Desktop it works as expected: Same files on both Desktops. But in Documents a subfolder for my \"Mac Mini Documents\" was created. I was expecting a single shared Documents folder. Can I put those files (Mac Mini's Documents) in the main Documents folder without breaking anything?\n\nA: This is how it works. You can now merge and clean up the documents as you wish.

Is it possible? I have MacbookPro14,2, and following is the internal ethernet spec. I was wondering if its possible to use external gigabit ethernet (found on USBc dock), and have gigabit internet. I have a gigabit lan connection. I was wondering since the USB speed is up to 480 Mbps. Or its not at all possible to get gigabit internet speed with macbook pro?\n\n\nA: Your image shows the Apple T1 Controller instead of an ethernet controller. Your model Mac does not have builtin ethernet. Apple recommends a Belkin USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, which is compatible with your 2017 13-inch MacBook Pro. However, you could also use a dock with Gigabit ethernet and an USB-C connection to your Mac.\n", "Q: How can I see all available params in the commands for Finder, Dock etc? I'm trying to build my own settings script with dotfiles, like this one https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles/blob/main/.macos\nHow can I see all the available parameters can be passed into\ndefaults write com.apple.finder ????\nor\ndefaults write com.apple.dock ???\nand/or the rest components so I can create my own script?\n\nA: There's no command that will give you such a list.\nThere's also no published official documentation from Apple with such a list.\nThe defaults command essentially just writes some setting you indicate to a file. You could write anything you could come up with really, and it would still just write it to the file. It performs no checking that what you indicate is a \"real\" setting, nor that the value you specify is valid.\nIt simple writes data to a file - and gives no guarantee that the program you're trying to target will actively read that setting and use it.\nYou'll have to resort to the published documentation by Apple and the various scripts and forum postings you can find online with instructions on available settings you can change with the defaults command.\nIf you want to explore yourself and find \"hidden\" or \"not well known\" settings, then you can try looking inside the binaries of the programs, you mention, in order to discover new settings. If you are a software developer, you'll have tools to reverse engineer binaries that can help you a bit more - but for non-professionals, you'll probably need to resort to simple tools and lots of \"trial and error\". For example you can run a command like this:\nstrings /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder\n\nIt will give you a massive list of text strings found inside the binary - some might be settings, a lot of them won't be. You can use grep to filter the output like this:\nstrings /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder | grep cmdPref\n\nWhich will give you a list of things to try like:\ncmdPrefShowHardDrives:\ncmdPrefShowExternalHardDrives:\ncmdPrefShowRemovableMedia:\ncmdPrefShowMountedServers:\ncmdPrefWarnOnEmptyTrash:\n\nYou'll find that these correspond with settings you can modify with defaults under names such as WarnOnEmptyTrash, ShowExternalHardDrives and so on.\nYou can also look through the list of strings searching for settings you already know, and by chance nearby will be other, for you yet unknown, settings.\n", "Q: How can I edit macOS system localization files? Recently, Apple has decided to force gendered expressions in the German locale. They say there is no way to undo this, so I've been trying to sniff out a way to change the affected strings on my own.\nI've found some translation files inside /usr/share/locale and /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemFolderLocalizations, but they do not contain what I am looking for.\nOne exact thing I am looking for is the label for \"Users & Groups\" in the system settings menu. Anybody have an idea where these strings are stored and if and how they're editable?\nAny help appreciated!\n\nA: They're located in /System/Library/PreferencePanes, within whatever the Users & Groups prefpane is called. If you're on 10.15 or later, you won't be able to edit them without significant effort. This is due to macOS now using a \"signed system volume\" which, by default, mounts the system partition as read-only. If you do manage to mount it as read/write, you'll have to go to additional steps to prevent macOS from checking for modifications.\n\nA: The strings you are looking for are in System/Library/Core Services/SystemFolderLocalzations/de.lprojSystemFolderLocalizations.strings.\nThis is a simple XML file with a dictionary of key-string pairs, like that:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\"\n\"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n<key>Applications\n<string>Programme\n<key>Compositins\n<string>Kompositionen\n<key>Configuration\n<string>Konfiguration\n<key>Deleted Users\n<string>Gelöschte Benutzer:innen\n[snip]\n\nThe offending string is in the last line.\nHowever, this is on a read-only volume, even when you mount it from a different OS instance and have to navigate to it through /Volumes. csrutil disable won't change this, either.\nOrwellian Newspeak is real and forced upon us without having a choice.\n", "Q: Determining if Low Power Mode is Enabled/Disabled from Command Line · macOS 12.2.1 (Monterey) According to this article the following script should return the current Power Mode state:\npmset -g |grep lowpowermode\n\nThis is what it actually returns in my case:\n\nWhen set through system preferences, the script doesn't seem to change in either Low or High Power mode.\nDoesn't change neither if the script is:\npmset -g |grep highpowermode\n\nAm I doing something wrong?\n\nA: First note that while your picture looks correctly-entered, the line appearing in your question has \"highpowermode\" printed which, to my knowledge, is not one of the management settings entries.\nNext, about grep; in the form used in that article, grep just filters down the output piped | to it from the first command, to include only lines containing lowpowermode …and you apparently don't have any. So, grep is just filtering out everything. You can instead read through all the power settings—the complete output of the first command—by just entering:\npmset -g\n\nWe don't have the complete picture yet, but my guess is that your Mac model does not fully support the new lowpowermode, so pmset doesn't include a setting for it.\n", "Q: Can I recover boot camp partition after removing it with gpt remove? My old MacBook Pro, A1286, (15in, mid-2012) has an SSD that divided my main boot disk into two partitions, one for Mac OSX (running 10.13, High Sierra) and one for Boot camp (running Windows 10).\nThe boot partition was always MacOSX.  Unfortunately, after I removed it to try to use it as an external drive, it got damaged in some way after I reinstalled it.  It would not longer boot correctly was identifying as type \"FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF\" when I went into recovery mode and ran diskutil list from the terminal.\nThe bootcamp partition was still bootable though.\nIn my attempts to repair my boot partition I came across this question that seemed to be very similar to what was happening to me.\nI tried to follow the steps laid out by @klanomath.  Two problems arose those:\n\n*\n\n*I still got an error when I tried to verify the disk with diskutil verifyDisk disk0 (Specifically: Error: -69808: Some information was unavailable during an internal lookup Underlying error: 1: POSIX reports: Operation not permitted)\n\n*In trying to rebuild the partitions I removed all of them from disk0, and then tried to add them back.  It seemed to go ok, but now the bootcamp partition is not recognized.\n\nDoes anyone know who to restore a bootcamp partition using gpt or another method without losing the data in the partition?\nThanks\nEDIT:\nHere is a image of the output of diskutil list\n\nEDIT 2:\nProgress - After @David Anderson pointed out an error (thank you for catching that) in the value I entered for the type, my partition for boot camp is recognized as \"Windows Basic Data\" type.\n\nAnd in Startup Disk, it shows as an option\n\nBut unfortunately, when I try using Startup Disk to use it as the boot disk it won't boot still. And says;\n\"No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\"\nWhen I turn on the computer and hold down the option key it doesn't show up as an option either.\n\nHere is the output from  gpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\nAnd here is the output from export LC_CTYPE=\"ASCII\";dd if=/dev/disk0s2 bs=512 count=1 | vis -cw;echo\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter updating the type of the partition to 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC it shows as an option to boot into if I restart the computer.  But it does not show in Startup Disk.  And when I try to boot to disk0s2 it will hang at the apple logo with a full progress bar.\nI believe I have an idea of what may be complicating my situation.  First a little further explanation of how my drives were arranged in the computer originally.\nOriginally I had an HDD in the computer running OSX (10.8 I believe), then after awhile I added a second drive, an SSD (disk0) and partitioned it to have a OSX partition (disk0s2) and a bootcamp partition (disk0s3).  The SSD OSX became my primary boot partition and the old HDD I used for storage, but I never removed OSX completely off of it (now listed as disk1 in diskutil)\nA little ago I needed to be able to use the Bootcamp partition but did not have the power adapter for the mbp, so I tried to remove the SSD and use it as an external on a different computer, that did not work, and after I placed it back into the original mbp is when disk0 s2 wasn't being recognized and I started to try to fix it.  This is when I messed up my bootcamp partition and then I posted on here.\nI believe the OSX Recovery that I have been using is from the original HDD which only had 10.8 on it.  And after doing some research it seems that maybe 10.8 can't identify the newer OSX partition (disk0s2) and that is why in Startup Disk I don't see it, but if I reboot the computer it does show up as an option.\n\nHere are the outputs that you asked for.\nsw_vers\n\nls -l /Volumes/BOOTCAMP/Boot/BCD\n\ndiskutil list\n\n\n\nA: \nNote: You should make all the corrections to the GPT before making the changes given in this answer.\n\nYour disk0 is not hybrid partition, which means the output from the command fdisk /dev/disk0 will probably appear as shown below.\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 60801/255/63 [976773168 sectors]\nOffset: 0   Signature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 255  63 - 1023 255  63 [         1 -  976773167] <Unknown ID>\n 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n\nTo create a hybrid partitioned disk, you need to edit the Master Boot Record (MBR) table on disk0.

My previous smartphone was an Android phone and I used to sync my photos with NextCloud for Android. So I've now installed NextCloud for iOS and marked my folders as available when offline, assuming that is how you download your photos to your iPhone with NextCloud (I've verified in airplane mode that NextCloud can open the photos, so the photos are actually there in the iPhone memory, somewhere).\nAfter it finished downloading, in the Photos app I only see a \"NextCloud\" folder which contains only a text file (a log of what NextCloud downloaded), but no pictures. However, since I can see my photos in the NextCloud app for iOS even when I activate airplane mode, I'm pretty sure they are there, but I suspect that there is non where the Photos app assumes them to be. But I might also be wrong, so please don't take my word on that.\nWhat should I do to have my photos show up in Photos?\n\nA: This is a very common type of question here. The sandbox security model causes this split in one app’s somewhere being different than another apps somewhere by default.\nSandboxing means each app can’t see the downloaded files of another. Even Apple apps honor this restriction. The developer has to take extra steps to expose files to other apps and/or use specific calls to share data and files with photos.app (for example).\nTLDR - contact the developer of the app to see if they can or will implement using files app to store the files outside the app sandbox.\nThere is an SDK / API to share storage with photos. Many apps use that, but I can’t say if the one you chose works that way. One I use and am more familiar with is Pixelmator. It can store photos in its sandbox and also knows about how photos stores files/documents and asks permission to access the storage of the photos sandbox.\n", "Q: What is the difference between \"Remove\" and \"Remove All\" in Safari Preferences › Privacy › Manage Website Data?

I am trying to setup an Apple TV for an elderly person with dementia so she can watch TV.\nI have her Apple credentials, and I set it up so that I get the two-factor authentication codes on my iPhone.\nHowever when I try to add channels/apps to her Apple TV, I get this fun error message:\n\nShe doesn't have other devices such as a phone or a computer (because of her condition, we have to do things for her). And my devices are paired with my personal Apple ID.\nI tried logging in with her info on the Apple website, but haven't found a \"Create iTunes Store Account\" option on there.\nHow can I create an \"iTunes Store Account\" for her so she can be able to watch TV? Can someone who only has an Apple TV use it?\n\nA: If you have a Mac, you can make another account on the computer and use that account to sign in and create the iTunes Store account.\nI recommend creating a regular non-administrator account for this person, and fully signing into iCloud as well, but (it seems like) a Guest account should also work.\nThe disadvantage to a Guest account being that you don't stay signed in if you ever need to adjust the account in the future.\n\nA: This is an unfortunate reality of Apple's walled garden: they expect you to have a core computing device (iPhone, iPad, etc.) already before you get to use one of their devices like an Apple TV.

I've shared folders on the server, enabled SMB sharing in the options and enabled the accounts for Windows sharing. On the client, I connect with smb://user@server. I get an error message saying that access to the account has been denied by the server.\nIn Console on the client I have this:\ndebug   00:57:01.961611+0200    NetAuthSysAgent AuthenticateWithURL: Authentication FAILED, user name <private> domain '<private>' gss client principal <private> - 9 gss server principal <private> - 3  for <private>\ndebug   00:57:01.961658+0200    NetAuthSysAgent SMB_OpenSession: - error = -5999!\n\nAnd on the server:\nerror   00:59:40.065161+0200    smbd    smb2_dispatch_session_setup: session_setup_transact status: 0xc000006e\n\nAny idea what I could try to get access?\n\nA: This Apple Technote provided the solution. The key is to add the SMB users to the SMB service access control list (SACL).\nI had to run these commands for each user that needs to be authenticated via SMB:\nDetermine the user's GUID:\ndscl /Search read /Users/<username> GeneratedUID\n\nAdd the user to the SMB service access control list (SACL):\nsudo dscl /Local/Default append Groups/com.apple.access_smb GroupMembership <username>\nsudo dscl /Local/Default append Groups/com.apple.access_smb GroupMembers <guid>\n\nIf you want to remove the SACL, use the following Terminal command:\nsudo dscl /Local/Default delete /Groups/com.apple.access_smb\n\nIt's beyond me why this manual intervention is actually needed. A clear bug if you ask me. The Sharing settings pane should do this automatically.\n\nA: Had the same issue — other solutions provided here didn't work for me. In my case the share is on an external drive. I noticed a log on the server:\nerror   14:57:41.211700-0700    kernel  System Policy: smbd(23190) deny(1) file-read-data /Volumes/plethora\n\nI had to go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access and add /usr/sbin/smbd to the allowed apps.\n\nA: I want to chime in here, in case this can help someone else!  I tried the solution above from @OrtwinGentz, but it didn't work for me; HOWEVER, it did lead me to a similar solution that did work for me.  My problem manifested a little differently, but I think it had the same underlying cause (whatever that may be).\nMy config:  I have a 2014 Mac Mini server with 2 raid shares that we use on various machines within our company network.  We have Mac clients on several different OS versions, Win clients on several OS versions and a Linux client running Ubuntu 20.04 on the network.  We use the AzureAD that comes with O365 for authentication of the Win machines and also have an Active Directory server in Azure that is synced with the O365 AD and also serves as our DNS master, which is used by the Macs and some other devices. The Linux machine is listed in the AD system and uses the Azure DNS server, but is not joined to the domain for auth purposes - it uses local auth only.\nPrior to the problem, most network machines mounted the drive using the qualified machine name (e.g., <computer>.ad.<domain>.com).  Two exceptions were one win11 machine and the Linux machine, both of which could only mount using the ip addr.\nThe Problem: We upgraded the Mac Mini to Monterey (12.5) and that's when the trouble started. Most machines were able to mount the shares, except for the one Win11 and Linux machines. I tried for 2 days to fix, but couldn't find a solution.  I had run across this SE topic, but the dscl commands failed, so I moved on.  I circled back to it today and decided to look harder at why they didn't work.\nThe Solution: I used the Mac Directory Utility to look into the Local Groups directory and saw that there indeed was NOT a SMB entry with RecordName = com.apple.access_smb, but rather a bunch of (8-9) entries for each shared resource, which had in the RecordName com.apple.sharepoint.group.NN (NN=2-digit number).  On a whim I chose one of these 'raid' groups and substituted its RecordName in the dscl commands from the solution above.\nsudo dscl /Local/Default append Groups/com.apple.sharepoint.group.23 GroupMembership <username>\nsudo dscl /Local/Default append Groups/com.apple.sharepoint.group.23 GroupMembers <guid>\n\nBAM!! The Linux system mounted right up!  Then the Win11 system too!  I also found that I didn't need to add users to every share, both raids mounted fine.  I then added the other users that might use the Linux or Win11 systems and poured myself a cold one... Cheers.\n", "Q: Delete timemachine backups - not by date, but by disk I'm on Big sur\nI have several disks on my mac. Some of this disks have been changed by others or went wrong, etc. Now they are not there any more. But if I go in my time machine drive I see the backups for them. I need to remove them from the disk, but it seems there's no command for it in tmutil. All I can find is the delete command and all the examples I find they are just for deleting a directory. But not the backup itself.\nAnd if I try the risky delete through osx I get an error telling me that the backup can't be deleted.\nI need to remove this drives completly from my time machine drive... as they are taking loads of space.\n\nA: If the normal system is saying there is an error, you likely want to stop this attempt to free space. Something is wrong with the system or the filesystem so you want to figure that out if your backups are at risk.\nIn the past with HFS only systems, the bypass command allowed someone that was sure about which file or folder needed removing to surgically perform the same “delete all versions” of a file that the gui allowed.\nRunning that on one file (rather than a folder) might be useful to see if there are detailed errors that your system didn’t print when you tried this delete.\nIf you need any files that were backed up, it’s safer to get a new drive to start a new backup. Then go over the old drive and decide how much of it you need. Just a few files could be hand copied back to the main system, backed up and then deleted. Simpler is to just label the old drive “backups from 2015 to 2022” and archive it on a shelf. Hopefully it will serve you until you are sure you don’t need any data and then you securely erase and put it back in service or recycle it.\n\nSome unsolicited advice, The benefit of backups is you don’t have to know what was lost to get it back later. I wouldn’t risk that if I could safely spend $100 on a new 4 TB drive (for instance). It’s hard to guess your setup though - we don’t know the value of your data, time and budgets for getting more storage or spending time learning why the delete function failed…\n", "Q: Where is the light sensor on iMac 27' 2020? Where is the ambient light sensor on iMac 27' 2020? I'd like to put a webcam cover without affecting the sensor.\n\nA: 8 mm to left of webcam on my 2019 iMac - I think yours is the same.  Look carefully and you should see a 1 mm grey circle.  But a finger over it and (with auto-brightness enabled) the screen will dim a bit.\nYou should still be able to cover just the webcam.\n", "Q: Using a MacBook Air outsde ☀️ with \"Inverted Screen Colors\" I occasionally sit in the garden, under a parasol, and am in very long and boring Teams meetings.\nI did a web search on how to see the screen better and found a tip\n\nWorking Outside on Your MacBook Pro? Invert Your Screen Colors!\n\nThat was useful, you can really see the screen better.\nWhat does Invert Your Screen Colors do exactly? How does it work? Is it harmful to the eyes? I'm looking for some more background info on this feature. Does it put more strain on the batteries? Are there any other tips for participating in meetings outside in the garden with a Macbook Pro and never-ending Teams calls?\n\nA: What does Invert Your Screen Colors do exactly?\nEach color on your screen is represented by a number. You may have seen colors in web pages represented as FFEE03: this is a hexadecimal (base 16) number, where Red, Green and Blue values are described by each pair of numbers. Black is 0, and White is FFFFFF (in decimal, 16,777,215). By 'flipping' the numbers to their opposite value in the range, the colors take on their 'complementary' hue.\n\nSo, in the image, all the sliders are set to the middle (grey). You can see how moving any of the sliders one side or the other will affect the color.\nHow does it work?\nMaths. Everything in a computer is represented by a number, and its very easy to transform those numbers into something else. That's what makes computers so useful. The computer is just sending the display controller different numbers.\nIs it harmful to the eyes?\nNot necessarily. But brighter images, viewed for longer, will be more tiring.\nDoes it put more strain on the batteries?\nBattery life is unaffected.\n", "Q: Cannot remove startup volume from Spotlight exclude elements in Spotlight Preferences In System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy\nlately my MBP startup Volume is being added to the list of folders and volumes to be excluded from indexing.\nNo matter if I remove it from the list: as I close the Preference Pane and reopen it I find again the statup Volume added to the list.\nOn the terminal sudo mdutil -s / returns Indexing enabled\nHowever Mail.app refuses to make searches as it states that indexing is disabled.\n\nA: Just a reboot fixed the issue.\n", "Q: macOS constantly adds input sources Some time ago I played around with some custom keyboard layouts for Ukrainian and I don't remember in much detail what I did, but as a result I started to experience this weird bug.\nI downloaded a custom layout and installed it.

Perhaps could you search for all files with extension .keylayout like follows:\nsudo find / -iname \"*.keylayout\" 2>/dev/null\n\nYou will find the Korean layout, which you edited with Ukulele.

When trying to send a mail to a new recipient it quite often happens that I mistype it on the tiny iPhone onscreen keyboard or that I unintentionally touch the screen in a different field while typing, so it changes focus and there is a partial e-mail address in the To: field.\nHow can I correct it without retyping the whole address?\nI tried moving the cursor inside it, but the whole address is selected and I can only  remove or replace it completely.\nI also tried holding the finger on the address for a longer time, hoping that a menu appears, but that just selects it completely.\nOn macOS Mail, a little menu button appears next to such an e-mail address which has an entry that allows editing it.\n\nA: The iOS mail app address field doesn’t obey the conventions for an editable/autosuggestable/autocorrectable text entry. It follows the design of macOS mail from back when it was called OS X.\nOnce you move off the typing on 15.3.1 and below it gets converted into an object and is no longer text that is editable.\n\nThe only thing you can do is compose the addresses in another app. Quick notes on iPad is better than on iPhone - but you can get it from control center and leverage data detectors.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/take-notes-iph1ac0b3a2/ios\n\n*https://www.imore.com/how-use-instant-notes-iphone-and-ipad\nOr use the contact app and allow auto complete to reduce taps when adding contacts that are now known.\n\nA: This is a perfectly asked question. I tested this for sometime, I had the same issue.

E.g. like the One Periodic's Hands Off firewall\nDetails:\nI'm looking for an app or combination of apps that can give more control or 'gate-keep' outgoing connection requests and identify the domain being resolved by name (not IP address). Not just tell me that \"xyz app trying to connect to 12.34.56.78\", where I don't have a clue what the IP address or numerical web address is.\nI've been using Hands Off for a while and it does this well. However, currently (as of 2022 May), it seems there is no Hands Off firewall app compatible with MacOS Big Sur.\nShortcomings with current alternative (Lulu):\nWhen looking for alternatives to Hands Off, I found Lulu, which seems like one of the better firewalls out there. So far though, it's not been a complete solution/alternative.\nShortcoming 1)\nWith Lulu, you can either permanently or temporarily block by process or remote-endpoint (first and second screen shots below). This is great but is lacking when compared to Hands Off.\nFor example, I use Thunderbird email client to receive/send emails. I often get emails with tracking pixels from say, LinkedIn or a marketing email. When I open an email with Thunderbird, Hands Off immediately prompts that there's an attempt by Thunderbird to respond to the tracking pixel (which is triggering Thunderbird to make a connection unrelated to imap/smtp etc.). So far, I haven't noticed any prompts like this with Lulu.\nIn Hands Off's dialog prompt window there are four time/occurrence options to block, \"Always, Until Quit, Until Reboot, Once\" (third screen shot). This is very useful. One of the benefits is that I can selectively allow pixels when I want the sender to know I've opened their campaign email. There are also four connection-type options comprised of Domain/Subdomain Resolving and Outgoing Connections. Also Hands Off shows the name of the domain not just an IP address or numerical domain — more details on this below.\nShortcoming 2)\nWhen Lulu prompts for a decision it mostly or almost always shows a numerical web address...I had to google each web address it showed in order to figure out to whom an app was connecting to. With Hands Off, I can easily add the rule \"Allow domain name resolving and outgoing network connections to imap.gmail.com\". I wasn't able to add such a rule with Lulu...maybe I'm doing something wrong?\nIdeas for solutions/workarounds (perhaps the first is the easiest or most realistic):\n\n*\n\n*Use a completely new firewall app (or a combination of apps e.g. firewall + network monitor) that emulates Hands Off's features. Which app/apps has/have those features?...I'm guessing Little Snitch might have these features but wasn't sure, based on what I've seen on their website.\n\n\n*Big Sur-compatible version of Hands Off?...though this seems unlikely as pointed out by @kenston-choi here: Firewall for outgoing connections\n\n\n*Find/create a fork or some sort of add-on for Lulu to enable adding rules by domain — since Lulu is open-source...and modifying the flexibility of rule application via the prompt screen...someone had suggested something similar here https://github.com/objective-see/LuLu/issues/10\nPS. For the Thunderbird email pixel use-case above, I couldn't find a Thunderbird Add-on Extension that can selectively block tracking pixels upon-prompt. I've heard that using webmail instead of a client with a web browser extension could resolve this use-case. This is not an option for me, as I need to monitor/access multiple email accounts, hence use an email client like Thunderbird.\nNb. Please let me know if I can make my question more concise/succinct and or add/remove relevant/irrelevant tags.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I use Little Snitch\nIts screens for controlling outgoing connections from external IPs look like the last two screen shots you have but can have more options.

Please uninstall it according to the developer's instructions and see what happens.\n\nA: In order to determine if it is a hardware or software issue, try backing up your system, wiping the Mac, and reinstalling a fresh copy of MacOS from the internet. Then put ONLY YOUR FILES back onto the computer, and install each application, program, etc from the internet, fresh copies. If it continues to happen, it's a hardware issue - replacing all the software will ensure that the software is not to blame. (If it starts panicking suddenly after a certain program is installed, then that program is to blame.) If it doesn't happen anymore, then it was a software issue. Try the MacBook's built in diagnostics to see if that finds anything - it didn't on mine, but it could on yours. Instructions on diagnostics here.\n\nA: Certain classes of panics can be partially debugged by their stack dump. We always need to review panic reports with symbolicated stacks. In order to get a symbolicated report:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\nMake sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a general error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n\n*Reboot your machine. The next time this panic occurs, your report will have a symbolicated stack dump. Please update your question with the new report. We may then be able to narrow down the possible causes.\n", "Q: How to switch a text to lowercase within Pages Within Pages, how to switch a text selection to lowercase ( or to uppercase )?\nMy actual workaround is:\n\n*\n\n*copy the text within Pages,\n\n*open vi without any file name,\n\n*paste the selected text,\n\n*keep the ~ pressed along the whole text,\n\n*select and copy the modified text within vi,\n\n*paste it back in Pages.\n\nAnd to be honest, I don't find it either efficient or nice.\n\nA: *\n\n*Select the text,\n\n*Edit (in Pages Menus),\n\n*Transformations,\n\n*Make Lower Case.\n\nHere is an article about this (with screenshots).

I'm trying to build a copy of sqlite3 from source on my M1 Mac Mini running macOS Monterey 12.4 (21F79). The reason I want to do this (instead of using a precompiled build or installing via Homebrew or MacPorts) is that I need to enable the SQLITE_ENABLE_UPDATE_DELETE_LIMIT flag (see here).\nI have read the project's page entitled \"How To Compile SQLite\" but I failed to wrap my head around the process. I vaguely understand that I will need some combination of gcc, Tcl, the Lemon parser, a bit of luck, and the right incantations to feed them all.\nWith regard to that flag, the page specifically states:\n\nIf this option is defined, then it must also be defined when using the Lemon parser generator tool to generate a parse.c file. Because of this, this option may only be used when the library is built from source, not from the amalgamation or from the collection of pre-packaged C files provided for non-Unix like platforms on the website.\n\nI understand this may be an XY problem! Still, I would like to know how to do this—if only to satisfy my curiosity. Does anyone know the steps?\n\nA: You'll need to download the non-amalgated source code version of SQLite. It's available here:\nhttps://www.sqlite.org/download.html\nAt the end you'll see \"Alternative Source Code Formats\", and you'll need the complete source codes.\nNext you'll want to decompress the source codes and then edit the Makefile to include your SQLITE_ENABLE_UPDATE_DELETE_LIMIT option.\nAfterwards you can compile sqlite3.c with this command:\nmake sqlite3.c\n\nNote that if you haven't got compilers installed, you'll want to install the Xcode Command Line Tools first.\nAfter the command above has been run, you'll have an amalgated source code version of sqlite. This again needs to be compiled into the actual binary, you expect. You can do that with a command like this:\ngcc shell.c sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl -lm -o sqlite3\n\nYou can find more detailed instructions on sqlite's web site here:\nhttps://www.sqlite.org/howtocompile.html\n", "Q: Scripting with multiple sections but different result trying to set up a script where a user can select multiple answers.\nso prompt asks for example favorite colors and they choose from list \"black, white, red, orange, blue\".\nthe user selects white and blue, white equals 101 and blue equals 208\nso the result would be 101 instead of white and 208 instead of blue\n\nA: You want a select statement.\nRefer to https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/select-loop.htm for how to construct one.

I have the M1 mac mini with a 256GB ssd.  It is not a fresh disk---I now have only about 30GB remaining.\nI am not interested in synthetic raw disk performance, but in performance on the APFS file system.  so I tried writing bytes to a 4.8G file.  (commas added by me):\n% time dd if=/dev/zero of=1 count=10000000  \n10000000+0 records in\n10000000+0 records out\n5120000000 bytes transferred in 20.313020 secs (252,055,086 bytes/sec)\n\nAt 252MB/s, this is not exactly endearing.  Is this the number I should be expecting?  (I know that there is overhead; I believe on an SSD, file fragmentation is no longer the issue it once used to be, however.)\nread speed seems reasonable at 770 MB/sec:\n% time dd if=1 > /dev/null    \n10000000+0 records in\n10000000+0 records out\n5120000000 bytes transferred in 6.669058 secs (767,724,617 bytes/sec)\ndd if=1 > /dev/null  2.03s user 4.40s system 96% cpu 6.677 total\n\nPS: I compared this to performance on an external USB3 sandisk SSD 2TB, where I get about twice the write performance and about half the read performance.  I also checked whether /dev/zero has special tricks (through comparison with /dev/random), but the modest deterioration on all drives suggests that my dd really does write zeros to ssd.\n\nper darkdust's answer below, here are versions with 4096 block size:\n\n*\n\n*mac mini 256gb internal relatively full: write 1.5GB/s, read 0.75GB/s.\n\n*external usb3 sandisk 2tb relatively empty: 0.4GB/s, read 0.4GB/s.\n\n*And, for kicks, a Samsung Extreme Thunderbolt: 0.5GB/s write, 0.4GB/s read.\n\n\nA: dd is a very bad tool to measure disk performance. It's using a block size of 512 bytes by default, which on an SSD is far from optimal.\nOn the shell, you can determine your SSD's block size via diskutil info /, e.g.:\n$ diskutil info / | grep Block\n   Device Block Size:         4096 Bytes\n   Allocation Block Size:     4096 Bytes\n\nSo let's compare the default 512 byte blocks vs. 4096 blocks (mind the count to get the same number of bytes):\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test count=800000\n800000+0 records in\n800000+0 records out\n409600000 bytes transferred in 2.173086 secs (188,487,708 bytes/sec)\n\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test count=100000 bs=4096\n100000+0 records in\n100000+0 records out\n409600000 bytes transferred in 0.323270 secs (1,267,052,309 bytes/sec)\n\nThat's quite the difference! How about reading and writing in one go?\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test count=1 bs=409600000\n1+0 records in\n1+0 records out\n409600000 bytes transferred in 0.118812 secs (3,447,463,219 bytes/sec)\n\nEven better!\nConclusion: do not use dd to measure disk performance.\n\nA: Your write test was done at 252MB/s, not KB/s. Still, this is extremely low for an M1 SSD. (As well as the read speeds).\nTo speed up writes to an SSD, one must regularly send TRIM commands to the SSD, which informs the disk about which blocks are no longer being used. On macOS, there is no manual trigger, however rebooting will work (or at least it did so back when verbose booting was an option).\nStill, I wouldn't expect that much performance degradation (unless Apple was using even worse SSDs than previously thought). The issue is most likely that you are copying 512 bytes at a time from /dev/null, then writing that single 512 byte block to the disk. Try using the bs= argument with dd, somewhere around 32M or 64M should deliver appropriate results on an SSD.\n", "Q: How do I get back the input source flags on my menu bar? I just upgraded to macOS Monterey 12.4 and now the flags, primarily the one for the current input source, is gone from the menu bar and was replaced with a country code.\nI find the colored flags much easier to work with, also when quickly switching between inputs via a shortcut. How do I get back the flags?\nIs:\n\nwas / want:\n\n\nA: I'm the developer of YouType. It shows the current indicator in the status bar as flags. I'm happy to suggest you try it.\n\n\nA: One way to do this is to make a custom keyboard layout with Ukelele.  It lets you add any icon you want to a keyboard, but also includes in the Resources folder in its download some .bundle files which have a number of the former layouts with their flags.\nTo install those layouts, put the .bundle file in Home/Library/Keyboard Layouts.  To get to Home/Library, do Finder > Go while holding down the Option key.\nIf you need the Ukrainian layout with flag, try this.\nOther apps devoted to solving this problem include Keyboard Switcheroo and Colorful Input Menu Flags.\nI have not seen any official Apple notice regarding this change, which occurred May 16, 2022.  Of the more than 100 keyboards in MacOS, already more than half used the country/language code type format instead of a country flag.  It's possible that recent requests to decouple Russian script input from that country's flag led Apple to decide to move totally to this format.\nThis change may be a direct result of a companywide effort not to denote languages using country flags on Apple’s part.\n\nA: I encourage you not to use bad practices. Flags are not languages. It might work in your specific case, but in general, it does not.\nExamples:\n\n*\n\n*English is spoken in many countries. Which flag should one use: England, UK, USA, Canada, Australia, or else?\n\n*You may want to use a flag of Spain for the Spanish language, but most Spanish speakers live in Mexico.\n\nUsing flags as language indicators is discouraged by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is considered to be a bad practice. More details on the suggestion not to use flags as language indicators can be found at World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Working Group Note 03 June 2014.\nThere is even a web-site dedicated to this problem www.flagsarenotlanguages.com.\n", "Q: How to use Disk Utility on external harddrive - Photos Library is stuck at updating I'm having this problem: (Apple Photo's Library from Mojave to Monterey looks stuck on updating).\nI came across this (Photos: \"Updating Library...\" is stuck, library seems bricked) and it exactly sounds like my problem. The only thing is: I don't know how to use Disk Utility.\nThe external harddrive I use, is used in a network. I use it to store Apple as well as Windows files. From every device I can access this drive (by login). Can I use Disk Utility to repair my Photos Library-file on my external harddrive?\n\nA: If I am understanding you correctly you  have a drive that you think has a problem and it is only attached via network?\nIf so then no you can't use disk utility to repair a network device. Disk utility (and for that matter any disk repair utility) is strictly for drives plugged directly into a computer of some sort.\nIf this drive is plugged into a server of some sort you would need to run any disk repair utilities on the server.\nIf this disk is on a NAS then the NAS itself will have disk repair functions of some sort.\nYou may also be able to unplug the drive from the server/NAS and plug it into your Mac and (assuming it is a Mac-native filesystem) repair it there.\n", "Q: Deleting a friend’s ECG related data I let my friend borrow my watch to try out the ECG feature. However, now I want to delete all data collected while my friend was wearing the watch so it doesn’t appear in my health data. What items does it record and where do I delete them?\n\nA: It’s ideal if your friend only wears the watch for a short time during the ECG scan so that other background data isn’t collected.\n\n*\n\n*Go to Health App\n\n*Show all Health data\n\n*Electrocardiograms (ECG)\n\n*Find the one that your friend took and note the time.\n\n*Choose “Delete Recording” on the ECG\n\n*Now go back to all data and find “Heart rate”\n\n*Select “Show all data”\n\n*Find the readings that took place around the same time as the ECG.\n\n*Swipe to delete all 30+ of them.\n\nAs far as I know, it only takes your heart rate and ECG readings while doing an ECG so deleting those records should suffice. However, it doesn’t hurt to look at all data and see if it happened to capture anything in the background around that same time. This is easier to find if you delete the data immediately after capturing the ECG since All Data sorts by the last time it collected data, making it obvious if something like Blood Oxygen happened to be taken in the background while your friend was wearing the watch.\n", "Q: Universal Control Stopped Working (12.4) I upgraded to 12.4, I had been using Universal Control between two MacBook Pros (Intel ones that are still new enough to support Universal Control) and it had been working great. But after upgrading to 12.4 Universal Control is not working any more.\nI read a bit about how to try to fix this in other forums. It seems like the thing to do is to turn it off (uncheck the 3 boxes in the Display Preferences) restart the computer(s) and then turn Universal Control back on again.\nThat changed the checkboxes but didn’t allow the mouse pointer to cross systems.\nThere's also another strange symptom. On one of the laptops the third check box (the one about automatically reconnecting) won't check. I can't click on it at all. It does not look \"disabled\" (greyed out) but it won't check. I suspect that laptop is the one with the \"issue\" and the other one is probably working fine (it takes 2 to tango though).\nOne more odd thing. Both Macs have external monitors hooked up. On the Mac that was acting strange I unplugged it from it's Thunderbolt hub (how it is connected to the monitors) and now I could check the third box. Universal Control still didn't work though.\nOh yeah, for what it's worth I tried turning Universal Control off on both Macs (and restarting both of them) too.\nI say that because most of the stuff you read about \"Universal Control\" is about connecting a Mac to an iPad. But clearly it's supposed to support 2 Macs.\n\nSince this is a new feature on a new release are people finding a need to take cleanup steps or have solved this yet?\n\nA: I would go straight to Apple Support and not try to list all the things. Start with fresh perspective and let the, direct what to do and in what order.\nThe release notes did say that you have to make sure you are not sharing internet on any device for now. iPadOS 15.4 And macOS 12.4 changed things so you may have to start from scratch if your previous setup didn’t transfer flawlessly.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212757\nIn my case, we had to sign out of iCloud on all devices.

My pain was likely caused by running beta versions for several years on my account.\nThen signing in, whether they did cleanup instantly while I was on with support or the system does some rekey in the background when the last “connected” device signs out so that the next joins are productive, I don’t know.\nI hope someone has a less “nuke and pave” option, but I’m able to control now and so happy all my iOS and macOS devices are now running non-beta versions (for a couple weeks I think).\n\nA: I upgraded MacOS from 13.3 to 12.4 and lost the Universal Control capacity to use the Mac mouse and keyboard on the iPad Pro, it was previously working. I tried signing out of my apple id on both devices, then signing back in, and although that did not initially work, it does now. iPadOS is 15.5 (the latest).\nBefore, when I was in Preferences / Displays, when I tapped the \"Add Displays\" dropdown, there were two options, the second which added just mouse nd extended keyboard functionality; then after the upgrade, there was just the option to mirror or extend, now quite suddenly and without explanation, the second option has reappeared.\n\nA: After spending 4 hours on the phone with Apple with 4 separate call backs, I finally got it working!\nInitially, it would not work no matter what. We went through multiple cycles of turning universal control off on all devices, then restarting them, then enabling the feature. Many cycles of turning off the display preferences and back on, on the Mac, nothing helped.\nShe then suggested I turn off screen time on all devices, and it worked immediately! - but only briefly. It worked with the iPad Air4, but immediately disappeared when I woke up the iPad mini 6 (I have 2 iPads and a MacBook Pro 13\" M1).\nThe next step was to try in safe mode, this did not help. Next step was to create a new admin user account on the MacBook, rebooting and logging into this new account, this worked with both iPads! - I was able to use universal control for the first time in months! - but when I tried to log back into my original account, this broke it again, I was never again able to get it to work, not even deleting the user and re-creating it, argh!\nFinally the support person said you're going to have to re-install the OS. While a pain in the ass and time consuming, thankfully the iCloud backup makes it reasonably safe, without losing any data. After doing a full re-install of MacOS, everything is working as expected (for now!) - I did not need to do anything on the iPads.\n\nA: I just upgraded to macOS 12.5 and Universal Control is working again! I think the issue was a bug in 12.4 that was preventing Universal Control from working if there were 3 (more than 2) monitors on one of the computers.\n", "Q: The malicious software warning when running an app - whitelist multiple files simultaneously? I'm on macOS Monterey and am running an application which depends on binaries for Postgres.  So when I first start up the program, I get the \"can't be opened b/c Apple cannot check it for malicious software...\" for the binary file \"pg_ctl\".  So I go into Security & Privacy settings and click the Allow Anyway button and all good, we're past that one.\nThe problem is there are over 50 dependency files that throw this warning.  So I have to go through the process of allowing the file, kill the app process, start the app again to get the next file that needs to be allowed, for each individual file.  This last install I did took 30 mins to get through it all.  I now have to go install this on several other Macs.\nSo my question is whether there is way to \"whitelist\" all these files at once?  Perhaps add all their paths to some plist somewhere? Or maybe use the xattr command shown in the accepted answer of this thread: \"Install Spotify\" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software  but do so to several files at once?\n\nA: In terminal, type xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/directory/containing/the/binaries/*. The -r flag tells the command to recurse through the directory, removing the flag on all files.\n", "Q: Cannot move (malware) message to junk or trash - Mac Mail Got a malware attachment in an email I knew better than to open. My Sophos auto-protection caught it, too, and named it \"DocExp-AC\".\nHowever, if I tried to right-click to move it to Junk (in preparation to Erase Junk), it appeared to be moved, but then I got a Mac Mail error message that it could not be moved [repeat step several times]. This caused it to actually appear in both Inbox and Junk.\nSame behavior when tying it move it directly to Trash.\nSomehow the bad actors have figured out a way to prevent us from easily deleting the email.\nI've learned to quick-as-I-can stop TimeMachine from auto-backup as once a bad actor gets backed up its a major PITA to delete.\n\nA: As it was a IMAP account I opened the account via the web interface. I was able to delete it completely from the server. When my Mac subsequently fetched new mail it recognized it as having been moved to Trash at the server and moved the local copy to Trash. I was then able to delete it from my Mac Mail Trash (though I had to right-click it twice.) A Sophos Fast System Scan reports no threats found. Whew!\n", "Q: Find my iPhone keeps tracking me?

An app with a small window works for this.\n\n*For a window which overlaps the dock, the snapping is only a gentle snap, you can push the windows further down very easily. It will, of course, be partially hidden by the dock.\n\n*Make the dock smaller - as small as you can still recognise the icons. Optionally, turn on magnification. For me the choice is between a) mid to large icons with autohide, or b) small icons without autohide but with magnification. For years I used mid-size icons with autohide - I can understand that you don't like autohide, so use small or tiny icons with magnification.\n\n*Try putting the dock on the side of the screen. I now do this - smallish icons, magnification, and no autohide.\n\n\nA: You can resize windows to extend below the Dock.\nBut no, the content of application windows will not flow around the Dock …\n", "Q: Use Apple APIs and Kits on a remote server I'm trying to make a cross-platform desktop app for MacOS and Windows that needs to do music recognition, so I'd like to use ShazamKit by Apple. By the way, ShazamKit is only available on Apple platform.\nSo in order to allow Windows users to use it I'd like to build a REST API on some remote MacOS servers, send audio to them and get a response from them.\nDo you think that this could be possible or I'm violating Apple licensing aggreements?\n\nA: I am not a lawyer / your lawyer, but this seems cut and dry against section 2.6 of the developer agreement which covers prohibited uses:\n\nYou agree not to install, use or run the Apple SDKs on any non-Apple-branded computers.\n\nThe preamble also makes it very clear, the license is not going to cover non-Apple hardware.\n\nYou would like to use the Apple Software (as defined below) to develop one or more Applications (as defined below) for Apple-branded products.\n\nIf you were already a developer, you could ask how much a custom license would cost for you to be permitted to do this and build that cost into your financial model, but I would expect a no unless you had a very compelling reason for Apple to host your windows-based API calls.\nYour “I’ll run it on Mac server” runs afoul of this clause, also from the very top of section 2.6\n\nYou agree not to rent, lease, lend, upload to or host on any website or server, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Apple Software, Apple Certificates, or any Services, in whole or in part, or to enable others to do so.\n\nBasically, you’re not really developing for Apple if the data ends up on Windows through a macOS redistribution or hosting arrangement.\n", "Q: Time machine won't recognize Lenovo laptop plugged in via USB to USB-C cable I have a Lenovo laptop, running Ubunutu 14.04 LTS, and I want to connect its hard drive to my MacBook Air running MacOS Catalina 10.15.6.

But when running diskutil list on my Mac, no external disk is listed.\nI'm trying to use the hard drive on the Lenovo laptop to store backups of my Mac. What should I do?\n\nA: I don’t recommend network backup destinations for Time Machine - the tech is highly geared and better for direct attached storage that lets macOS format and manage everything.\nThat being said, you’ll want to connect gigabit Ethernet or Thunderbolt Ethernet and set up smb sharing.

The functionality of the scripts is finished, and there will be no changes, this is just to make it easier to distribute the, err, \"app\".\n\nA: While not a direct answer, you can bypass this by having the functions fallback to env vars when no input is passed\nfunction llg() {\n  the_path=$1\n  [ ! -x $1 ] || ref_branch=\"$path_from_env\"\n  [ ! -x $path_from_env ] || the_path='.'\n  ll \"$the_path\" | grep \"[0-9][0-9]\\(\\.[0-9]\\)\\?M \"\n}\n\nthat way, you can export path_from_env=something before the function is called.\noverall as your complexity increases, you should consider writing the script in ruby or python, rather than writing a bash script.

I have a script that I wrote that uses HandBrakeCLI to convert files from .MOV to .MP4, but then also attempts to preserve various EXIF metadata by using exiftool by using the -TagsFromFile operation to copy tags from the older MOV to the newer MP4 (and then a subsequent additional run for -FileModifyDate<CreateDate).\nWhile everything seems to work and the EXIF tags appear in the output MP4, when I import the MP4 into Photos I don't see any information about location, or the iPhone model that I captured the video with.\nIf I use exiftool to view the metadata of the original MOV and resulting MP4 I do see that the MOV only has 5 GPS-related items (Coordinates, Altitude, Alt. Ref, Latitude, Longitude, Position) while the MP4 has the same but multiple copies of all except 'Position'. Additionally, I can see that the MOV has 'Model' for iPhone, but the MP4 has 'Model' and 'Camera Model Name' both referencing the iPhone.\nDespite this plethora of data, Photos.app says it doesn't know what camera took the video nor does it know what GPS location the video was taken.\nDoes anyone have any insight on this? Is it because it is an MP4 and not a MOV? I'm assuming that Photos.app is getting camera/GPS from the EXIF data in the first place, so why doesn't it recognize it from the MP4?\n\nA: Doing some research and asking on other forums, I found that Photos.app does not discriminate against MP4 versus MOV, but rather that Apple products are very picky about reading the data and don't always follow the Quicktime standards (which they created). To add to the problem, there are tags with the same name in different Quicktime group 2 families (ItemList, Keys, and UserData).\nIn my question, I noted that I was using exiftool -TagsFromFile source.mov target.mp4. Apparently the tool will copy most/all of the tags, but will put them in places that it prefers. The way to work around this is to add -All:All between the source and target filenames as this forces the tool to copy all tags and put them in the same place in the target (not its preferred location).\nSo to complete what I was doing, you would use a command like:\nexiftool -TagsFromFile source.mov -All:All target.mp4\n(Primary information sources here, here, and here.)\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 14\" M1 logs in with Touch ID but not with password For some reason I can't login to my Mac with a typed password, only with Touch ID.\nI have checked if I was entering correctly, if caps lock was activated and have also changed the password, but I simply can't log in with any typed password.\nThe reason I know why I'm not typing it incorrectly is that after logging in with touch ID I go to \"Settings\" and unlock it using the same password with success.

I cannot seem to find any specific articles that seem reasonable. The problem is with using an external monitor with the MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019). A few months ago I switched from an old Apple display to a newer (but not super new) LG 4k monitor -- the one they sold in the Apple store several years ago. I had zero issues with kernel_task before, and starting having the issue with the new monitor. I was in-between housing for a few months before starting to use the new monitor and working only with the laptop with no external monitor and did not have the issue. Unplugging the monitor now also resolves the issue.\nFindings:\n\n*\n\n*Temperatures do not necessarily reach high levels when the issue is occurring. Running Macs Fan Control, I see that the temps rarely go above 70C -- in fact they hover around the same temp generally speaking as when not having the issue. I have seen the temperature go high on occasion, but this was also connected with the separate ManagedClient process (which also runs away on occasion for no apparent reason). There isn't really much a reason for kernel_task to start throttling, unless the temperature sensors are not working properly or something.\n\n*Zoom app is the deathstrike. Running Zoom with video on will cause the issue very quickly. A Zoom session with outgoing video and one or more incoming videos is a killer. Turning off outbound video and asking participants to turn off theirs helps.\n\n*Similarly, running video apps in the browser seem to cause the issue as well.\n\nRed herrings:\nThere is an enormous body of proposed/supposed fixes for this issue. Here are ones that did not work for me.\n\n*\n\n*Reset SMC or NVRAM. On the surface this seems to work. Yay! Unfortunately, when having the issue, often times restarting the machine seems to help. Resetting SMC or NVRAM involves restarting the machine one or more times.\n\n*Connecting the charging of the Mac to the right side. There are many references to plugging in the computer on the right side instead of the left. If this is to alleviate high temperature issues, this would sort of make sense based on the argument that this is causing severe overheating. IMO this is kind of a separate Mac issue. If it works for you, that is great. It isn't my issue. It also kind of sucks from a desk setup perspective if it means that you end up having to put your monitor on the other side of the computer. Mine is connected always on the right side so this did not help me.\n\n*Cleaning out dust and applying thermal paste. This could be a resolution also to high temperature issues. If you are inclined to crack your machine open to do this, have at it. I am sure there is some dust in my machine, but as I mentioned above, this is not so much a temperature issue that I can tell. Also, if you need to apply more thermal paste after less than 2 years of use, there are other issues to discuss.\n\n*Running hardware check in recovery mode. Did this. Machine is reported to be perfectly healthy.\n\n*Running Macs Fan Control. Again, your mileage may vary. For me, it does help a little bit, but does not prevent the issue from occurring. It is sort of like urinating on a bonfire -- it does do something, but ultimately isn't powerful enough a solution.\n\nSemi-practical solutions:\nLet's get back to the 2 things that seem to be \"factual\"(?). The external monitor seems to be the culprit, insofar as things that the user can do to cause the issue to occur, and things that drive the monitor harder also seem to aggravate the issue. How can we address these?\n\n*\n\n*Zoom settings for emergency fixes (patch, not solution). See https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4409500570381-Stopping-all-incoming-video-in-a-meeting-or-webinar. This allows you to turn off incoming video should you need to in a pinch. This coupled with turning off your own outbound video can help quite a bit.\n\n*I have also seen references to turning off hardware acceleration on chrome and other browsers for video playback. I'm not really sure if this does anything to be honest, but I can't say for sure that it does nothing. It is, however, video display and hardware related, so it sounds maybe reasonable(?).\n\n*Changing the resolution used on the external display. I can say for certain that this has worked, at least to the point of making my machine usable. In order to do this, you must go to System Preferences, Displays. Click Display Settings, and while holding down Option, click \"Scaled\" under Resolution. Then click the \"Show all resolutions\" checkbox. Find the current resolution your monitor is set to, and choose the same one that says \"(low resolution)\" to the right of the dimensions. First of all, this sucks, admittedly. It makes your monitor slightly blurry by comparison to what you were running it at. The upside I've found, however, is that I can even join Zoom sessions with multiple people on video without my computer coming to a complete crawl. Since changing this setting I have had the kernel_task issue maybe once or twice in 2 or 3 days and it subsides fairly quickly on its own. Before I was having the issue at least once an hour and had to restart my computer many times a day.\n\nSo, my question is -- has anyone recently found a better solution than Semi-practical solution #3 (i.e. in 2022)? I am in the middle of a project at work, and my work somehow determined that the motherboard needs to be replaced, which is impossible for me to accommodate due to time constraints at the moment. Has anyone received any word from Apple indicating that this is a known software or hardware issue that they have a fix in the works for? In all the discussions.apple.com posts I have seen, the Apple rep restates the OP's issue as if it is a completely unknown issue.\n\nA: Adding my own experience as a record. I recently started using my 2019 MBP16' (10.15.7 Catalina, 8-core i9, 2.4GHz, 32GB ram, 5500M 8GB GPU) with a (rather old) external monitor at 1080p resolution (not that demanding – at least I thought). As soon as I plugged in the monitor, kernel_task would fire up and slow down the CPU to 800 MHz. Tried everything in the post (NVRAM reset, switching side for the supply, pluggling the supply directly in the usb-C hub I'm using), nothing worked.\nAfter noticing that whenever this occurred the 5500M GPU showed no sign of activity, I tried forcing the usage of the Radeon GPU at all times by disabling the automatic graphic switching (System Preferences > Battery or Energy Saver). kernel_task disappeared in a matter of seconds, all temperatures dropped, fans silent and CPU speed back to normal. Evidently there was some issue in the automatic switching which actually didn't switch at all – remaining stuck in trying to use the internal Intel UHD630 which clearly barely handles the MBP monitor itself. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Just to recap from above and call out a potential solution for some:\nChanging the resolution used on the external display does seem to work, at least to the point of making my machine usable. To do this, you can:\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Systems Preferences and select \"Displays\"\n\n*Click \"Display Settings\" (at least in Monterey).\n\n*While holding down the Option key, click \"Scaled\" under Resolution.\n\n*Click the \"Show all resolutions\" checkbox.\n\n*Find the current resolution to which your monitor is set, and choose the same resolution from the list that has \"(low resolution)\" in the name.\n\nThis will make your monitor seem slightly blurry by comparison to what you were running it at. The upside I've found, however, is that I can even join Zoom sessions with multiple people on video without my computer coming to a complete crawl. Since changing this setting I have had the kernel_task issue maybe once or twice in 2 or 3 days and it subsides fairly quickly on its own. Before I was having the issue at least once an hour and had to restart my computer many times a day.\nFor a further emergency fix, in case you don't want to do the above, or if you end up still having an issue running Zoom sessions, see https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4409500570381-Stopping-all-incoming-video-in-a-meeting-or-webinar. This allows you to turn off incoming video should you need to in a pinch. This coupled with turning off your own outbound video can also help quite a bit.\n\nA: In my case it helped to open the MBP(2018,15-inch) and clean the fans. I have 2 LG 5k displays connected and as soon as a Zoom or Microsoft Teams conference started, the temperature was rising although fans were running on max. This resulted finally in the kernel_task hogging > 500%. Buy a pentalobe P5 screwdriver and follow these instructions https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+clean+your+MacBooks+fan+and+prevent+overheating!/144643\n\nA: kernel_task showing high CPU utilisation is not an indication that there is something wrong with kernel_task itself, doing something 'hidden' or otherwise unspecified. It is a regulation mechanism used in order to mitigate high temperatures by making the CPU less available to some other task that may be in some runaway condition, or under high load conditions. See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207359\nThe trick is then to identify what else is going on in your system that is causing the high load. While this answer can't help you with that, I hope to clear up any misunderstanding about what kernel_task is doing. Be sure to check on the Energy Consumption tab in Activity Monitor also. You'll be more likely to see the culprit there.\n", "Q: How to \"pull down the screen to reveal the search bar\" in iPhone Messages I am trying to do a search through my messages according to  How to Search Messages on iPhone & iPad (2022 Update)\nIt says to \"pull down on the screen\":\n\nHowever when I do that on my iPhone6s it simply scrolls.

My music library has music from a large number of sources, which means that the volume of one song can be very different from that of another, and I'm trying to figure out a good way to make it so that all the songs output at the same volume, since it's very irritating having to constantly adjust the volume every time a song changes.\nI've tried doing it by ear with the volume adjust option in each song, but this really isn't precise enough. I've also tried using the Sound Check option in Playback settings, but there's a very irritating bug which means that if you pause the music, then play it again, the Sound Check takes a few seconds to adjust the song to the correct volume, so if it's too loud then you get blasted by music for a few seconds before it returns to normal. I have attempted to fix this by making sure my system is up-to-date, and starting Music in Safe Mode (by holding Option-Command when launching), but to no avail.\nThe only other option I've thought of is using FFmpeg to go through all the songs in my music library and normalise them to a consistent LUFS range. However, I haven't been able to find very clear instructions on the internet about how to do this, and it's also a destructive action, which makes it not ideal. Does anyone have any other suggestions?\n\nA: LUFS is really the only way to do it.

I eventually discovered Myriad which unfortunately isn't available for purchase right now, having recently gone through a change of ownership. I managed to find a friend who let me use his machine for an afternoon to do this. The download does have a trial period, but I haven't checked to see what limitations are imposed - hopefully you could get a complete library conversion from the trial, even if you have to sub-divide your source.\nFor want of a better set of values, I went with the commonly-accepted -14dBFS & I have to say, I've never been happier.\nMyriad can be set to save out in a new folder an exact match of the input hierarchy without touching the originals. One great advantage of Myriad for this is that it keeps each file-type as it re-converts.\nThen it was just a case of swapping folders after conversion, leaving iTunes absolutely non the wiser that anything had changed. Then for my iPhone, I did a sync with no tunes, followed by another with the entire library re-added [simply uncheck the sync box, then re-check for the second pass]… et voilà!\nOnce you do this, remember to switch off Sound Check, or you get playback values that are no longer relevant to the new tracks.\n\nA: Apple have seemingly fixed the bug with the Sound Check feature in Apple Music, so this is what I will use going forward.\n", "Q: How to remove personal information from iMac Pro with MDM (after attempting remote erase) When I was working for a university they bought me a 2017 iMac Pro to use for work from home, which came with some sort of MDM profile linked to the university. When I left several years later, my boss said I could keep the Mac since it was getting old, any new hires would get a new machine anyway.\nI used it for a while without changing anything, but the MDM part of the OS was still linked. I understood that it was possible to remove the machine from the network from Apple Business Manager, and this would allow it to be reset, so I asked my old boss.

How? How can I make a services shortcut (available via right-click menu) that gets the selected text and reads it aloud? There is a \"Speak Text\" step, but I can't figure out how to send the selected text to it (ideally without copying the text to the clipboard).\n\nHere's why: Outlook does not support the Mac's built-in text-to-speech functionality when composing or replying to an email. Elsewhere on the Mac, I use text-to-speech all the time when writing. Having my writing read back to me makes it easier to spot typos and recognize grammar problems.\n\nA: Figured it out.

If I start jEdit by clicking on \"jEdit.app\" in the Applications-Folder, jEdit starts but most folders can not be read. I cannot modify anything.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: My preferred Editor is jEdit which is implemented in Java. On my Mac mini, initially almost everything went more or less well. The problem arose, after having installed an actual Java Engine on Saturday.\nInitially the JVM could not be found. Consequently jEdit could not be launched. After having fixed that problem, jEdit could only read file from the \"Development\"-Directory, when started via Launchpad. The behaviour is completely different, wenn jEdit is started via commandline by the mentioned Alias.\nTo get jEdit working properly again, it is necessary to perform some several funny steps, which are not documented and not really understandable.\nStep 1\ncd /Application/jEdit.app/Contents/PlugIns\nln -s <directory_to-jdk> jdk\ncd ..\n\nEdit Info.plist and add the following lines somewhere in the file\n<key>JVMRuntime</key>\n<string>jdk</string>\n\nStep 2\ncd ~/Library\nsudo chmod a+w Application\\ Support\n\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for toggling through input sources not working for more than 2 languages I'm using default keyboard shortcuts on Big Sur to switch between input sources:\n\nAnd I have 3 languages set up (English, Japanese, Korean).

I recently bought an M1 MacBook Air and according to all sources I could find it is supposed to come with macOS Big Sur installed.\nHowever I noticed that my MacBook already came with macOS Monterey installed out of the box! Is this possible?\nBonus Question: Can anyone find a video which shows the first boot sequence without any cuts so that I can compare it to my first boot?\n\nA: A new Mac will always come with the latest version of macOS available when manufactured.  So I would expect any new Mac to come with macOS 12.4, 12.3 or perhaps 12.2 (Monterey).  And you should update it to 12.4.\nThe confusion with Big Sur is because when the M1 MBA was first released it came with, and required, macOS 11 (Big Sur).\n", "Q: Change terminal command prompt on macbook I am new to programming and want to try to change the color of the user at my terminal for the beginning.

The first is bash which was the default shell on OSX 10.3 up to 10.14. The second is zsh which is the current default shell. (Also the first is not correct code in any language there is a missing PS1 and there should be no spaces around =)\nzsh will not read .bash_profile or .profile but just .zshrc\nzsh is very well documented at https://zsh.sourceforge.io/ Prompt is documented here\nThe code given for the second is almost certainly not what you want as the DATE variable is set when the shell starts and you probably want the date and time when the prompt is run.\nAs a disclaimer I don't like most UNIX shells as the syntax is obscure to me as they were designed to let the user type as few characters as possible so I do not fully understand them so I would use non POSIX shells like fish which allows you to set the prompt from a web interface or understandable functions.\nSimple example of the prompt are in the zsh introduction I would start there and build up. There is also zsh prompt generator web site that will allow you to play around with what can be done\nHowever neither of those say anything about colours. For that see the zsh reference This shows that in the prompt %F{white} makes everything after it have white foreground colour. So you example would show white then green then red then white then yellow then reset to remove all colours.\n", "Q: How to fix error NSPOSIXErrorDomain:28 on Safari?

Back in 2017 I purchased a 27\" \"Core i7\" iMac, and opted to get the storage upgrade giving it a 500 GB SSD instead of a hard drive or fusion drive. I'm now considering upgrading the storage, but I'm not sure if the drive is a conventional SATA SSD or a \"blade SSD\" (to use iFixIt.com's terminology) that uses a proprietary connector, which I understand to be similar to but different from NVMe.

What it does show is that Apple used its proprietary 12+16 pin module from \"Generation 3\" (mid-2013) until the introduction of on-board SSD modules.\nSo if your SSD is replaceable, it will almost certainly be a 12+16 pin blade.\nIt may be possible to glean some information from the System Information.app.\nTBH, you'd probably be just as well served by a fast external drive connected via Thunderbolt.\n", "Q: iPad - Transferring files from the \"Files\" app to the \"Photos\" app I would like to transfer all the files in a particular album from the \"Files\" app to the \"Photos\" app on my iPad. I used Airdrop from my MacBook to transfer several video and image files to my iPad. I confirmed the files were sent by viewing some of them. I'm also starting to use Kinemaster for video editing on the iPad. It looks like when I select the \"Video\" tab and \"All\" from the \"Albums\" section of Kinemaster, it only allows me to access albums that were created using the \"Photos\" app.\nThere was no access to anything I had in the \"Files\" app. That would lead me to assume that if I transferred the album of the videos and images from the \"Files\" app into the \"Photos\" app, Kinemaster will have access to them. I selected all of the images and videos in \"Files\" and tapped \"Share\", but did not see \"Photos\" as a target app in the list.

I need to reduce the amount of data on the phone before I can back it up with iTunes.\nI have a Mac Mini 2011 running High Sierra.\nI plugged in and unlocked the iPhone and opened Apple's Image Capture.\nI dragged the photos I wanted to copy to a folder where I wanted to back them up, several thousands at a time (there are over 20'000 photos on the iPhone), and always get errors such as:\n\nI cannot see the list of files that are not transferred (it clips after 5). There is no \"retry\" button or explanation.\nEven when I try dragging smaller batches, I have the error even dragging just one file at a time.\nSometimes the transfer stops because the phone was going to sleep and needing to be unlocked again, which made the process more cumbersome.\nI tried another, third-party app called SendAnywhere which resulted in an error message when attemptimg to transfer over 2'000 photos, but it helped me find out that the files that are not copying with Image Capture are not corrupted because they transferred fine.\nI also wanted to try another 3rd party app called iMazing, but it requires an iTunes backup to work and I don't have enough local hard drive space for that now.\nAlthough I am very curious and intrigued as to why this error occurs on a software created by the company that claims to have invented drag-and-drop (corrupted data on the files? Lightning cable issue? Bad software?), I would very much like to be able to transfer large amounts of data from my phone back to my computer.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: ImageCapture core error 9937 means that the items you are importing are not compatible with your Mac. If your iPhone's iOS version is 11 or later, it may be using HEIF format for photos and HEVC for videos. Depending on which version of High Sierra your Mac has, it may or may not be able to handle these formats. Try this:\nOn iPhone, open Settings > Camera > Formats > select Most Compatible. After this, in Settings > Photos > Transfer to Mac or PC > check mark Automatic.\n\nA: *\n\n*I have always found Dropbox to be more reliable and faster than iCloud\n\n\n*With iOS, you can now plug in external hard drive (or even SD card readers) so you could try doing it old school like that.

Thank you!\n\nA: \"Any other suggestions are welcome.\"\nThe very best answer I can give you is: don't buy a printer that doesn't support Airprint.\nmacOS uses CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System. The current man page for CUPS commands like lpadmin have the following warning:\n\nCUPS printer drivers and backends are deprecated and will no longer be\nsupported in a future feature release of CUPS. Printers that do not\nsupport IPP can be supported using applications such as\nippeveprinter(1).\n\nA more detailed explanation can be found here:\nhttps://www.cups.org/blog/2018-06-06-demystifying-cups-development.html\nIn short, IPP Printing (of which Airprint is a type) is the future of printer connectivity. Printer drivers in their existing form are an old technology that is being phased out.\nHowever, the reason for drivers not working in Monterey is that HP uses kernel extensions in its drivers, which are no longer allowed.\nIt's likely that Windows too will introduce some red lines on older device drivers, due to security problems.\nWhile there might be some merit in extending the life of an existing purchase, buying a printer that does not communicate with your computer natively is no bargain.\nIn fact, it looks like the printer itself is discontinued. (Currently not listed in UK HP on-line store.)\nWhen even the sales-staff are warning you off the product, that should tell you something.\n\nA: This answer demonstrates how to install the driver for your printer using the Mac operating Big Sur. The version of macOS used in the answer is 11.6.1. This answer was also tested using macOS Monterey 12.1 with success. However, the procedures and results were slightly different.\n\nWhen a HP printer is added to the list shown in Printers & Scanners pain of the System Preferences application, the driver chosen by default may not be the newest of the available versions. A newer driver version may be obtained by selecting the driver while manually adding the printer.\n\nI do not have a HP Ink Tank 115. To provide this answer, I will instead substitute an HP Office Pro 8600. Normally the printer would be directly connected to my Mac. However, this would require moving the printer, which I am not will to do in order to answer this question. You can connect your HP Ink Tank 115 to your Mac through a USB cable. I will access the HP Office Pro 8600 through printer sharing with a 2011 iMac named Marlin. The 2011 iMac is using macOS High Sierra 10.13.6\nI started by opening the Printer & Scanners pane of System Preferences. Next I selected the + button to add a printer, then highlighted the Officejet Pro 8600 @ Marlin, as shown below.\n\nI chose Select Software... for \"Use:\" to cause the Printer Software popup to appear, as shown below. Note, the Office Pro 8600 was not listed. Therefore, if I added this printer, the driver from 2011 iMac would have been used. I desired instead to get the driver from HP. At this point, I closed all windows.\n\nBy going to HP's websites, I can determined that I needed download and execute the HP Easy Start application version 2.13.0.220124. Conveniently, the same download is specified for the HP Ink Tank 115. You can confirm the download is the same by going to the link in your question and changing the selection from macOS 10.13 to macOS 11\". The link to download is titled \"Install HP Easy Start\".\nThe following list of items pertain to the execution of the HP Easy Start application.\n\n*\n\n*When asked to \"Select the device you want to use and then click Coninue\", the Office Pro 8600 Marlin was already selected, as shown below.\n\n\n\n*The window below shows the software which was found for the HP Office Pro 8600. Note, installing Essential Software also installs the HP drivers. I chose the default to install the Essential Software and HP Easy Scan. I assume the HP Ink Tank 115 does not scan, so I would assume the HP Easy Scan application would not appear when a HP Ink Tank 115 is selected as the device.\n\n\n\n*The following popup appeared twice, which I allowed.\n\n\n\n*As shown below, there were popups related to system extension(s) from HP, which a I allowed.\n\n\n\n\n*When the popup below appeared, I selected the Not Now button, because the HP Easy Start application had not completed. After this application completed, I restarted the Mac.\n\n\n\n*When the window below appeared, I selected the Add Device... button.\n\n\n\n*When the window below appeared, I did not print a test page. In other words, I did not select the Print Test Page button.\n\n\nUsing the Print Driver Downloaded from HP\nThe printer driver version can be determined by first opening the Printer & Scanners pane of System Preferences. Next, highlight Officejet Pro 8600 @ Marlin in the Printers list, then select the Open Print Queue... button. Finally, select the setting (gear) button to view the driver version under the General tab, as shown below. The print driver version is 4.1.1.\n\nTo switch to the print driver version which was downloaded and installed when the HP Easy Start application was executed, the Officejet Pro 8600 @ Marlin printer would have to be removed from the list, then manually added back in. To insure the print driver downloaded from HP is used, you have select the driver when manually adding the printer, as shown below.\n\nThe image below shows the version of the print driver is now 4.7.0.\n\n\nA: In answer to the the questions:\n\n*\n\n*Install the printer's Windows 10 driver on Windows Parallels and just print from the VM everytime. Yes.\n\n*Same as #1 but with Bootcamp. Yes, but don't.\n\n*Downgrade to macOS 10.15 (this would be my last resort as it's not a very sustainable solution). Yes, but don't.\n\nAnd I will add:\n\n\n*Install macOS 10.15 (or older) in a virtual machine.\n\nI use VMware Fusion (free) rather than Parallels with a High Sierra virtual machine for a Canon scanner.

The Shortcuts app doesn't have access to notifications from other apps.\n", "Q: Help: Mac Finder constantly asks for password when I add/remove tags When I try to add or remove a tag from apps in my Applications folder, it constantly asks for my password to complete the action. This is in reference to apps that I have downloaded – for all apps that came preinstalled, I do not even have the ability to add a tag at all. The strange part is that while Finder almost always asks for my password to alter tags, occasionally it doesn't, and there doesn't seem to be any logic to these instances— it appears random, as far as I can tell. I just want to be able to tag files/apps without constantly having to enter my password. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n(I'm on a 2017 Macbook Pro 13\" running Monterey. I recently had the harddrive wiped by apple when they installed a new battery into this MBPro.)\n\nA: When adding or changing tags, you need to have write permissions on the app. What I have found:\n\n*\n\n*For apps downloaded from the App Store, you do not have write permissions. So you will be asked for an administrator password.\n\n*For many (most?) other apps you will have write permissions.  I think this is true for apps that you installed by a simple copy or move to /Applications.\n\n*For other apps with more complex installations may well not have permissions and so need an administrator password.\n\n*For apps which are installed as part of macOS (Mail, Music, News, etc.) you will not be allowed to add tags, even with administrator privileges, because they are located in the read only system volume.\n\nThis is the correct behaviour and is consistently applied - just depending on permissions or read-only volume.\nBefore someone asks \"Why tag applications?\":\nI make much use of tags on applications. I do this to classify apps (e.g. photo apps) and have custom searches to find all apps in each classification. Multiple tags allows apps to have more than one classification. Like this:\n\nBut, I have found an annoyance (which I don't understand) regarding tags on applications. When using Finder's Column View:\n\n*\n\n*Select an app with tags and for which I do not have write permissions;\n\n*Select another app;\n\n*This brings up the administrator password request even though I am not changing any tags.\n\n", "Q: revert back to the default terminal z shell I accidentally changed my default macOS z shell to bash shell.

So I'm working on a project to convert Spotify to Apple Music playlists and I'm utilizing AppleScript to do so.

For example, it needs Library to search through the users library. I cannot find a parameter to search through all of Apple Music though. Any ideas?\n\nA: I like this shortcut since it works on iOS and macOS and you can inspect the API usage before importing it.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cbdbcde5659b41c2928aec4b42567662\nIt has a note on who made it and a tutorial on YouTube.

As for auto-dismissal, I'm unaware of such a setting.\n", "Q: Large Apple Music MacOS library on external SSD - taking hours to save library on quit - how to troubleshoot? I have a large music library (200GB/14.000 tracks), with files spanning well over a decade. I'm on a temporary Mac for the next month or two, so I'm keeping the files and library on an extremely fast external SSD (Sandisk Extreme Pro - Thunderbolt 3).\nWhen I quit the Music app on macOS, a popup alert window that reads \"Saving Music Library...\" appears, and then just... doesn't go away. The program is not unresponsive according to the Finder/the Force Quit dialogue.\nIt's just trying to save, and it's taking forever.\nI don't know if this is an SSD issue or not.\nThe library contains thousands of hours of work, so I'm apprehensive about cutting down the library.\nSetup:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro M1 Max\n\n*64GB memory\n\n*Music Version 1.2.4.\n\nAs a layman, I would hope I could look at logs or something, to see what may be causing these delays.  Is there a way to isolate or troubleshoot this sort of problem?\n\nA: I would probably try to separate the data (music and video) files from your library (playlist / ratings / index of tracks database) files.\n\n*\n\n*put the database files that need fast access on the fast disk (so saves and changes to playlists are fast)\n\n*put the files that play the music on slow access. You won’t notice slowness as they rarely get written, can be buffered for seamless playback and won’t slow down launch or quitting the app one bit.\n\nWould a process like this work for you?\nThe idea is to move just the itl and metadata files back into the internal drive / your hoke folder and keep the data files on the external drive.\nAlso, before you start this - have you backed up your entire external drive so you are protected if it crashes or is failing to write which could cause that large slowdown.\n\nA: I believe this is a bug in music that I'm trying to track down.\nTry the following.\nOpen Music in \"Safe Mode\". Hold Option and Command when launching it.\nThen, turn off \"Keep Music Folder Organized\" in Music -> Settings -> Files.\nQuit Music. Does it still happen?\nWhen you open Music again, re-check the \"Keep Music Folder Organized\" as I find that it keeps re-enabling itself.\n", "Q: Get MacBook Pro M1 to consistantly order 2 identical monitors I have an M1 MacBook Pro. I have two 27\" HP E27u G4 monitors each connected directly to it via USB-C cables.\nEvery time the Mac sleeps (turns off the displays?), when I wake it up it will randomly assign one monitor to the left and one to the right. Meaning, 50% of the time I have to go into System Preferences and manually swap the position of the monitors.\nThe same thing happens if I disconnect and reconnect them even though I always reconnect them in the same order (first left monitor -> top usb-c port, then right monitor -> bottom usb-c port) on the side of the mac that has 2 usb-c ports.\nHow can I get the Mac to remember the order of the monitors?\n\nA: I suffer from a very similar problem. My MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021), with Apple M1 Max CPU and macOS Monterey 12.6, is similarly unreliable about assigning the left and right external monitors. They are both BenQ EX2780Q models. In my case, the Mac gets it right about 80% of the times it awakes from sleep. When it gets it wrong, I have a couple of workarounds which are usually effective. But it is very annoying.\nMy two monitors are side-by-side, above the MacBook Pro's built-in display. The left-hand monitor connects via Thunderbolt 3 cable to a Thunderbolt port on the left of the MacBook Pro. The right-hand monitor connects via an HDMI cable to an HDMI port on the right of the MacBook Pro. Normally, the Display Preferences UI labels the left-hand monitor \"BenQ EX2780Q (1)\", and the right-hand monitor \"BenQ EX2780Q (2)\".\nWhat I observe is that, when the Mac wakes from sleep, or wakes the monitors from sleep after I have not used them in a while, there is a period of 5-15 seconds when the displays show messages or images, then go black, then display images again. Eventually both monitors show desktop images. I can move my pointer from built-in display to display (1) to display (2). About 80% of the time, the Mac picks the left-hand monitor to be display (1), and the right to be display (2). The rest of the time, it reverses this assignment.\nI can tell which outcome I have, even before I enter my password to remove the display lock, by moving my pointer upwards from the built-in MacBook display to display (1). When things are correct, the pointer arrives on the left-hand monitor. When things are wrong, it arrives on the right-hand monitor.\nIn Display Preferences, macOS always depicts display (1) on the left and display (2) on the right, even when it has got them swapped in real life. I can confirm this by displaying different desktop images on each monitor. The Display Preferences UI shows the desktop images.\nMy primary workaround is, when the displays awake and before I enter my password to the display lock, to move the pointer up and sideways. This lets me tell if the displays are assigned in reverse. If they are, I press the \"Cancel\" button (or press the Escape key), and the displays go back to sleep. I wait a second and try again. It seems like the Mac rolls the dice on mis-assigning the displays each time it wakes. But, it has a bias to keep the assignment it currently has, even if it is wrong. Sometimes, the second try is correct. Sometimes I need to try 10 times.\nIf that fails, my second workaround is to unplug the cable to my right-hand monitor, the one I want to be display (2). Then I wake up the Mac. It has no choice but to make my left-hand monitor be display (1). Then I plug in the cable to my right-hand monitor. It becomes display (2), as I want it to be. The downside of this trick is that, once I unlock my screen, I usually discover that my application windows are on the wrong display.\nI tried using displayplacer. It is \"a command line utility to configure multi-display resolutions and arrangements.\" I got it via MacPorts. Displayplacer lets you assign display rotation, resolution, and relative position, using ID numbers which are supposed to be unique and unchanging. For instance, you could command (I shortened id numbers and added line breaks for clarity):\ndisplayplacer \"id:1817…1F30+F466…DECD res:1440x900 scaling:on origin:(0,0) degree:0\" \n  \"id:4C40…22BB res:768x1360 hz:60 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(1440,0) degree:90\" \n  \"id:A46D2F5E-487B-CC69-C588-ECFD519016E5 mode:3 origin:(-1440,0) degree:270\"\n\nWhat disappointed me about displayplacer is that those ID numbers are not attached to the physical monitors. Instead, they appear attached to macOS's idea of \"display (1)\" and \"display (2)\". When macOS reverses the assignments, it reverses the relationship of ID number to physical monitor as well. I suppose I could come up with two scripted invocations of displayplacer: one to reverse relative positions of the displays in response to macOS reversing the assignments, and one to correctly position the displays in response to macOS later getting the assignments right. I will leave someone else to write the answer which shows how to do this.\n", "Q: Data migration from 2015 BigSur MBP to 2021 M1 MBP I want to migrate all data from my existing 2015 MBP that runs on Big Sur to the latest 2021 MBP with M1 Pro chip.\nI want to be able to transfer all files and all settings to the new MBP and this includes the hidden .ssh folders, /etc/hosts files, to name a few.\nI have read about Migration Assistant being able to do this over Wifi but quite unsure if all the data & apps will get transferred or not OR if it cause issues because the OS versions will be different.\nCan I use CarbonCopyCloner and \"clone\" my old OS + data on the new M1 MBP which runs on a new version of MacOS? Which OS would be present after cloning? Would the new OS cause issues especially since I am on an Intel MBP.\nI will have only a weekend to complete this process before I have to ship my old MBP so looking for best practices from people who have completed this process before.\nBasically want an exact copy of what I currently have in my 2015 MBP to avoid any troubles with office work.\n\nA: I would recommend against cloning your old disk to boot from it, it may very well not work. But Migration Assistant is the way to go, it's acually quite capable to copy both your data and any applications over. Apple has a support document describing the details.\nSo what I would do in your case:\n\n*\n\n*get an external SSD (USB disk) and clone your old MBP disk onto this with CCC. This will then be your backup disk in case the migration partially fails but you still need to give the old MBP back\n\n*run Migration Assistant to copy everything over the new MBP. Depending on the amount of data you have this may take a while over WiFi\n\n*install Rosetta 2 on the new MBP (because at least some of the applications you copied over may still be using Intel code)\n\n*upgrade Applications to their newest version if possible\n\n\nA: Trust me - Migration assistant is the way to go. I've made countless transitions (I use my Time Machine Backup to restore the data), and you just migrate, set your account's password, enter your apple password, and boom, your mac is just like before. I will say that there is one caveat: the apps lose their permissions. For example, if you use screen sharing on zoom, you will have to re-allow zoom to screen share. But other than that, it's as seamless as it can be. I've dealt with all this cloning disks stuff in the past, and i've really regretted just not using migration assistant. Trust me, with apple today, you do NOT need to clone stuff like how you do in windows for a seamless transition.\nTl;dr: just use migration assistant. Either use an ethernet/usb cable between the macs or restore using a time machine backups.\n\nA: Can I use CarbonCopyCloner and \"clone\" my old OS + data?\nNow that the OS is on a separate, sealed, read-only volume, there is absolutely no need to clone the OS from your old Mac. I certainly wouldn't 'down-grade' the OS from the factory install, either, even if possible.\nCloning the \"Macintosh HD (Data)\" volume is an option, but I'd caution that going from an old Intel Mac to an M1, there may be differences in configuration files. I cloned my 2012 Mini to a T2-chip 2018 Mini, and that didn't work without reinstalling the OS, and sorting out authorisation keys or something.\n\nA: To the caveat that anonymous mentioned, above, I would add that Migration Assistant is known to blow away all the original timestamps on your files, and reset them to the time that you migrated.\nIf you, like many people, want to sort your files in the order they were created, Migration Assistant may disappoint you, or, worse, it may make a total mess of your Documents and Downloads folders.\n", "Q: error 4046 restoring ipad gen 6 I'm trying to restore two iPads 6th generation but getting the same error for both and they're both stuck in restore mode (support.apple.com/ipad/restore with the cable and an laptop icon on a black screen).\nWhen I connect the iPad to my MacBook the iPad shows up in Finder but I only get a loading screen there.\nGoogle search only brought up this thread on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/rzvkze/does_anyone_recognize_this_error_code_4046_i_cant/\nAny idea how to bring them back to life?\nMacBook Info: MacBook Pro (Early 2015), macOS Monterey Version 12.3\nBoth iPads were on iPadOS 15.5\n\nA: You should consider experimenting with Apple Configurator to see if you can reset the iPads through the interface it provides.

Hopefully someone will come along with a better answer. In the meantime, the adventurous can read on…\nYour Wordle statistics are saved in local storage, which is set per website, so what you need to do is basically find the statistics in the local storage of the old website and copy them to the local storage of the new website. There is no nice way to do this through an UI, but it can be done programmatically if you know how. You will need a Mac desktop/laptop in addition to your iPhone. Here are the steps:\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone, go to Settings > Safari > Advanced and toggle on Web Inspector\n\n\n*If you haven't already, save the new NYT Wordle page to your home screen\n\n\n*Open the old Wordle app from your home screen\n\n\n*Plug your iPhone into your Mac\n\n\n*Open Safari on your Mac, and click the Develop menu at the top\n\n*\n\n*if you don't see the Develop menu, you need to enable it at Preferences > Advanced > Show develop menu in menu bar\n\n\n\n*In the Develop menu, you should see your iPhone listed with a flyout menu that includes pages open on your iPhone; click on www.nytimes.com\n\n*\n\n*if you don't see your device listed, you probably didn't trust the device when you plugged it in; unplug it and replug it in, and click the button to trust the device\n\n*if you don't see www.nytimes.com as an option, make sure you have the old Wordle app open on your iPhone (with iPhone unlocked)\n\n*if you see two www.nytimes.com entries, one is the new app and one is the old one; you can figure out which one is the old one by hovering over the menu items on your Mac – if you're hovering the one you have pulled up on your iPhone, you should see a semi-transparent blue overlay on your iPhone\n\n\n\n*A Web Inspector window appears on your Mac. Now we need to get the statistics from local storage. Ultimately, we will need to copy these to another window, but Safari's console isn't the greatest, so we need to take a couple extra steps to allow easy copying.\n\n\n*Click the Console tab at the top of the Web Inspector and enter this code in the console (press Enter key after each line):\n let div = document.createElement('div');\n\n div.textContent = window.localStorage.getItem('nyt-wordle-statistics');\n\n div\n\n\n\n*You'll see <div>…</div> print in the console with a little caret next to it.

I tried removing it and adding it again but to no avail.\nHow can I bring that functionality back?\n\n\n\n\nA: I was able to fix it but I think it's a bug.\nFix was to enable Select the previous input source option in Keyboard shortcut settings then using the shortcut (normally it's control + space)\nThe language switcher pop up was shown and this time it actually included the missing keyboard (Persian). Now even using the fn (globe) key, It shows properly.\nAfter that I disabled the keyboard shortcut again and the pop up kept working as intended.\n", "Q: Will iPads with non-M1 chip be able to run iOS apps written for M1 chip in the future? In the news I see that software written for macOS and Intel-based CPU should be optimized to run on M1 chip. I have also already seen some apps for macOS which only run on M1 chips.\nI want to buy an iPad and it seems the entry level iPad has a non-M1 chip while more expensive ones such as the current generation iPad Air and iPad Pro has M1 chip.\nShould apps written for non-M1 chip based iPad be optimized for M1 chip based iPads? In other words, the fragmentation we see in the macOS over its CPU will lead to developers to update and develop their software for M1 chip only. Will we see the same trend for iPads? Will an iPad with non-M1 chip receive iOS updates as long as its predecessors?\n\nA: Ipad and mac computers are totally different things.\npre M1 iPads still run an ARM cpu. The M1 is just a better version of existing iPad CPUs.\nThe issue of changing from Intel to ARM (Apple Silicon/M1) does not exist for devices running formas of iOS.\nSo updates in iPadOS will just follow normal Apple ways. At some date the newest version of iPadOS will not run on an old iPad.  I suspect the entry level iPad having the earlier ARM cpu will not upgrade to the latest iPadOS one version before the M1 iPads.\n", "Q: Automator Applescript - How to click the second checkbox I recorded a workflow with Automator.

On iPhone, there is a physical switch on the left side of the device for turning on “Silent Mode”. This mode does not disable all sounds. For example, if you open YouTube in Safari and play a video, it will produce sound.\nBy definition, “silent” means “not making or accompanied by any sound”, so Silent Mode is a lie. It doesn’t stop all sounds but only some sounds.\nWhat I want is to stop all sound, regardless of where it is coming from. I actually don’t understand the use-case for Silent Mode. If I’m at a meeting and don’t want my phone to produce sound, turning on Silent Mode is not enough, so what’s the point?\nIs it possible to stop an iPhone from producing any sound?\n\nA: You can set Do Not Disturb Focus mode from Control Center to silence calls, alerts and notifications.\nYou can create a Personal Automation Shortcut to trigger when you turn Focus on and have that Shortcut set the system volume (in the Media category) to zero which will silence music and videos. You can also have the Shortcut turn any alarms off using the Get all alarms action (from Clock) then a Repeat loop containing the Toggle alarm action configured to off.\nI think this should silence everything. You will have to manually turn any alarms back on if you want them on though.\n", "Q: Error 1643 The file at 0x0025a48f could not be archived I recently upgraded to Monterey (on my 2015 MBP) and have been occasionally getting the following message popping up.\nError 1643 The file at 0x0025a48f could not be archived\nI have tried to track down the app causing it but have been unsuccessful so far. It's honestly more of an irritant than anything as nothing seems to be obviously broken however still would be nice to fix. Any thoughts?\n\nA: I had this problem recently and it was an absolute nightmare to track down, firstly are you running CrashPlan Enterprise (I think can also be called Cloud or Small Business or something else along those lines)? If you are not then I'm afraid this is probably not the solution that you are looking for.\nTLDR;\nRun the following curl command on a machine in a known good state, compare it to yours and then make the required changes.\n    curl --insecure -X GET \"https://localhost:4244/v1/ApplicationStatus\" -G -d 'query=list+config+where+version=v6.9.4'\n\nBackground\nFirstly a bit of background, CrashPlan is essentially made of two components, a Service and a UI. The UI is built using the Electron framework, I believe this used to be a Java app (and you can tell the age of your install by this). The service is pretty much what does all of the work, and it hosts an API (on a webserver) that is listening port 4244. We can talk to this API to find out what is going and to try to work out what is broken. If you are interested in looking at what API routes are available (and what calls get made etc) you can look into the UI's App.asar file (its all of the compressed JS that make up an Electron app), reading that is how I worked all of this. What appears to happen is during the upgrade very occasionally some configuration gets corrupted or deleted, really not sure why (I wasn't able to find a root cause for that).\nHow to solve\nStep 1\nWe need to check the configuration from a machine (in your company) that you know is working, that way you can diff the two configs and work out what is missing on the machine that is broken.\nWe need to query the runtime configuration from the known good host. Use the following curl command to send a request to the internal API to retrieve the runtime configuration. This uses the internal endpoint v1/ApplicationStatus to query the config that is currently being used. It will be returned in JSON and you can use jq to format it nicely if you so desire.\n    curl --insecure -X GET \"https://localhost:4244/v1/ApplicationStatus\" -G -d 'query=list+config+where+version=v6.9.4'\n\nStep 2\nRun the above curl command on the host where you are getting the error message. Hopefully this should return a config that it different to the one above, or if you are lucky it will point you the config that is either missing or is incorrect.\nStep 3\nAdd whatever is missing (or needs to be removed) from the runtime configuration to the configuration file /Library/Application Support/CrashPlan/conf/my.service.xml\nStep 4\nReboot the machine and problem should go away\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Finder not filtering searches when pressing 'Enter' What I'm trying to achieve: Search through a bunch of files using the search bar in Finder.\nHow I tried to achieve it: By typing a word into the Finder search bar and pressing 'Enter'\nHow the system reacted unexpectedly: It did not filter by the search word I entered. It did not filter at all. As you can see in the first picture there are files appearing without the word \"introduction\". That should not be happening.\n\nIn order to get the desired result I have to type in the search word and then click the option that drops down from the search bar.\n\nWhy doesn't the first method not work and how can I fix this?\n\nA: The two searches you show work differently:\n\n*\n\n*The first approach searches for the search terms within all files (so it looks at files content).\n\n*The second approach searching for matching file names.\n\n", "Q: Mac Mini mid 2011 - any way to keep the analog audio input out of power saving mode? This machine (mid-2011 with 10.16 retrofit) is used as a HTPC/media player in a somewhat interference-rich environment.\nAs long as there is some kind of media playback active, even if it is video with a silent audio track, all is fine. However, a few seconds after no longer playing back anything, it appears the sound circuitry powers down leaving the output in a somewhat high-impedance state, leading to all kinds of noise being picked up by the analog wiring (ticking noises that appear to be from some SMPS in the system if not using an audio isolation transformer, hum injected into the same transformer if using one). Is there some hidden software option to simply keep the sound circuitry on line (actively outputting silence) at all times?\n\nA: Perhaps out of left field, untested & not free [though free trial to test]…\nI wonder if something like a dither will keep the audio alive sufficiently to do this.\nYou could test SoundSource with an AU dither plugin, maybe this from Airwindows - https://www.airwindows.com/tpdf-dither/ which seems to have a freeware license.\nI'm not quite sure how you'd set it in practise; perhaps set your Mac's audio out to 24-bit & set the dither to 16-bit, That would mean it's always doing 'something' to the bottom 8-bits [unless it's smart enough to stop processing when its not getting signal.]\nI can't test any of this theory, as I don't suffer from the symptom. I use a hardware S/PDIF > analog 5.1 converter on my HTPC Mac, for other reasons. If no joy, that could be another alternative to try out. You can get these generic converters for about $£€ 25 on eBay/Amazon. They're 'good enough'.\nYou could also try ferrite beads [a few quid/bucks/shekels on eBay] - placed toward the signal input end - but I'm less convinced this is the panacea people would have you believe. It should work to some extent on high-frequencies, but not so much broad-spectrum.\n", "Q: What stylii will work with a 1st gen iPad mini? I have a 1st gen iPad mini A1454 running iOS 9.3.6 and I would like to know what my options are when choosing a stylus. I know that Apple Pencil and compatible products will definitely not work, but that leaves both Bluetooth styluses and universal ones as options. Bluetooth styluses should work with select apps that support them (I have Brushes Redux installed). However, in an answer to a similar question someone writes that there's also apparently a minimum Bluetooth version required to support those, which an older iPad may not have the hardware for.

The day after I installed it I had four kernel panics in rapid succession in the space of a half hour. Since then I have had more. Sometimes a day goes by without one, sometimes there are several in a day. I have read and, for the most part, followed this:\nIf Your Mac Restarts and a Message Appears\nThe Kernel-YYYY-MM-DD-hhmmss.panic logs (/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/) offer no clues as to what software/hardware might be causing the panics\nSo far I have:\n• Removed an external display and adapter\n• Removed a USB hub\n• Notremoved a non-Apple (Logitech) keyboard as the machine would be useless without it.\n• Not removed an external drives as the machine would be useless to me without them\nI started the machine in Recovery Mode and:\n• Ran Disk First aid on the boot volume: No problems found\n• Reinstalled MacOS\nI started the machine in Diagnostics Mode and ran diagnostics: No problems found\nThe only extensions I have are those installed by:\n• Graphic Converter\n• Bartender\n• Dropbox\n• Google Drive\n• Markup\nThe external drives that I have not removed have all been running fine on the machine for well over a year.

What I really didn't expect was what a slug the machine was in Safe Mode. It was barely useable. Instead of moving across the screen smoothly, the pointer moved in fits and starts. In text fields the insertion point simply disappeared now and then. I tried to use the machine that way, but was actually grateful when a kernel panic rebooted the machine in regular mode and the machine returned running as smoothly as normal. So weird. Is Safe Mode always like that?\n\nA: You've enabled kernel symbolication and we have found that it doesn't provided a human-readable backtrace. The possibilities for this are that (1) Apple has suddenly removed symbolication capability (unlikely), or (2) the addresses belong to a range that didn't map to a symbolicated region of the code. Neither of these would be expected behavior in this situation.\nFurthermore, I'm not aware of any publicly available tools for decoding the macOSProcessedStackshotData field of the report, which might have turned up something actionable.\nNevertheless, we have some useful information even without symbols:\n\n*\n\n*All four of your panic reports include the following identical signature:\n\nMachine-check capabilities: 0x0000000000000c0a\nfamily: 6 model: 158 stepping: 9 microcode: 240\nsignature: 0x906e9\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-7500 CPU @ 3.40GHz\n10 error-reporting banks\nProcessor 0: IA32_MCG_STATUS: 0x0000000000000005\nIA32_MC0_STATUS(0x401): 0xb200000000030005\n\n\nThis signature means that your problem belongs to a class of panic called a Machine Check Exception (MCE), which is initiated in x86 silicon rather than by xnu. So, in all likelihood, the displayed backtrace would just show the MCE AST panic handler and indicate nothing about the origin of the MCE. This is strongly suggested by the fact that subtracting the KASLR slide from each of the frame return addresses yields an identical inner stack:\n\n0xffffffxxxxxxxxxx : 0xffffffxxxxx81c8d\n0xffffffxxxxxxxxxx : 0xffffffxxxxxe1596\n0xffffffxxxxxxxxxx : 0xffffffxxxxxd0963\n0xffffffxxxxxxxxxx : 0xffffffxxxxx21a70\n0xffffffxxxxxxxxxx : 0xffffffxxxxx8205d\n0xffffffxxxxxxxxxx : 0xffffffxxxxx81816\n0xffffffxxxxxxxxxx : 0xffffffxxxxx15163\n0xffffffxxxxxxxxxx : 0xffffffxxxxxd19d7\n0xffffffxxxxxxxxxx : 0xffffffxxxxx1c94c\n0xffffffxxxxxxxxxx : 0xffffffxxxxx222cf\n\n\nThat's the pattern in 3 of the 4 panics. The 4th one (Kernel-2022-05-27-160805.panic) appeared to have been in the middle of another operation when the AST occurred. It might have been marginally useful to know what it was doing but I'm guessing just machine_idle() or something like that.\nIn other words: The backtraces aren't useful in this case.\n\n\n*Taking a look at Intel's Software Developer's Manual, Vol. 4, Ch 15-16, your report consistently shows that the first core-local MCA register (MC0) on your BSP (Processor 0) has an uncorrected internal parity error (0xb...05). What's more, the CPU wasn't able (or it didn't make sense) to identify an address that was associated with that error, so there is no IA32_MC0_ADDR register value to examine. The model-specific error code (0x...3...) is not decodable through public documentation so we don't know what it means for your specific CPU (Core i5-7500).\n\n\n*The fact that all four signatures are identical means that your issue is due to a specific, reproducible root cause.\nAnd yet, despite these important clues, we simply don't have enough information or debugging tools available to get any more granular data on what the cause could be. MCE root causes span the entirety of hardware, firmware, and software – a bug in any of those can manifest as an MCE. Due to the low-level nature of MCEs and the fact that they halt CPU execution, the amount of useful diagnostic data that is able to be collected from a closed system at runtime from this generation Intel core is very limited (as compared to an \"ordinary\" kernel panic, when the CPU continues to fetch & execute instructions and xnu is often able to continue running to significant extent, allowing for interactive debugging).\nWhat this means for you is that we're sort of stuck grasping at straws on our own. You indicate that you've done some hardware isolation experiments. There are only a couple of minor things I can think of there:\n\n*\n\n*What interface(s) (cable(s)) are you using to connect your external drive(s) to your Mac?\n\n*Can you try running in Safe Mode (hold Shift during boot) for a while and see if the panic goes away completely or still recurs?\n\n*Can you try running an extended memory test? (Download the free version and dd the memtest86-usb.img image onto a flash drive, then boot from it.) Apple Diagnostics often misses errors that MemTest86 catches so run that and see if you get any errors (it'll take a while!).\n\n\nA: tl;dr - If you got here by searching on \"kernel panics\" the short answer is that there are many things you can do to suss out the cause of kernel panics; none of which worked for me.\nIf you really want to go through all this, then read the excellent and informative comments by pion as well as the extensive suggestions in his answer to the question.\n", "Q: Where do I find the language icon change mention that happened in macOS 12.4 upgrade?

Other answer were vague or wrong. Now I know I should use pfctl but I failed doing it several times.\nCan someone please tell me how to redirect a LAN port to a local port? Thanks!\n\nA: As you say, your router is acting as a DHCP server and the DHCP data includes setting your DNS server to the router (in your case 192.168.1.1).\nMy router gives out 192.168.0.1 as the DNS server, but I have overridden that to use 127.0.0.1:\n\nYou can set the DNS Server in the Advanced... options. Use the + and - to add and remove DNs addresses, so that you get this:\n\nThen you will discover if you have configured your DNS server correctly!!\nI don't why or how you are building your DNS server, but my use case is to a) hide DNS traffic from my service provider and b) to block on trackers.  Rather than building a DNS server or resolver from scratch, I have used DNSCrypt Proxy and more recently Adguard Home.\nIn the above I have, like the questioner, used the term \"DNS Server\" even though that should strictly be \"DNS Resolver\".\n\nA: You cannot redirect to 127.0.0.1 because that's internet shorthand for \"me\".\nYou need to set your DHCP server to broadcast the correct DNS IP Address, at your router - that's where all computers will look for an authoritative answer as to where DNS is.\nNote if your own server isn't correctly updating from a more authoritative server outside your LAN, you may get failures.\n", "Q: Moving from Windows to Mac...a few questions on data migration I was using Bootcamp on an iMac27 (2017) for a variety of reasons I decided to go back to using Mac natively.

The key data I'll be reading/writing from the Drobo is large Lightroom raw photo data (about 1.2TB)\nanything Im missing?\n\nA: macOS can read but not write NTFS natively.\nThere are freeware solutions to this, but I would recommend Paragon's NTFS for Mac for trouble-free operation.\nIf you're accessing the Drobo over the network, then the Drobo itself should be responsible for handling read/write, not the Mac.\n", "Q: iOS 15.5 Auto Update causing wifi drops with router Last night Apple auto-updated my iPhone 8 Plus and installed iOS 15.5. I've gone through many such updates for years with no problems. Beginning today with the first use of my iPhone, the WiFi connection dropped repeatedly.  I went to Settings and turned WiFi off and then back on and reestablished a connection, but it lasted only a short time -- maybe 15 seconds -- and then dropped again.\nI've tested all other devices served by the router and my updated iPhone is the only one with this problem.\nRouter is ASUS RTN66R  Double 450 Mbps N Router.  Serving 6 devices.\n\nA: One thing to try is to go to Settings > WiFi > tap the information icon on the WiFi network, then Forget the WiFi network and recreate it.\nIn most cases when I've had funky WiFi problems, simply tearing down and rebuilding the WiFi helps tremendously.\n", "Q: Possible to restore Appkit after Catalina→Monterey Update? I'm hoping someone might be able to help me, but I'm aware it might be a long-shot.\nI've come to rely on an app called Auganizer which has been completely abandoned by its developers.\nAfter upgrading from Catalina to Monterey, I get the following error when trying to launch it:\nTermination Reason:    Namespace DYLD, Code 4 Symbol missing\nSymbol not found: _OBJC_IVAR_$_NSActionCell._tag\nReferenced from: /Users/USER/Desktop/Auganizer.app/Contents/MacOS/Auganizer\nExpected in: /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/AppKit\n(terminated at launch; ignore backtrace)\n\nThere is no Appkit at all in /System/Library/Frameworks/, but there is one in the equivalent directory of the Time Machine backup of my Catalina system.\nIs there any way to restore this file or some other way to fix the missing symbol error?\n\nA: It looks like Auganizer binary is linked to Appkit by the hardcoded path, and when Monterey moved Appkit into dylib shared cache it became unavailable for the apps, which are trying to find it by the file system path. So in order to make it work it will be necessary to modify the import section of Auganizer and its libs to make it use Appkit from dylib shared cache.\nSo you'll have the hacked binaries with the broken digital signtures. Also even if you change the paths there, you may stumble into some symbol which was deprecated and no longer exist in Monterey version of AppKit, so it will be necessary to find the analog.\nTo mee it doesn't look reasonable to spent so much time on reviving the 35$ software.\n", "Q: How can I find out the destination server of a VPN connection's utun interface? When connected to my VPN (in this case using the OpenVPN app Viscosity) it creates a utun interface that looks like this when queried using ifconfig utun10:\nutun10: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    inet 10.20.0.30 --> 10.20.0.30 netmask 0xffff0000\n    inet6 aaaa::bbbb:cccc:dddd:eeee%utun10 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x17\n    inet6 ffff:aaaa:bbbb:cccc::dddd prefixlen 64\n    nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\n\nFrom the command line or (better yet) programmatically, is there any way I can figure out the hostname or IP address of the VPN server that's on the other end of utun10?\n\nA: The best / worst you can do from the tunnel is get the routing for all networks that that tunnel has established:\nnetstat -lnI utun10\n\nIt should track closely to what you see for the ifconfig on the routing. It’s not really possible to deduce from which gateway you brought up this tunnel since you contacted the VPN server on another interface (likely en0) if you have one Ethernet only built in on the Mac. So the short answer to your question is that information isn’t retrievable from utunX\nYou will need to get at the logs of your VPN client and/or run netstat on another interface to see which gateway takes the tunneled traffic.\nHere is the information for the mac client I think you are using:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.sparklabs.com/support/kb/article/logs-and-information-to-provide-support-staff/\nOnce you have that application log, you might be able to search in console.app if it perhaps logs to the unified database / file storage logs on macOS. Worst case, you need that client (or another client) to log connection details so you can automate scripting your query.\n", "Q: Κeyboard shortcut to switch to a specific input source For a multilingual user, with 3 or 4 everyday-use languages, is it possible to press a keyboard shortcut to change to a pre-set language?\nFor example, CMD+1 will be English, CMD+2 will be German, CMD+3 will be Russian.\nFor my needs, the specific shortcut or specific language is not relevant, but just want to avoid the frustrating sequential press of the regular language switch keyboard-shortcut in order to achieve the needed input source.\nAlso, if it's possible to find some solution which is not a keyboard shortcut, but for example a trackpad gesture - it will be fine.\n\nA: You can probably use Kawa for this.\n", "Q: MAC Other Volume Issue I am new to MAC and having issue with my Mac.

My MacBook needed repairs and the employee asked to log out of iCloud. I did and when I got my laptop repaired and back, I now have two MacBooks registered on my account in the Apple Store. They replaced the logic board, but I wondering about the old logic board and I am wondering if logging out of iCloud was necessary and if I can trust them with my old logic board and if they can access personal data on there?\n\nA: Trust is more about your threat model and risk than the policy they train to IMO.\n\n*\n\n*Can I trust Apple support and share my password?\n\n*Can I trust Apple Store's employees with my laptop?\nHere are some observations:\n\n*\n\n*Apple Service employees are trained in privacy and data protection. They do have access to sales and service records. This access is logged and audited regularly. Apple has a history of weeding out rogue employees that don’t care about the rules (which is of no solace to anyone whose trust does get abused or privacy violated).\n\n*Signing out of iCloud and find my removes the activation lock functionality that is critical for a logic board swap to progress smoothly while in the shop.\n\n*Your storage contains all data - the logic board does not store files or personal data past what they already had available (which is the unique ID of the logic board or network hardware adapters).\n\n*Service employees can not look up your password - you have to give it to them.\n\n*Service employees have the tools, training and opportunity to copy and retain all data you deliver to them.\n\n*You can encrypt and erase the data - steps vary - ask them about how to know and learn this before you make a decision what to hand off to service staff.\n\n*It looks like they followed all the steps for service - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209095\nMy experience is Apple support goes out of their way to educate you if you ask. They have service records with the old and new serial, so I wouldn’t worry much. Change your password if you gave it to them and study up before the next repair so you don’t have nagging doubt you made an error. I don’t think you did, but it’s hard to tell based on no details of macOS version, hardware type and what you chose to secure your Mac and what passwords (if any) you provided to them.\n", "Q: Why did Apple refuse to refund a scam app? Apple website and staff refused twice to refund a Chinese video-editing app called 爱编辑. Then they won't accept request.\nIt's a scam app; numerous people commented in the app store about the scam to no avail. When you open this Mac app, there is only one button, which asks you to buy. Cancel doesn't work. It will ask buy again if you click the only existent button.

By the way, the app can't function normally.\nI reached for Apple's help immediately and multiple times to no avail.

I had a stable running 10.13 with a metal supported gpu but I wanted to clone the drive as I move into Mojave. So I thought, oh I’ll start it up on an old hard drive running 10.8.5 and do the cloning there. After the cloning, I’ll reboot in 10.13 and head to Mojave.  So I went into sys prefs and selected the old 10.8 hard drive and rebooted. That was a bad idea. Nothing. It doesn’t do anything except chime… nothing ever comes up on the monitor. 10.8 must be too old for my gpu upgrades.\nWith my upgraded gpu, I no longer have access to any of the apple menus that you can trigger by holding different keyboard buttons upon boot. You know the ones that allow you to choose a boot drive, target mode, etc…\nI’m stuck in 10.8 and can’t get back into 10.13.    Can I just remove the drive with 10.8 and restart and the Mac go into my 10.13 drive? I’ve tried holding option and trying to blind guess into the other boot drive but no luck.\n\nA: Removing the 10.8.5 drive should allow the Mac to find the 10.13 one again. It might take a little longer as it hunts for it. As you can't check progress, don't press anything, just let it search. Once booted, re-select it in Startup Disk.\nAfter that, just clone right from that drive.

Newbie here,\nI recently transitioned from Windows to Apple, and need someone to take me by hand and guide me through the process of how to click the \"Reconnect\" button (see screenshot) that appears after the 'Microsoft Remote Desktop' has been disconnected due to the MacBook going into sleep mode.\nOnce I got the script, I will need to find a way to either a) manually, or even better b) automatically run it whenever I resume work (emerging from sleep mode).\nAnyone who can give me a hand here?\n\nSubsequently, I adjusted my script as follows.

versions of MacOS and/or Apple hardware (from here on just “Macs”):\nThere is empirical evidence that newer Macs do not play nicely with the implementation of WPA3 in some routers. Check wether there is a firmware update for your router and install it, at least restart.\nWPA3 should be configured on your router to grant access to a WLAN, but if you observe connectivity problems, switch if possible to WPA3/WPA2 transitional (or similiar name).\nConsistency of your Wifi connection can be impacted by the default MTU size used by Macs. Changing the MTU size to 1453 (via System Preferences>Network>Advanced>Configure>Manually) usually solves this issue.\nAdditionally turning off Private Relay on some Macs improves the stability of the connection.\nLastly it seems to help to overwrite the airport preferences and network settings. You can achieve that by setting the MTU or turning off Private Relay,etc. Or you just delete a related plist(s) and force the OS that way to write/save them again according to your adjustments in the System Preferences.\n\nA: I have figured out the solution but I am not sure how it works...there is a bug with macOS itself but we are supposed to disable and enable AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link) Every 10 minutes\nI have written a simple applescript export it to application while checking \"Stay open after run handler\" option...then put the application in the dock and open it everytime you switch on your computer...\nHere's the script\non run {}\n    idle {}\nend run\n\non open {}\n    idle {}\nend open\n\non idle {}\n    \n    set shellCommand to do shell script \"echo yourmacpasswordgoeshere | sudo -S ifconfig awdl0 down\"\n    set shellCommand to do shell script \"echo yourmacpasswordgoeshere | sudo -S ifconfig awdl0 up\"\n    return 600\nend idle\n\non quit {}\n    set quitApplication to display dialog \"Are you sure you want to quit the application googoogoo ?\" buttons {\"No\", \"Yes\"} default button \"Yes\"\n    if button returned of quitApplication is \"Yes\" then\n        continue quit\n    end if\nend quit\n\nI have made a simple shortcut\nhttps://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51c894aa8870401698a1b4414d234bcb\n", "Q: Is it possible to remap the enter key on a iPad Smart Keyboard?

I would like to turn off the Pinned Tabs feature in Safari on Mac (11.6.3). I thought I would like the feature, but I don't - not only does it not behave like other browsers (purposeful design decision I realize), but tabs are persisted, even after I pin different tabs and/or restart the browser (probably a bug, but a frustrating one). I suspect that the latter issue can be fixed by clearing the cache and cookies, but just want to confirm the fact that nothing else an be done.\n\nA: You can unpin a tab by right clicking it and choosing the option to unpin it.\nYou cannot disable the feature. However, if you don't pin tabs then it won't interfere with your browsing otherwise.\n\nA: One thing that you might consider worth looking into is to check if you have iCloud sync enabled for Safari data. A few months back, I got an issue in which Safari tabs from previous sessions kept reopening, others keep loading-back, and that kind of stuff. It was all due to an iCloud sync setting.\n", "Q: Move iPhone Backup Folder to external hard drive, and later back to my laptop?

Is it enough to simply cut and past the some-string folder and that's it?

I actually saw that and could have sworn I fixed it, but apparently not.\nNew problem: macOS now replaces the filenames you actually need to know with \"\" in the log output. What can I do about that? Or is there a better way to go about this entirely?\n\nA: The problems seems to be that you have written the command slightly incorrectly - it needs to be typed in exactly as per the link you have. I.e. instead of a single \"-\" you need to have double \"--\" for the shorten argument.\nThe correct command is here:\nbrctl log -w --shorten\n\nPerhaps use copy and paste to ensure it is the correct command, you're running.\nThe command above works also on the latest macOS versions.\nNote that in order to view file names that are redacted as <private>, you need to install a profile allowing you to do so. You can read how to do that in my answer here:\nMacOS alternative to USBLogView for Windows\n", "Q: 20W Apple Charging Brick — still safe to use after *mishap*? While removing my charging brick from the power outlet, a metal button slipped from my hand and went between the adapter (not fully removed) and the power socket—which was switched on at that time—resulting in a reasonably terrifying spark and my new 20W Apple Power adapter looking like this:\n\nI know it's probably hard, if not impossible, to ascertain whether the brick is still safe to use, but I want to ask nevertheless: should I still use this to charge my iPhone 12, or trouble my dad to buy me a new one?\nPS: The black powdery stuff appears to be from the button\n\nUPDATE:\nI examined the adapter a bit closer and there seems to be a circular patch of metal exposed on both arms which is complementary to the ones I see on the button.\n\n\nA: Those scorch marks are enough to possibly damage the internals. I would seek repair from Apple. They will often cover the cost of repair to analyze the part and ensure you have a safe charging experience.\nUsing that could be a fire hazard. If you can afford a new one, buy immediately. If you can not afford a replacement, even more important that you don’t use this and risk a fire at home or school or work with a limited budget. Charge your phone from any other source until someone trained to evaluate the part can advise you.\nExcellent photos and I’m so happy you didn’t have worse results from that AC arc and short circuit experience.\n", "Q: How does file access time updating work on macOS? I have a volume on my 12.3.1 M1 Macbook Pro, /System/Volumes/Data, which has attributes apfs, local, journaled, nobrowse, protect but not noatime. I would assume, then, that any access of a file in this volume will update the file's access time (which I get with stat -f '%Sa' /path/to/file). However, when I run cat /path/to/file, I don't see it being updated, nor when I do a simple open/read/close in C. What's going on here?\n\nA: APFS has slightly different default semantics on access timestamps than you might expect. In particular, by default the access timestamp of a file is only updated on read if the currently stored access timestamp is prior to the file's modification timestamp.\nYou can change that to get the traditional behavior by setting the feature flag APFS_FEATURE_STRICTATIME on the volume. This is not something an ordinary user should have to do, so I would recommend against going for that option unless you have very specific requirements.\n\nA: Noticing that the implied second question wasn't answered (as in: how to get atime updated), and leveraging off @jksoegaard's comment, I'll ask:\nHow do we set APFS_FEATURE_STRICTATIME for a particular APFS volume?\n(Note: if it matters, apfs.util does not exist on Mojave, although the man page for it does.)\nFor me, the files I want to see access time on are under /Library and /Applications, and /usr\nAccording to 'mount', the only fs with 'noatime' is /System/Volumes/VM, all the rest lack the noatime bit.\nthanks!\n", "Q: School Traces Leftover Apple friends.\nI was provided an education MacBook Air a while ago. It's was a rent, however I have paid it off now and am almost leaving school thankfully.\nBecause of this, I have been meddling around with settings and files inside it and have found an abundance of education-created restrictions such as monitoring applications and configuration profiles. I have been trying to clear a lot of these, but am having some troubles. So I have a few questions to ask. For reference, this is Monterey 12.4.\n\n*\n\n*I am an administrator or, at the very least, have administrator permissions. However there are different files (primarily system ones) that I am unable to delete. Like the \"move to bin\" option isn't present at all. I've tried running the sudo and rm commands in terminal to delete them, but it tells me the operation isn't permitted (despite being admin). Logging in as the system/root user doesn't change this either. Even as the highest permission (root), it doesn't let me delete or change any important system files. There are no other users other than myself, a spare I created and the root. I can't boot into any modes (recovery, safe etc) to delete them either [see 2] What can I do here?\n\n*There is a built-in firmware lock and I don't have the password to it. Yipee!! Because of this, I can't boot into any modes such as recovery or safe to delete or change certain files. I have tried to delete it using the terminal (sudo firmwarepasswd -delete), but it said password incorrect despite using my correct admin and login password. This was the same result with sudo firmwarepasswd -verify. I tried to set a new firmware password instead (sudo firmwarepasswd -setpasswd) and I actually got more results. It asked for my password. I entered it, it allowed it. Then it told me to enter a new firmware password, which I did. Then it asked to re-enter password, and that's where the issue continued. I did everything right, entered the exact same password, yet it gave me \"ERROR | setPasswdFromCommandLine | Unable to verify password ERROR | main | Exiting with error: 4\"\nTrying this in root didn't work either.\nI'm seriously stumped. What can I even do now?\n\nThank you.\n\nA: The two things to check are:\n\n*\n\n*Ask the school to verify that Apple School Manager / Apple Business Manager can remove device enrollment profile. Better to get a proof of sale receipt as well from them\n\n*Ask them to release the Mac from MDM and provide / release the firmware password.\n\nThe first helps when you need to erase things and the second will avoid you running into a policy where Apple will only unlock a device for the original purchaser.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455\nOnce these are completed, you will want to perform an erase install to validate you have complete control of your property.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/erase-and-reinstall-macos-mh27903/mac\n", "Q: QuickLook can't see Olympus \".ORF\" raw image files? On my laptop (MacBook Pro 9,2) I can preview Olympus \".ORF\" files by pressing the space bar, and they all have proper image icons.\nON my desktop (Mac Pro 5,1) all \".ORF files\" have generic icons, and pressing the space bar does not display the image — just a larger version of the generic icon.\nAnyone know the proper \".qlgenerator\" file I need to move from my laptop to my desktop to get \".ORF\" files to be viewable without opening an application?\nBoth machines are running MacOS Catalina 10.15.7.\nI also searched each computer for \".qlgenerator\" files, which are the drivers for doing QuickLook on various file types. My desktop has some 60 of them, but the laptop only has ONE!\nSo, how do I go about viewing Olympus \".ORF\" raw file previews and icons on my desktop computer?\n\nA: In researching this problem, I discovered the command line utility qlmanage, with a rather simplistic and obtuse man page. Still, doing qlmanage -m gave me a list of some 460 registrants for QuickLook services!\nSo, I downloaded the excellent open source editor TextMate, and used the \"Text —> Filter Through Command… ⌘I\" menu item, and entered qlmanage -m | sort, and instantly had an editable list of all ~460 QuickLook services.\nI then pressed \"⌘F\" and entered \"raw\", then \"⌘]\" to right-indent the line, then \"⌘G\" to find the next instance of \"raw\", and repeated the \"indent, find next\" keystrokes to the end of the file. That narrowed it down to fifteen suspects.\nSurprise! Nearly all of them used \"/Library/QuickLook/SneakPeek Photo.qlgenerator\" as their QuickLook driver! I guess I must have installed it at some point…\nBut I must have had some reason for installing it, and I didn't want to lose whatever it was doing for me; I just didn't want it to do its thing to Olympus \".ORF\" files, because a \"naked\" MacOS Catalina apparently handles those files just fine.\nSo I thought I'd poke around further. The driver is actually a \"bundle,\" a directory containing executable code, resources, and an \"Info.plist\" file that generally holds configuration info, including what sorts of files the bundle operates on.\nLooking in \"Info.plist\", I found this line:\n<string>com.olympus.raw-image</string>\n\nI commented it out, using the XML comment prefix/postfix:\n<!--\n<string>com.olympus.raw-image</string>\n-->\n\nI then went to the terminal, and reset the QuickLook process, using qlmanage -r.\nI then went to the Finder, and selected a \".ORF\" file. There was a notable delay of a second or two, and then (be still, my heart!) the icon turned into a miniature version of the image! I pressed the space bar, and the raw image file showed the proper preview, instead of the generic image icon!\nAs it turns out, my reticence to simply nuke the entire \"SneekPeak Photo.qlgenerator\" was unfounded. Only after going through the above to selectively disable it for Olympus RAW files, did I try to find it on the web. It used to do neat things for image previews, including showing some image EXIF data and a histogram. The company no longer supports it. Too bad; it was pretty neat! Someone should do something like this!\nSo, the best thing to do is to simply delete /Library/QuickLook/SneakPeek Photo.qlgenerator and execute qlmanage -r, which may improve system stability, since it's thirteen-year-old software, and apparently doesn't do anything useful any more.\nI hope this saves someone a bunch of trouble!\n", "Q: Can the iPhone reliably detect fake batteries or are there ways around it?

Recently after updating an app (Watchman's watchman, using Homebrew) is behaving like it no longer has access to Files & Folders, despite the fact that I have given it access in Security settings. In fact, I have several (old?) instances that I've given access:\n\nIs there a reason that an app would behave this way? I'd originally thought it might be an issue with the app itself, but have not seen reports that this is the case, and am now thinking something may be wrong with how I've set up Privacy for the app?\nAre there other settings that might be affecting an app's access to Files & Folders? I know I can give the app Full Disk Access, which would also cover Files & Folders, but doing that does not fix the issue.\nOr is the issue perhaps something to do with my Files & Folders settings in general? There a few things that make me wonder:\n\n*\n\n*Multiple entries for the same item, all of which seem to indicate uninstalled versions of the item.\n\n*Unresponsiveness of the UI. For several (though not all) items I have to click many times and wait before a click has any effect.\n\n*Inability to manually add or remove items. I see the +/- control at the bottom but it's never enabled (as it is for Full Disk Access). Is it supposed to be?\n\nIs this how the Files & Folders settings UI is supposed to work?\n\nA: No - a well behaved app should remain with the same identity and not fork things. If this is the only app, you might have luck removing it.\nIf other apps are forking permissions, a more general reset might be in order if you can't sort out why the items repeat.\n\n*\n\n*https://gist.github.com/haircut/aeb22c853b0ae4b483a76320ccc8c8e9\nWhen you reset everything in the database with tccutil, it bulk removes all entries for that app or class.\n\nReset all decisions for the specified service, causing apps to prompt again the next time they access the service.

The permissions seem to be correct. The shared folder is located on the macOS machine / it owns the shared folder.\n\nI have a shared folder on macOS Catalina (It's just the default Public folder) that can be accessed by an Ubuntu machine. The share is set up using SMB.\nIf the Linux machine copies over a photo, text file, whatever into the shared folder, the macOS machine cannot open it. I get a permissions error. If the macOS machine does the same, the Linux machine has no problems whatsoever.\nI have tried many settings on macOS to no avail including \"Apply to enclosed items\".\nHere's a screenshot of all the sharing settings on macOS so you can see what I have done.\n\nThe first screenshot shows the error when the admin account on macOS tries to open any file that was transferred from the Linux machine. The account has read/write permissions to the shared folder. Even if I copy a file to the macOS desktop, the error persists.\nThe second screenshot shows Sharing settings in System Preferences. The blacked out parts are just the folder name and the two users who have access to said folder. One user is the macOS admin account, the other user is login credentials for the Linux machine.\nThe third screenshot is details of the shared folder by right clicking > Get Info.\n\n*\n\n*macOS Catalina is the machine sharing the folder\n\n*Ubuntu 20.0.4 can see the shared folder and use it without issue\n\n*The machines are connected on a local network\n\n*The Linux machine has it's own login credentials to the shared folder that were set up on the mac. It is not using a \"guest\" account.\n\n\nA: I suspect you have one or more extended attributes set.\nThese are arbitrary strings or binary metadata about a file. A file can have any number of these, and there are not really any standards for them, except within OS vendors. Thus, Linux can have it's own set, and MacOS can have its own set, explaining the behaviour you observe.\nIf you want to learn more about these, here is a good resource.\nBut if you just want to get rid of them, you're going to have to use Terminal commands.\nYou can try ls -la@ * in your directory to see if any of your files (or more importantly, the directory they live in) have any extended attributes.\nIf you see something suspicious in the list, you can use xattr -d com.apple.AttributeName * to remove all the extended attributes with the name com.apple.AttributeName — substituting what you think is suspicious for \"AttributeName\", of course.\nYou may see a number of com.apple.FinderInfo attributes. They are probably not the problem. That's where the Finder stores things like file tags.\nIf you report back here what ls -la@ shows you, perhaps we can figure out if this is the problem, and if so, which attributes you should nuke to get rid of it.\n\nA: In this situation, when the file is transferred, the owner of the file by default is the user which performed the transfer. In this case, this is not the user who owns the shared folder. Also, the basic attributes were not transferred. Instead, the mode bits were set to 0060, which only gives read/write permission to the file owner. In the OP's question, the user who tried opening the file is not the owner of the file. Therefore, permission was denied and the popup message shown the OP's question was presented.\n\nI should point out that according to this post, the owner of the file or folder can be determined from the corresponding Finder info window. Under Sharing & Permissions, the owner is the last user shown in the Name column. Note also that the root user will have the name of system.\nFor example, the image below shows two users: davidanderson and ronjanzen. Since ronjanzen is the last user shown, ronjanzen is the owner of the folder RonShare.\n\n", "Q: python shell becomes unusable after suspend (ctrl-Z) and 'fg' command When I suspend python with ctrl+Z and try to get it back with fg, I cannot use the python interactive command prompt anymore.

Name them as part 1, 2, & 3 if you don't need to combine them. On the other hand, I recommend LosslessCut to join them back together on a computer very quickly and simply.\n", "Q: Does macOS store the tags of Finder separately from the tagged files? I just recovered data from a thumbdrive using Disk Drill following What to do when mounting APFS from thumbdrive suddenly shows error and Disk Utility First Aid unable to fix\nBut now all the Finder tags on all the recovered files are missing.\nI tagged those files in the thumbdrive using my Macbook A1990 on a macOS 10.13.6. Does the OS store the tags separately (eg. in an SQLite database) so I can recover those tags? If yes, where may I find them? (If no, is there any other way to recover those tags, with Disk Drill, or otherwise?)\n\nA: The tags are in metadata associated with each original file - this even works across to a Windows shared folder structure, though Windows itself cannot see them.\nIf you're scavenging to rescue from a failed drive [especially if it's not HFS+], then you're lucky if you get the right file names, forget the metadata.\nFrom your linked question, I wouldn't use APFS on a USB stick/SD card either. Stick to HFS+.\n", "Q: Unnecessary locations for Spotlight indexing? I've noticed Spotlight using a lot of processor time and when I review where it's digging about via sudo fs_usage mdworker mds, I see that most of the time is being spent in /System/Library/ and /Library/ as well as some other places like /opt/ for Homebrew and MacPorts.\nI'm curious, has anyone compiled a safe list of paths/folders to exclude from indexing by Spotlight so as to reduce Spotlights indexing load and database size?\n\nA: I haven't found anything yet, but this script might prove useful to exclude, for example, all node_modules, all .git, all Caches, etc.: https://alexwlchan.net/2021/08/ignore-lots-of-folders-in-spotlight/\n", "Q: Accidental Presses With Smart Keyboard Folio I plan to buy the iPad Air with the Smart Keyboard Folio and Apple Pencil soon.

Thanks!\n\nA: I am not sure if this is what you mean by \"Apple enterprise account\" but there is the Apple Developer Enterprise Program:\n\nThe Apple Developer Enterprise Program allows large organizations to develop and deploy proprietary, internal-use apps to their employees. This program is for specific use cases that require private distribution directly to employees using secure internal systems or through a Mobile Device Management solution.\n\nIt's possible to develop and sign apps with this program, distribute them on an internal website and send a link to that website to your employees. They have to accept your organization as a trusted developer, but otherwise you don't have to manage Apple IDs or something like that.\n", "Q: How do you add contacts to iCloud on iPhone?

I recently had some trouble with System data growing large, up to 150 Gb, for unclear reasons on macOS  Monterey, macOS 12.0 Beta.\nYesterday I found out that it was due to time machine snapshots. I ran tmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 1000000000, which reduced system data to 30 Gb. This morning, however, I saw that system data had again increased to 85 Gb. The tmutil command doesn't seem to work now. I did disable automatic backups in the Time Machine preferences.\nHere is the output of diskutil list internal, and some additional screen shots:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         250.8 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +250.8 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD - Data     132.2 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 925.4 MB   disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                1.1 GB     disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      2.1 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            31.0 GB    disk1s5\n   6:              APFS Snapshot com.apple.os.update-... 31.0 GB    disk1s5s1\n\n\nAlso, I'm curious if the containers and volumes hierarchy shown on the left of the Disk Utility screenshot looks normal.\n\n\nDoes anyone know how to reclaim this space, or how to find out what it contains?\n\nA: You don't really need to reclaim the space. Time Machine will clear it itself, as part of every 'real' backup task. There’s a check to pre clean and post destination as well as clean up the source.\nTo see these snapshots, open disk utility and select the view menu item named Show APFS Snapshots (command - shift - s)\n\nFrom there you can see the private size of each snapshot and remove them if needed.\nYou cannot [as far as i'm aware] disable these internal backups. Disabling the main backup will not affect it, and may cause it to use even more space as it's waiting longer to be able to do a full backup.\nIf you delete it manually, it will simply refill again. If you need the space for something else, then Time Machine will just, in effect, move out of your way and use less & less - though by the time you are really fighting it for space, your drive is too full. You should always leave 10-15%. Right now, you have plenty of space, so there's no conflict.\n", "Q: How can I use my Google Account with Apple apps (Mail, Calendar, etc) in OS X 10.10 and older? For months, Google has been warning me that I \"may lose access to apps that are using less secure sign-in technology\".\n\nThe warnings directed to this page with more information. Starting on May 30, Google was planning to prevent software which does not use the modern OAuth2 authentication scheme from logging into any Google account. Unfortunately, this includes Apple applications built into OS X 10.10 and older, such as Mail, Contacts, and Calendar. (This applies even to accounts added via \"Sign in with Google\", and even though \"less secure app access\" was not previously required.)\nI am using OS X 10.9 Mavericks. As was foretold, on the morning of June 1, 2022 at around 7 am EDT, the Mail, Calendar, and Notes apps spontaneously became unable to connect to my Google account.\nHow can I use my Google account without updating to an ugly flat version of OS X?\n\nA: Google still offers a workaround for applications that don't use OAuth2, but they don't publicize it. You need to create an \"app password\", and use that to sign in instead of your normal password.\nFirst, go to https://myaccount.google.com/security and turn on \"2-Step Verification\". Follow the instructions to add a verification method for your Google Account. Unfortunately, there is no way to avoid this.\nAfterwards, go back to https://myaccount.google.com/security and select the newly-available \"app passwords\" option. Use the options provided to generate a new app password.\nFinally, remove your Google Account from System Preferences, then add it back again using your newly-generated app password in place of your normal password. (I recommend completely removing and re-adding the account like this to avoid potential problems with sending messages in Apple Mail.)\nAfterwards, you will once again be able to use Mail, Contacts, Notes, Reminders, and Calendar/iCal with your Google Account.\n\nIf Google ever removes the app password feature (I don't think they will, lest they cut off every plain IMAP email client), consider trying\nYo'av Moshe's OAuth Hopper instead, which should also work.\n", "Q: Catalina equivalent to systemctl status?

Prepending sudo will also display system launchdaemons.\nThe unix command grep can be used to filter the output of stdin.

At least that was the case for me on iOS.\nHow can I now extract the TOTP secret of that code (a value in the format like DKFUOLOFUJTDWKIEIS2LZRWGUFZOOAW9), so it could be stored in other password managers, such as KeePassXC, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.?\nI can also see the code in the Passwords tab in Safari on Mac OS, so at least it is synced there, and my iPhone isn't the only place where I have it:\n\nAnd theoretically it should be easier to perform the extraction on Mac OS, as, unlike iOS, there is a proper access to the filesystem.\nIs there a mechanism to get these secrets back out (iOS or Mac OS or web) as plain text after ingesting them to the iCloud Keychain?\n\nA: Oh well, just before submitting the question, I remembered that Safari supports exporting passwords to a plain-text CSV file. So I did File → Export → Passwords..., and the TOTP secret was present in the resulting Passwords.csv:\nwww.instagram.com (USERNAME),https://www.instagram.com/,USERNAME,PASSWORD,,otpauth://totp/Instagram:USERNAME?secret=DKFUOLOFUJTDWKIEIS2LZRWGUFZOOAW9&issuer=Instagram\n\nAnd I've successfully added it to another password manager.\n", "Q: ICloud shows 3Gb messages, but top conversations shows 0kb I can’t back up my iPhone.

How do I reclaim my space?\n\nA: Did you try going to Settings -> General -> iPhone Storage?

However when I try to upgrade formulas using brew upgrade or brew upgrade --cask it tries to upgrade MacTeX also, which I do not want. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: MacTeX is installed as a Homebrew cask, casks can't be pinned though (see https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/49127#issuecomment-401501245 and https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/90242)\n\nA huge chunk of casks auto-update and we can’t stop that. So pin would at best be inconsistent and not work in a lot of cases.\n\nThere is a user-written extension called homebrew-cask-upgrade which seems to address this issue, but I have no experience with it and it may bring along other issues.\nFor your specific scenario, I would just install MacTeX directly from TUG and avoid any auto-updating triggered by Homebrew. Or, if you don't need the GUI applications bundled with MacTeX, use brew install texlive which just installs the non-GUI binaries and can be pinned.\n\nA: I posted another workaround.\nYou can simply remove the cask file.

(connecting to Linux server outside Terminal) This feels so trivial but I've learned a Linux system I've used remotely for years may be shutting down and I'm anxious to move all of my files off of it.  I've connected to it by opening a MacOS connection (Go -> Connect to Server) but I have long forgotten the correct prefix to the URL so I've been using ftp:// of late.  However, this option does not show any hidden files (prefixed with a \".\"), and a link to my web directory is also not visible.  Any assistance in either connecting properly or seeing these additional files/directories would be appreciated.\n\nA: In Finder you can press Shift+CMD+. to toggle hidden folders/files. Often their name is prefixed with a ..\nIf that doesn't show any additional folders, best would be to use a command line tool, such as rsync, to get all the files from your remote Linux machine onto your Mac.\n", "Q: How to make a dock icon for a specific Terminal profile? I'm running Big Sur 11.6.6\nI have a number of Terminal profiles. I know how to select any of these different profiles after I have started Terminal, but I'm wondering if there is any way to set up icons in the dock, each of which will open Terminal using a different one of its profiles.\nI'm guessing that I possibly could somehow manage this via Automator, but I'm hoping that there might be a more straightforward way of accomplishing this, so that I can avoid Automator altogether.\nCan I script startup as a document file so I can have shortcuts in my dock?\n\nA: Oh! I figured out the answer to my question.\nAll I have to do is start Terminal, go to Preferences=>Profiles, click on any given profile, and then click on the button at the bottom of the list of profiles which has a circle with three horizontal dots in it. In the drop-down that comes up, I can select Export... and the profile can then be saved as [ProfileName].terminal.\nThen, I just need to go into Finder and drag that [ProfileName].terminal file onto the dock.\n", "Q: Need to clear space to update MacOS can I delete files from /private/var/tnp? I need to clear up space for my Mac to get a software update but I need so much space. I have the macOS Monterey installer which already takes up 12 gb and I'm seeing to see if I can clear up space from this  and this is saying how much space I need for the download   should I just maybe factory reset my computer I don't really have anything important on my computer but I want to get Xcode for programming but I need the software update. thanks.\n\nA: I would boot to Safe Boot mode (holding down shift at restart). Then restart normally. This will clear out temporary files and caches, making more space.\nHowever, the majority of stuff is likely to be User files. You may need to off-load some of your user data to another disk.\nBear in mind that Xcode is over 12 Gb, and once you start programming stuff, project files are going to start taking up space. You may need to work from an external.\n\nA: Seeing as you have skipped Big Sur it is always worth checking to see if a previous software update is lurking in your applications folder taking up space. I would assume Disk Drill should be showing that, but I cannot see any applications in your screenshot and there is still 61GB of used space yet to be accounted for on your scan.\nSometimes this is because certain directories are hidden unless an app like DiskDrill is granted full disk access and administrator authentication. For help enabling full disk access see here:\nhttps://www.cleverfiles.com/help/full-disk-access-disk-drill-catalina.html\n@benwiggy 's suggestion to attempt to start in safe boot is an excellent one as this often automatically clears any bloated cache directories and reclaims what is known as 'purgeable space, which you may have a considerable amount of if you've already deleted lots of things and are yet to restart.\nBeyond that as others have mentioned, private/var/tnp is not a valid directory, it should be tmp. This may be preventing the system from automatically clearing that directory. Navigate to it in finder from Go in the menu bar > Go to Folder then enter /private/var/tnp and report back what you find. For reference, mine is currently 6KB. Whatever you find and decide to do, you should rename this folder back to tmp though.\nEven if you can safely delete it however, you still have another 61GB of used space to explore. Perhaps up to 20GB maximum will be the system and if you are planning to download Xcode, you still need to clear up some more space on your 128GB drive in order for you to make the most of it.\n\nIf the above seems like a little too much work, and you have your important documents backed up, a complete erase and reinstall - albeit a little extreme yes - isn't the worst idea.\nIf you decide to go down that route you can use internet recovery using Option-Command-R at startup, which should take you straight to the Monterey recovery installer.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204904\nOf course if you decide to do that and get stuck with the reinstall, you can chat to Apple Support over the phone or book an appointment in store and they can reinstall the OS for you over their wired network very quickly indeed!\nLet us know how you get on :)\n", "Q: How to change option after hitting Cmd+Q with just the keyboard?

With age, I am losing the memory to check my calendar every day and therefore just forget some issues.  I have searched all the major search engines with the following question and find nothing.  When I reopen the desktop from sleep mode, is there a way to force the calendar to open with it so I can check and recheck what is going on in my life?  It seemed to be a simple idea, and notifications are on, but there seems to be no means of activating the calendar to open from sleep.  The computer is never turned off so that is not an issue.  I just want the calendar to appear whenever it awakes from sleep no matter how many times in a day.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You could write a small script that 1) invokes sleep, and then 2) opens Calendar.\nBut this would only happen if you ran the script manually, not if the machine spontaneously decided to sleep.\n\nA: Here is something else to try to help you to remember to use Calendar.\nI have installed Mini Calendar. This is on the menu bar, and so it is simple to access. It looks like a tiny calendar, and when you click on it, it shows you the current month.\n\nThat does not show you your appointments, but if you then double-click on any date there, it will open the \"real\" Calendar for you, where all your appointments and such are stored!\nIt has a preference you can set to always display a translucent mini-calendar on top of everything, but I find that annoying. I don't think it would help you, because it is not clickable to bring up the Calendar app.\nMini Calendar is free. Clicking the link above should take you to the App Store, where you can download and install it.\nIf this doesn't suit you, I found a list of other menu-bar calendar applications. Something in that list might suit you better.\nIn particular, there's one on that list that will show your next appointment right on the menu bar! It is also free.\n\nHaving a menu-bar calendar might not be what you wanted, but it might be enough to remind you to do a couple clicks to open your Calendar!\n", "Q: What does sips --man option do sips, or “scriptable image processing system” is a command-line tool shipping by default with macOS which allows basic image manipulation (think ImageMagick but not as powerful).\nI found something odd on it’s man page:\n --man\n       Generate man pages\n\nIt’s not clear at all why this tool would benefit from a way to generate man pages, nor how the feature works. What does it do and how does one use it?\n\nA: I'm not sure why Apple is distributing the manual inside the application. The syntax --man is familiar to users of the Korn shell. It will produce static manuals for certain korn shell builtin commands. To use --man with sips you could uses the following:\nsips --man | /usr/bin/groff -Tutf8 -mandoc -c \n\nthat will produce a static manpage.\n\nA: Try it!\nAs the man page says: it generates a man page. man pages have a specific format with various text codes to style the data.\nIt generates a copy of the sips man page.\n", "Q: Keep iMessage Phone Number with new SIM Card I recently went to Mexico and I purchased a SIM card for my trip as it was much cheaper than paying the international rates.

Is there a way to keep my number associated with my iCloud account while I have a different SIM card in?\nI have a cellular enabled iPad that I no longer have service for--would putting my SIM card in my iPad accomplish this?\n\nA: Putting it in your iPad probably wouldn't accomplish it, as your iPad doesn't support phone lines and wouldn't feed it into iMessage.\nIf your phone and one of the two lines (main and travel) supports eSIM you could use that to have a dual sim:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209044\nFor example, if you use AT&T you should be able to convert the physical SIM to an eSIM directly from the Cellular page in Settings.

I am trying to stop sound played on the laptop to be captured by my microphone but I cannot figure a way out.\nI am running on macOS Monterey.\nThe audio I have played on the laptop could be heard, I checked this with my friend during a call today using the laptop. Is there is a way to stop this?\n\nA: macOS expects you to manage sound output with mute or other volume controls so you can use the speakers to hear the call and keep playing music or other alerts (maybe a second call will come in while you’re on the first).\nRather than automating a ducking or pause, you might want to consider using a pair of headphones with an attached boom microphone connected to your computer. The model I've linked to we've used for Advance Placement Language testing in my school and they are comfortable and work perfectly. The mic picks up only your voice when positioned correctly, and the ear cups shield most ambient sound. They work with any 4-conductor headphone/mic input, and we have used these successfully on Macs, iPads, Windows laptops and ChromeBooks. There are many other models available.\n\n\nA: What you're asking is (technically) \"impossible\" although there are a few workarounds.\nThe problem is that you're asking for the microphone to selectively avoid doing its job. If there's noise going into the microphone, it WILL get picked up. That is the whole purpose of a microphone.\nMany modern call and conferencing programs attempt to do \"ambient noise reduction\" through a variety of algorithms. Mac OS comes with something similar built in. However, none of these are foolproof. The algorithm makes its \"best guess\" to determine what you want to speak, and what is ambient noise. Other algorithms may attempt to read the computer's current audio output and \"correct\" for it.\nThe only foolproof way to solve your problem is to PREVENT the microphone from \"hearing\" your speakers.\nYou could listen to audio over headphones. Or you could use \"push to talk\" (mute the microphone except when you push to speak).\n", "Q: Stop facetime video pausing when switching spaces When I facetime call from my macbook (macOS Mojave) how can I stop the facetime video from turning off when I switch spaces (especially to full-screened apps, especially Safari)?\n\nA: The only workaround I have found for this is to assign FaceTime to All Desktops.  In the Dock, right-click on the FaceTime app icon and under Options, assign it to All Desktops.  This really shouldn't be necessary and Apple should fix this in FaceTime.  It does appear that the desktop assignment persists even after quitting FaceTime, so that helps.\nEDIT: You must have multiple spaces already created for the All Desktops option to be available.\n", "Q: iterm2 split pane - type simultaneously in both split windows I am using iterm2.

I had a tagged vlan to access my NAS. It worked very well last time I checked. I don't remember when I actually checked it last time, but at least everything - time machine, shared mounts, etc - seemed to be working fine) until I replaced it with a Mac Studio in april.\nThen I realized something weird: traffic between Mac Studio and other macs on my network - 10Gbps or not - flows very well on tagged vlans. However, traffic between my Mac Studio and my NAS (and then between my Mac Studio and other Linux machines) goes only one way - Mac -> Linux, when using a tagged vlan. I get no traffic from the linux machines back to the mac. Linux <--> Linux works well, Mac <--> Mac works well.\nI thought initially this was a Mac Studio issue. So I tested with a MacBook Pro M1. Same problem. I thought, oh well, this might be an M1 issue. I borrowed a MacBook Pro 2018, and again, same issue.\nI used iperf3 for testing. I changed the switches - my network has mostly Ubiquiti switches, but I also have a small Mikrotik, and I tested with it. I even tested traffic between a mac and a Linux VM on ESXi running on a Mac Mini 2014. Still the same issue: traffic goes only one way between macOS and non-macOS. I also tried different Linux distros (Fedora, Ubuntu, TrueNAS Scale).\nI am inclined to believe this is a Monterey issue, but my previous Mac Mini did have Monterey (although it was still one of the first versions).\nThe only thing I haven't tested is traffic to a linux machine that is not on a VM. All my tests were between a mac and a Linux hosted on a VM under ESXi. But still, traffic between Linux on different hosts/machines/esxi-nodes worked fine.\nTraffic that goes on untagged vlan flows normally.\nAny clue on how to debug this properly to get the culprit?\nEDIT: just to clarify, I don't believe it is an MTU issue. I had jumbo frames enabled all the way (the Mac Studio had absolutely the same configuration as my previous Mac Mini, which had its MTU adjusted to 9000). And, as said, it does work between two macs and to Linux machines. I also tried with the standard MTU (1500), adjusting it all along the way, and same behavior.\nEDIT #2: I manage to test traffic between the Mac and a Linux (Fedora) on bare metal, again, on tagged vlan. It worked. So maybe ESXi is the problem.\n\nA: According to your own comments, the problem is really not that the traffic-flow is one-way only. Rather you problem is that large transfers fail.\nUsually this is because you have the wrong MTU setting. For a 10 Gbps ethernet link, your NAS is probably setup for jumbo frames.\nYou'll want to disable that on the NAS, or enable jumbo frames on your Mac. You can do that from System Preferences > Network, click Advanced for your network interface and under the Hardware tab set MTU to for example Jumbo (9000).\n", "Q: Safari keeps losing cookies For like two weeks now I'm facing a strange issue with Safari (Version 15.5 (17613.2.7.1.8)) on macOS (Monterey), which keeps \"forgetting\" all cookies, including log-in ones.\nThat is extremely annoying because it happens really often - maybe every hour? And with most sites nowadays you have to enter 2FA as well so if you're logged in to multiple sites you're working with for the whole day, I bet I'd have to spend at least an hour every day re-logging to every single one. I've been using Safari almost exclusively for years now and have all credentials stored in Keychain so switching to a different browser is an almost impossible task (I know I can have a look into Keychain for passwords but I'd prefer not to look into it multiple times a day).\nI'm not aware of any changes to my system, other than uninstalling Java JDK 16.0.2 (I think that was the version...). The reason for uninstalling that was another weird issue - for some reason, whenever I clicked a button on any page, it \"clicked\" the back button and I got redirected back - this no longer happens after uninstalling Java. I definitely didn't install any browser extensions.\nAny thoughts what might be causing that and how to fix it?\n\nA: What is your cookie sameSite option? Is it strict?\nI'm using Safari 15.2. When I quit Safari and reopen it. The cookie is gone because of the strict sameSite, it happened with the back where you left feature. But when you select the URL and press Enter, the cookie appeared.\nMy guess is Safari cannot load Cookie with strict when it try to reload the previous session.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to make window fill up screen Is there a keyboard shortcut or a way of setting one to fill the window to the whole screen size, without actually being full screened.\nThere is a way by holding shift and clicking the green plus icon, but I'd prefer a keyboard shortcut for this.\n\nA: There's no shortcut key… & in fact Opt/Green dot doesn't always fill the entire screen; that depends on app & document type, sometimes it only fills vertically.\nThe way to guarantee it expands to the entire screen area is to Opt/double click any window corner [when the cursor turns to a double arrow].\n(I'm sure this question exists on here somewhere, but my google fu is failing me right now)\n\nA: You can change double click behavior on window title through System Preferences -> Dock & Menu Bar\nThis wouldn't solve your problem because you want a keyboard shortcut.

Is there any added security or tracking benefit to adding any of Apple's IP address features, such as \"Private Wi-Fi address\" or \"Limit IP Address Tracking\" or anything else?  Can you point me to a discussion of this? Thanks!\n\nA: Private Wi-Fi Address is not related to your VPN, it randomized the hardware identifiers the Wi-Fi router sees (MAC Address). You can keep this on.\nLimit IP Address Tracking is part of iCloud Private Relay. iCloud Private Relay disables when you have any VPN enabled.\n\nA: It has “always” been my understanding that a VPN (or even a pseudo-vpn, like a DNS configuration) will not work along side Apple’s Private Relay, so I usually rely on my other services (aka AdGuard) to protect me… and I have seen documentation to that end, but this is an “off the tips of my fingers” answer…\n", "Q: Notifications stopped working after iOS 15.5 update - possible bug?

The error codes for kCLErrorDomain can be seen in the CLError.h header file of the framework:\ntypedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, CLError) {\n    kCLErrorLocationUnknown  = 0,         // location is currently unknown, but CL will keep trying\n    kCLErrorDenied,                       // Access to location or ranging has been denied by the user\n    kCLErrorNetwork,                      // general, network-related error\n    kCLErrorHeadingFailure,               // heading could not be determined\n    kCLErrorRegionMonitoringDenied,       // Location region monitoring has been denied by the user\n    kCLErrorRegionMonitoringFailure,      // A registered region cannot be monitored\n    kCLErrorRegionMonitoringSetupDelayed, // CL could not immediately initialize region monitoring\n    kCLErrorRegionMonitoringResponseDelayed, // While events for this fence will be delivered, delivery will not occur immediately\n    kCLErrorGeocodeFoundNoResult,         // A geocode request yielded no result\n    kCLErrorGeocodeFoundPartialResult,    // A geocode request yielded a partial result\n    kCLErrorGeocodeCanceled,              // A geocode request was cancelled\n    kCLErrorDeferredFailed,               // Deferred mode failed\n    kCLErrorDeferredNotUpdatingLocation,  // Deferred mode failed because location updates disabled or paused\n    kCLErrorDeferredAccuracyTooLow,       // Deferred mode not supported for the requested accuracy\n    kCLErrorDeferredDistanceFiltered,     // Deferred mode does not support distance filters\n    kCLErrorDeferredCanceled,             // Deferred mode request canceled a previous request\n    kCLErrorRangingUnavailable,           // Ranging cannot be performed\n    kCLErrorRangingFailure,               // General ranging failure\n    kCLErrorPromptDeclined,               // Authorization request not presented to user\n};\n\nIf you're not familiar with the code above, it's fairly simple: kCLErrorLocationUnknown is assigned to 0 and the errors below that increment by 1. You're seeing an error code of 2, which maps to kCLErrorNetwork. The associated comment says that it's a \"general, network-related error\". While this is better than an unknown error it's sadly not specific enough to know the root cause.\nFrom your screenshot it looks like you have good wifi but it might be worth checking your network.\nBeyond that I'm not sure. I imagine that getting location info from the input probably extracts coordinates from the image's metadata and then uses the CLGecoder\ninterface to get the place name. The documentation for CLGeocoder suggests it might throttle the number of requests per minute (\"... in a typical situation, you should not send more than one geocoding request per minute\"). The other answer here from @F-erry bypasses this by building a URL for getting location from coordinates instead.\nBut in short, that error suggests a general network error. Check your network and try the shorcut on different networks and devices.\n\nA: I have a similar issue and on reddit I found another person with a similar issue and no solution.\nThe KCLErrorDomain error might be triggered by an Apple location API. At this point I'm guessing, but it's a conclusion I draw based on a question I saw on stackoverflow. Where somebody is writing Swift code and gets the KCLErrorDomain error. The answers for that particular question suggests a network error or API throttle.\nIn my Shortcut I can exclude network error or api throttling.\nThat leaves another cause with the location API still in place. So I experimented a bit more and noticed that the location information from a picture or video is different from other location information e.g. de location information you can get from the weather service.\nAs such this KCLErrorDomain might be a bug in Shortcuts because the location information cannot be correctly processed by the API and this is something only apple can fix.\nfor future reference: I'm currently on ios 15.6\nI found a workaround\nIt's not very fast, but it works.\nI could not make it work without the Get distance step although this step seems pointless for the desired result.\n\n", "Q: What does Airplane Mode do on a iPad without cellular functionality? What does Airplane Mode do on an iPad without cellular functionality? It doesn't seem to disable either BlueTooth or WiFi - when I press the Airplane Mode button on my iPad, both of those channels remain on and functional. Morever, I can't see any option to allow Airplane Mode to disable these channels. So what does it turn off?\n(Despite the similar titles, this is not a duplicate of What's the point of airplane mode on a wifi-only iPad?, because of changes in how the iPad function since that question was asked. That question is asking \"What unique functionality does Airplane Mode deliver that you can't do manually?\", and apparently applied to an earlier version of the iPad for which Airplane Mode did disable BlueTooth and WiFi. I'm asking literally what does the toggle actually do in modern versions.)\niPad v 15.4.1\n\nA: The very first time you use it, it turns off all radios except for Bluetooth.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204234\nHowever, since they are allowed on planes you can be in Airplane mode and turn bluetooth or WiFi back on.  It remembers that, and the next time you go into airplane mode it does not turn off the ones you turned on manually.\nSo on a non-cellular iPad, initially it would turn off the wifi and bluetooth radios.   You can manually turn them back on, and if you do, the next time Airplane mode won't turn off anything.\n", "Q: Can I have my Mac automatically connect to a network store on login? I would like my MacBook Pro to automatically connect to a particular network volume whenever possible.\nAre there ways to automate this?\n\nA: First, connect your network volume through finder (cmd+K).\nThen, in system preferences go to \"Users & Groups\" and click on the tab \"Login Items\". Here you can add volumes that will be mounted automatically after login. Just click the add button, navigate to the network volume and click add.\n", "Q: Why can't I find the icon files of the old OSX online (there are only Imitative ones)? Is it because it is an infringement to extract the system icons and upload them to the network? Or simply because we are lazy and no one to extract?\n\nA: Icons used in macOS are copyrighted by Apple and can‘t be published online.\nPS: I‘m sure there are sites out there which host them, but they might not show up easily in search engines.\n", "Q: how can I copy paths in the $PATH environment from bash to zsh? How can I copy all the the command paths from the bash environment $PATH variable to the zsh environment?\nI'm on macOS 11.6.1 (and about to install 11.6.6).\nMany of the commands I used in bash don't work in zsh (the new default for Apple's Command line shell for new accounts). How can I get started with fixing my path?\n\nA: The main thing is to run the old shell and then echo $PATH.\nbash\necho $PATH\nexit \n\nAt that point, you can copy that value and paste it in your zsh dot files as a comment and work on replicating the missing items.\nI don’t know a tool that converts the path or files, but here is a place for you to start your learning on z shell. You can keep using bash and take your time setting up zsh so I recommend tiny steps on small tasks like you identified. First fix the path, then fix the next item with a new question is my advice. You don’t need to redo all four years of setup in one leap.\n", "Q: Is there a method to control an iPhone from a macOS laptop through bluetooth or cable? I know there is a method to control an iPhone from a Mac if you connect both an iPhone and a Mac to the same WiFi network, as described here.\nFor my case, both devices need to reside in different WiFi networks. What I am looking for is a method to achieve the control with connecting the two machines using bluetooth or cable.\n\nA: You could just connect the two devices using Ethernet.\nPlug a standard Ethernet cable into your Mac (use an Ethernet dongle, if your Mac doesn't have an Ethernet port) - and then connect the other end of that cable into an Ethernet dongle that is plugged into your iPhone.\nWhen you have the network setup and running properly, Switch Control will work as well.\n", "Q: Remapped Ctrl+V jumps to to new line in some apps, Ctrl+A moves cursor to the start of line (text areas) I configured general \"Edit\" shortcuts like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+A, Ctrl+X, etc. shortcuts in \"Linux/Windows\" style trough System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App shortcuts > All Applications like so:\n\nI also swapped Mac's Fn -> Ctrl in \"Modifier keys\" and physical keys on keyboard.\nRunning on Monterey 12.1 MacBook Pro M1\n\nIn some applications like Notes, Pages, Terminal, Telegram, Intelij IDEA it works as expected. But in some apps like Slack, RDM, and Chrome in some cases it works weird.\nMost annoying is jumping to the end of the text area after pressing Ctrl+V somewhere inside the text while editing the text area. The first press of Ctrl+V jumps to the end of the text area, a second press of Ctrl+V will paste the text. Such behaviour repeats in Slack and Chrome text areas (in Chrome's address bar works fine).\nAnother annoying bug is sometimes Ctrl+A moves cursor to the start of the line instead of \"Select All\". Mostly repeats also in text areas of different apps (Slack, Chrome, Postman).\nLooks like Mac has it own shortcuts for Ctrl+V and Ctrl+A specifically for text areas. I want to learn how to find them and disable/reassign.\n\nA: I got the same problem and I think this answers your question and it worked for me. To be more specific, you need to mask ctrl +v by default.\n$ mkdir ~/Library/KeyBindings/\n$ vi ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict\n{\n   \"^v\" = \"noop:\";\n}\n\n", "Q: How to check if my device is owned on MDM? I previously registered my personal device with MDM, specifically Microsoft Intune (aka Company Portal) - it installed a bunch of software like Zscaler (and its root certificate) and a lot of Microsoft apps. I regretted it and I want to uninstall it.\nI followed the uninstall instructions at Remove device from Company Portal for macOS app and uninstalled the Company Portal App, removed Zscaler root certificate and Microsoft apps, and also that the Profiles section is gone from System Preferences.\nUnfortunately, whenever I restart the mac, I see a message below the lock screen: \"Welcome to CompanyName\". Without restarting, it doesn't show up on the normal lock screen, and I have confirmed that system preferences isn't configured with a lock screen message.\nWhat can I do to disable this message, or this persistent form of MDM.\n\nA: What you describe is typical and consistent with two things:\n\n*\n\n*MDM profiles loaded on your OS have been removed - profiles is where Apple lets you know the OS is currently managed and can be controlled.\n\n*All the changes the MDM made are not likely removed or reverted,  it some will be removed when the profile is deleted.\n\n*The machine may still be enrolled in automatic management by the company (which can force re-enrollment when it activates in the future) through Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager\nTo clean up after removing MDM, you want to follow the steps for your hardware and your macOS level to erase and reinstall a clean OS. Also confirm the company or school has released the device serial number from enrollment if you are taking ownership of the device from them.\n", "Q: Is there a way to script to mark Mails as read directly from the notification popup I get a lot of emails in a day, most of them I don't even need to read. I will the info I need just from the notification.\nIs there a way to script the clicking of \"mark as read\" from the notification pop up? That way I can then assign that script to a keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: I don't know about a shell script per se, but you could try scripting something in Automator that could run based upon an input of finding all mail messages marked as unread and then take an action on them. You may have to play around with it a bit, but it should be a solid solution.\n", "Q: How to show timestamp from iPhone voice memo I need the time stamp from my voice memo on my iPhone 7s to dispute a mv ticket. How can I gain access to this information?\nVoice memos only show the length of a recording but I also need the exact time of the recording.\nThanks!\n\nA: I did find a way to discover the date and time the voice memo was created, perhaps there are easier ways, but this works.\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone in the Voice Memos app select the recording you wish to find the date/time it was created.\n\n*Hit the three dots in the circle (...) on the top right.\n\n*Hit the Share button\n\n*E-mail the file to yourself\n\n*Open the e-mail on your PC\n\n*Download the voice recording file to your PC\n\n*Right-Click the file you downloaded and hit \"Properties\"\n\n*In the Properties menu at the top select the tab \"Details\"\n\n*Scroll down to the \"Origin\" section\n\n*You will see a label \"Media created\" and directly to the right of that the date and time the voice recording was created.\n\nThis process only helps you, however.

Now I've changed to a LG 32GN600-B 31.5\" 2k 165Hz screen due to me also gaming on it with my Windows machine and when running 2k the fonts look so atrociously blurry that it gives me a headache within minutes. What can I do about it?\n\nA: I only but recently learned about BetterDisplay. It actually solved all of my issues, though some limitations exists. Check it out!\n\nA: You may be able to access 'hi-dpi' resolutions either by holding Alt while clicking on \"Scaled\" in the Display System preference, or checking the \"Show all resolutions\" box.\n\nHowever, your 4K monitor at 28\" has a pixel density of 157 ppi, whereas a 2K monitor at 31.5\" has a pixel density of 93 ppi -- that's quite low, so slightly blurry text may be inevitable.\n\nA: I used this guide which helped. Run\ndefaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO\n\nto re-enable subpixel antialiasing.\n\nA: if anyone come across this install easyres\nand enable font smoothing defaults -currentHost write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int 0\nThe \"0\" disables font smoothing, while \"1\" enables light font smoothing, \"2\" enables default medium smoothing, and \"3\" enables strong smoothing. For example, if after disabling font smoothing you want to return to the default setting, replace the \"0\" at the end of the command with a \"2.\"\n", "Q: Restoring from new to old I have an iPad running iOS 15 and also one running iOS 10 (not upgradeable). Can I use the iOS 10 iPad as a backup for the newer one?\n\nA: You can go forward, restoring backups made on previous versions of iOS\non to devices with newer versions of iOS.\nYou can not go backwards, restoring backups made on newer versions of iOS\non to devices with previous versions of iOS.\n", "Q: After upgrading/reinstalling some app using Homebrew, how to automatically set its notification settings? I found each time after I upgrade or reinstall Evernote, macOS prompts me for setting its notification permission settings. Could I make it sticky so I don't have to reset it each time? Or, could I set it with some command so I can run it together with the homebrew command to upgrade/reinstall?\n\nA: Just install the non-homebrew distribution of Evernote or, at least, don't use brew to update it. The latter isn't even supposed to happen, which is why you are un/re-installing it to update. The cask system in brew isn't really that useful and it is not intended to be used for updates.\nSee Why aren’t some apps included during brew upgrade? in the brew manual.\n", "Q: Repeated kernel panics: panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff8019f6799f): userspace watchdog timeout: no successful checkins from remoted since load My MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, Montery) freezes at the loading screen.

It could be bad hardware like an issue with the CPU, RAM or disk/storage controller.  It could also be software like if there is a programming bug instructing the OS to access something at a wrong address.\nWhile you say “no peripherals connected,” that’s not entirely true from the system standpoint. Mac computers are highly integrated now with wireless (802.11, Bluetooh, etc.) storage and a USB keyboard and trackpad, there are still peripherals that get connected without your awareness.\nFrom the panic, it appears to looking for a “connection” to something that didn’t get made due to a failed component.\nNow, keep in mind, the debug messages could be misleading because a number of things get loaded into memory, for example. If some code to drive your AirPort card, for example put it in bad memory, the data would be corrupt but it might lead you to believe your wireless is bad when it really isn’t.  Then again, it could be a bad wireless card writing bad data into good memory.  The point is, the debug info gives (a technician, programmer or engineer) a starting point for diagnosis.\nThat said, most (not all) kernel panics I’ve encountered we typically memory related.  I’ve solved ,any of these issues by replacing the cheap no-name memory modules with quality brands.  If your memory is now integrated (as almost all Mac computers are now), this will require a logic board replacement.  Either way, this is something  that needs to be diagnosed more comprehensively to be solved.\n", "Q: Change Display Scaling mode from 'Default' to 'More Space' in terminal/script I find myself switching between macOS scaling modes often, depending on what I'm doing. Some tasks require me to use the 'More Space' option, while I prefer regular browsing and use in the Default mode.\nIs there any way to change between these without hopping into System Preferences? Preferably from Terminal or using a script, which could be hooked up to Shortcuts.\n\nA: Frame challenge…\nYou could just change the default zoom in the browser, then you wouldn't have to keep changing the display.\n\nIf you wish, you can bulk select & remove existing sites to save dialling them all in separately, then define a new default underneath.\nYou can decide how much zoom you'd prefer by using  Cmd ⌘   +  or  -  on a web page & checking the number as it changes in the prefs pane.\n", "Q: iCloud Backup: How Does Turning off an App Affect The Backup? In order to complete the backup for my iPad, I needed to disable a few applications in the backup settings in order to allow it to fit within my available iCould space. This is not an issue as the data for these apps is actually already stored and backed-up elsewhere (or I just don’t care). My question however is:\nWhen I turn off an app in the backup settings, does that just remove the application data from the backup, or is it the entire application? I.e. Would I need to manually re-install the applications that are disabled when restoring from a backup, or just the data?\n\nA: iCloud backup only backs up your specific data that is stored in the application. The actual application bundle is not stored in the backup itself. Anything that is available from any of the Apple app or other content stores is re-downloaded at the point in time that you do a restore.\nThis KB article details what is included in an iCloud backup.\n", "Q: Why do Finder tags still appear on my Finder side pane when the tagged files are missing or not accessible? As a follow up to Does macOS store the tags of Finder separately from the tagged files?, I now understand that Finder tags are stored in the metadata of files, together in the same disk as the one that the file reside in. If the files are in a corrupt external disk file system, the metadata may not be easily recovered.\nHowever, I can see the list of tags on my Finder side pane. These are clearly the tags that were given to the files in the corrupt external disk file system, and not anywhere else eg. in my local disk. (I know this from my own memory.) Why can the tags still appear on my Finder side pane?\n(I ask this both out of curiosity, as well as in a small hope that, if Finder does store something about its tags separately from the files, the actual tags assigned to each file might still be recoverable.)\nI am hoping for an answer that does not just tell me whether my tags can be recoverable or not. I am hoping to know more details on how/where does Finder store the tags behind the scenes / under the hood.\nP.S. When I click on each tag on Finder, no files appear.\n\nA: I am not sure if this qualifies as an answer, rather it is my observations.\nThis is (I hope) a fact: The tags which appear in Finder's Sidebar are listed in /Users/gilby/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\nConjectures:\n\n*\n\n*The tags get into that list because they have been used at some time in past.\n\n\n*The presence of a tag in that list is not connected to whether there are any currently accessible files with that tag.\n\n\n*The presence of a tag is related to its use directly in Finder and not to its use in Spotlight searches even when instigated from within Finder.\nSome evidence for those conjectures:\n\n*\n\n*Add a new tag to a file. The tag then appears at the top of the Sidebar's list.\n\n*Remove the tag from the file. The tag is still in Sidebar's list even though there are no longer any matching files.\n\nSo, it seems that Sidebar's list gets augmented by used (in what way?) tags, but managing those tags is quite independent of whether the tags are still present on any files.\nThe unhappy conclusion is that the presence of the lost tags in Finder's Sidebar is not any help in restoring tags to files.\n\nA: I think Gilby is correct.\nIf it helps, you can customize which tags are displayed on the sidebar through the Finder preferences > tags. There, you can also delete old tags that no longer apply. The system will prompt you before you remove them, telling you if they're still in use in how many files (see below)\n\n", "Q: list of characters that have to be escaped in passwords for \"mount -t smbfs //username:password@...\" I am trying to mount a share with the macOS CLI using zsh as my shell.\nmount -t smbfs //user:password@host/share /share\n\nMounting the share without specifying the password works. But then I have to enter the password manually. As soon as I pass the password via the command line, I get an error message. I have a very strong password with many special characters, such as .()[]{}<>*=.\nmount_smbfs: URL parsing failed, please correct the URL and try again: Invalid argument\nmount: /share failed with 64\n\nPlacing the password in single or double quotes does not solve the problem. I assume that I have to enter the password without quotes and escape some of these special characters. Where can I find a list of characters that have to be escaped in passwords (or cannot be used at all)?\n\nA: I finally solved the problem differently. I changed to SSH key-based authentication, which is probably even safer than a long password with many special characters.\n\nA: Apple programs this into swift for which characters are allowed in the password field for a URL. Not entirely sure if this helps for the smbfs mount but it’s what I would use to have swift encode my password if I were passing it as you do in the command.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscharacterset/1417313-urlpasswordallowed\nTo implement this in code, you could use swift, php or python and these links covering specific of doing the url encoding and seeing if that alone help with escaping and quoting.\n\n*\n\n*encoding with swift and NSCharacterSet\n\n*Encoding with python\n\n*Encoding with php\n", "Q: Open Apple Wallet whilst Maps satnav is running This tends to occur when trying to buy fuel whilst on a journey.

When Apple Maps is running I can't get Wallet to come to the front. It just opens the map instead.\n\nA: A bit of lateral thinking got me out of this.\nAdd Wallet to the Control Centre. Then it's available with a swipe whilst the navigation is still running.\n\nFor an additional way to get to it, make Control Centre spring up using Back Tap.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13\" 2020 Left Fan at full speed even when computer is switched off One day after a long storage time I switched on my MacBook Pro 13\" 2020 (A2251) and the left fan was on at full blast all the time — even with the machine switched off. The fan (usually 8881 rpm) only switches off when the machine goes completely out of battery.\nI tried SMC and PRAM reset to no avail, reinstalling the operating system didn't help, etc etc. I downloaded MacsFanControl but I can't reduce the speed or switch off the fan using the software (btw, right fan is ok, usually at 0 rpm—maybe to compensate—but can be controlled ok using MacsFanControl). The laptop just went out of warranty and I would like to avoid bringing it in for repair.\nI am no expert but it feels like there must be some physical component (like a transistor) that has some issue. There was no water spillage whatsoever (not that I remember of at least), I just left the computer stored in a drawer inside its laptop case (protected from dust) for a few months while on parental leave. However, the computer was stored under a heavy pile of paper sheets (maybe 3-4 pounds). I'm unsure this could have caused the problem.\nCould a fan replacement help? I am not convinced of this option because the left fan is actually working, what is not working is the control of the fan speed. Any input is welcome!!\nThanks in advance you all!\nsil\n\nA: Update: I went to the local Apple Store and the person who helped me was able to solve the issue by just disconnecting and reconnecting fans and battery (and free of charge!). He said the connectors were securely in place, so maybe by unplugging the battery something got reset in the circuit (something that had not been fixed by SMC/PRAM reset). Thanks you all\n", "Q: Remove seen notifications from Notification Centre I am using MacOS Monterrey, and whenever I get notification from say, Slack, I get a temporary banner on my screen, which then hides in the notification tray. Then I open Slack (without using the Notification Centre), check the new message, but the notification stays in the Notification Centre as if I had never opened it. This is very annoying as at the end of the day my notification centre is full of banners about events I have already checked.\nIs there a way to automatically remove notifications from the Notification Centre when I have already checked them in the app? This is standard behaviour in things like Android.\nThanks!\n(PS I am very new to MacOS)\n\nA: I don't think there's a way to do this in Mac OS X.\n", "Q: Software Update shows multiple Command Line Tools updates for Xcode versions not even installed Following problems with the GNU gcc compiler installed through brew (messages about missing libraries that suddenly started appearing) I had to reinstall Xcode 13.4.1 yesterday.\nThis morning I’m now seeing several updates for Command Line Tools, for other versions of Xcode:\n\nWhy is this showing?

At present, every time I try to access something in a protected directory (e.g. Downloads, network volumes), I'm asked for permission, like this:\n\n“iTerm2” would like to access files on a network volume. (Don't Allow/OK)\n\nWhen I allow this access for Terminal even once, I'm never asked again and it just works. I've also tried giving iTerm2 “Full Disk Access” in Security & Privacy, and still get this. I think this is a bug of some kind, given the different behavior for Terminal. Does anyone know how to give iTerm2 (and other third party apps) this access?\n\nA: Enable Full Disk Access in Security & Privacy:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/-/wikis/fulldiskaccess\n\nA: Emre's answer is correct for iTerm2 in general, but for whatever reason this solution doesn't seem to work with the MacPorts package for iTerm2.

I am using \"Import from iPhone\" in Preview.app (open to other methods as well), but this method opens a preview \"page\" for every imported photo. Over time, this slows the process down and eventually crashes Preview.app once memory is exhausted.\nIs there any way to avoid opening each image as it imports?

Since the image is explicitly copyrighted, I will not include a copy of the image in this answer. What is important to note is that the image does not show an EFI partition. I assume the EFI partition shown in the OP's question was created when installing Linux and therefore should be removed.\n", "Q: \"Private\" data in ID3 tags created by Music Music.app deleted 21 or more audio files in an unexpected way.  Some of those files have \"Private\" ID3 data which exiftool says has an “Invalid ID3 frame size.”  Some of the files with the Private data were not undesirably deleted.  So, I believe the presence of this data is unrelated to the other issue.\nBut I wonder what the data is and why it was added to ten of 49 files which were all created the same way.\neyeD3 says PRIV: [Data: 395 bytes] for six; four have 361 bytes.\nexiftool says Private: (Binary data 380 bytes, use -b option to extract) with the the four saying 346 bytes.  So, all differ by 34 bytes, which maybe explains why exiftool also says Warning: Invalid ID3 frame size.\nDumping this private data to one file and running strings on it gave (among other things) “Abplist00” so I renamed it to temp.plist and tried to open it with XCode.  XCode complained “Failed to open property list: Conversion of string failed.”\nAnyone able to tell me what these might be and why they are there? \n\nA: My misconception: it was not created by Music.app, but by Amadeus Pro when I edited those files.\nUpdate: It is a bug that the author of Amadeus is aware of.  He didn’t say whether the bug is in Amadeus or in MacOS, but he has a version that either fixes or avoids the bug.\nTo reproduce, set all your MacOS encoding settings to UTF-8.  Open an MP3 file in Amadeus (the official version on the date I posted).  Add at least one marker, and put the name of the marker in Greek.

If I put an APFS filesystem on the drive it won't mount, any other kind of filesystem will mount.\nWhat might cause this?\n\nA: I happened to have another new-in-box My Book drive on hand, so I opened it up, connected it, told Time Machine to use it, and said go ahead and reformat it for Time Machine. It formatted the new drive with APFS, and then it wouldn't mount. That's when I realized the problem wasn't with the drive. I rebooted, and the new drive mounted fine. Unfortunately, I'd already reformatted the older drive and lost a years worth of backups. :(\nIn my defense, when I first Googled up the error message the answers I found pointed to a problem with the drive.

I was using a desktop wireless charger this morning and picked up my phone and felt it being noticeably hot to the touch. I measured the back of my phone about a minute or so after removing from the desk and it measured under an IR thermometer as 101F (38.33C).\nI recall reading someplace about certain car manufacturers putting the car battery in the trunk compartment to keep it out of the hot engine bay because heat degrades a battery's lifetime apparently. Could the same phenomena apply to phone batteries getting heated up via wireless chargers? The constant heat of an engine during the vehicle's operation isn't the same as an infrequent wireless battery charging of course but perhaps there's some amount of loss?\n\nA: In short: no.\nLonger: the following shows that even under the assumption that the different charging method raises temperature of the battery from 25 deg C to 35 deg C, the addition in degradation is minimal.\n Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12967\nI. e. it's a 6.5 % reduction in capacity instead of 4.2 % after 250 cycles. This experiment was also run with constant raises in temperature, not merely for an hour or so each day.\nBut, of course, the temperature on the outside isn't what's happening in the battery. The heat originates with the \"receptor\" structure. Since wireless charging tends to be slower than wired charging, I wouldn't be surprised if actual temperature in the battery is really lower in wireless charging.\n", "Q: Discrepancy in charging status of new battery in Macbook Air MacBook Air 13\", Early 2015\nmacOS Monterey 12.4 (21F79)\nI recently got the battery replaced. I am observing a difference in charging status depending on where I look. I never bothered to check these with the previous battery.\nWhen the light on Magsafe power adapter goes from amber to green, the battery status on the Menu Bar says 100% charged. But if I look at System Information > Power, it shows:\n\nFully Charged: No\nCharging: Yes\nState of Charge (%): 100%\n\ncoconutBattery app reports:\n\nCurrent Charge: 6871 mAh\nFull Charge Capacity: 7151 mAh\nCharge level: 96.1%\nDesign Capacity: 7150 mAh\nmacOS Battery Status: Good\n\nWhat can cause this problem? Does it look like a hardware or a software issue?\n\nFull Details from System Information:\nModel Information:\nSerial Number:    XYZ\nManufacturer: SMP\nDevice Name:  bq20z451\nPack Lot Code:    0\nPCB Lot Code: 0\nFirmware Version: 511\nHardware Revision:    000a\nCell Revision:    1200\nCharge Information:\nFully Charged:    No\nCharging: Yes\nFull Charge Capacity (mAh):   7151\nState of Charge (%):  100\nHealth Information:\nCycle Count:  9\nCondition:    Normal\nAC Charger Information:\nConnected:    Yes\nID:   0x07a1\nWattage (W):  45\nFamily:   0x00ba\nSerial Number:    0xXYZ\nCharging: Yes\n\nEdit 1: I did the following:\n\n*\n\n*Allowed the battery to drain all the way.\n\n*It stayed at 1% for some time and then the MacBook turned off on its own.\n\n*I let it be that way for 8-9 hours.\n\n*Charged the battery to 100%.\n\n*Switched on the MacBook. It restored the apps and open windows (does that mean it just went to deep sleep?).\n\nThe original problem that I reported above is still seen.\n\nEdit 2: As the battery level goes lower, the difference between values shown in Menu Bar and System Information keeps reducing. For example, when Menu Bar first shows 100%, the difference is around 4%. When the battery level reduces to around 25%, the two values shown are pretty much the same. Not sure what this really means.\n\nA: Coconut Battery tells you that the current Charging capacity is 96.1% of the Design Capacity.\nSystem Information is showing you that the battery is 100% full -- whatever its current capacity may be.\nThere is perhaps some confusion caused by the term \"Full Charge Capacity\", and what that means.\nThe laptop's power management will vary the full charge level somewhat across a number of cycles, as a means of preserving the life of the battery. So after a few more cycles, you may find that the Current Capacity is higher than 96.1%.\nApps that provide detailed information can be useful for trouble-shooting, but they just as often provide more information for you to worry about.\n", "Q: how to prevent numerous background daemons from harming gaming FPS (or other intense foreground workload performance)? One or another of the various macOS background daemons that comes with the operating system is always popping up and using a ton of CPU in the background.  This is generally slightly bothersome, but it's really annoying while I'm trying to play demanding video games that really need the system's full attention.  This visibly hurts the framerate and I need to go and investigate in iStat Menus or something to nuke the offending process manually.\nIs there a way to comprehensively pause or at least aggressively throttle all system background activity while I'm doing something demanding?  Mostly I want this for applications that are demanding of input responsiveness, like video games, but it would be nice for CPU intensive batch jobs that might take an hour or two to run, too; tell the system to please chill out in the background and not suck up either CPU or I/O to let the jobs run either more repsonsively or faster.\nI'm being non-specific because “Why is daemon X taking up so much CPU” is a common genre of question on this site and others like it (previously, previously, previously, previously, previously, previously, previously, previously, previously, previously, previously).  All of these daemons are implicated at various points.  Probably the worst offenders are syspolicyd, AMPDevicesAgent, and worst of all suggestd, but all the usual suspects show up at one point or another.\nAs such, I'm not looking for a blanket answer for how to fix these problems, because:\n\n*\n\n*There's too many of them; I am resigned to just having weird energy leaks and performance problems until Apple provides some more transparency for their background daemons.\n\n*At least for right now, they're mostly behaving themselves most of the time, and I realize they provide value by indexing things and doing stuff in the background to provide responsiveness in the moment.\n\n*With an Apple Silicon machine, they appear to mostly be persistently scheduled onto the Efficiency cores and have less of a devastating performance and battery impact than they used to, as a result.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is more of a temporary fix, which would allow me to simply quiet down the background performance interference rather than shutting it down completely.  I know the system needs this stuff to run for all the functionality to work and I don't want to take an axe to necessary parts of the OS, but I'd also like to get a consistent 120 FPS in 5-year-old games without dropping to 2-3FPS for a minute and getting killed because it was really important to Mail.app to make sure I could instantly search for some direct marketer's phone number because it downloaded a new message into its spam folder.\n\nA: You can pause long-running background processes like suggestd by running\npkill -STOP suggestd\n\nTo let it continue, use pkill -CONT suggestd (or reboot).\n", "Q: How can I configure my apple watch to always make and answer calls via the embedded eSim (not via iPhone)?

This is because the cellular service takes more than acceptable battery power.\nTherefore, there is no way to receive a call directly to the watch when the watch believes it's connected to the phone, because the watch is disconnected from the cellular network.\nFor outgoing calls, there does not appear to be a way to disconnect from the phone, from the watch, without also disabling cellular service (as Airplane mode does).\n\nIf your watch can't maintain a connection with your phone on Bluetooth it should hop onto your Wi-Fi network.

I press apple+shift+3. A thumbnail toast shows up in the bottom right corner. I click on it and it is what I wanted.\nIt opens in the preview app, but there is no menu bar. apple+c and ctrl+c do not copy it into memory. How do I copy the image into memory?\nI close the image. Then open it from the desktop. Then I can copy and paste it. Is there an easier way?\n\nA: There's an inherent difficulty in getting a screenshot to both file and clipboard. The screenshot app does one or the other, not both, so to have both you must actually allow it to finish saving the file to Desktop then open it in something you can copy to clipboard from, such as Preview.\nA slightly quicker method, which may at first seem counter-intuitive, is that if you select the file on the Desktop & copy it, the Finder quite cleverly copies all aspects of it & then can paste different aspects of the file, depending on where you paste to. Paste to a folder it will paste the file itself; to a web page it will paste the link to the file; to a text app it will paste the file's title; and to an image editor it will paste the image itself.\nClicking the screenshot floating thumbnail doesn't actually open it in the Preview app. It opens in a version of the QuickLook app [with extra annotation, similar but not identical to Preview]\nQuickLook\n\nYou can from here click the Share icon, top right & send it to Preview.\n\nPreview\n\nIf you want the initial floating thumbnail to go to the copy buffer, right click it before it vanishes & select Save to Clipboard.\n\nThis, however, will redirect it entirely & it will no longer save to desktop as well.\nYou could at this point send it straight to Preview app [which would lose it from the clipboard - there's no win/win here ;)\nAll of these choices are the same whether you use  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   3  or  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧    4.\nFrom either of these, adding  Ctrl ⌃  to the keyboard shortcut will send the image directly to Clipboard rather than file [yet again an either/or decision]\n Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   5  has its own prefs which you can change once it opens, rather than by adding  Ctrl ⌃ \nYou could actually eliminate the floating thumbnail entirely if you wished - this also makes the save to Desktop a bit faster. You do this by using the Options menu in  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   5 \n\nIf this all sounds a bit confusing, it's because these commands have kind of grown organically over many years, as new features were added. Once you understand them you can see the relationship they all have to each other, especially if you think of them as being oldest to newest, 3, 4, 5.\nThe newest  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   5  implementation has the most control over what you get from it - including fullscreen, window, selection snapshots as either stills or movies - with power comes complexity… but still has no way to send to both Clipboard & file in one shot.\n\nA: After capturing the whole screen with Command ⌘+Shift ⇧+3 and opening the thumbnail appearing at the bottom right, you can copy the image to the buffer by pressing Command ⌘+C. You can then paste the image wherever appropriate with Command ⌘+V.\nHowever, if you make any changes to the image within the window opening after clicking on the thumbnail (Quick Look window), you can not copy to the buffer either the image or the changes. With this Quick Look window, you can only copy the image to the buffer when it is pristine.\nThe other option is to take the screen capture directly into memory by pressing Command ⌘+Control ⌃+Shift ⇧+3. No thumbnail will appear in the bottom right. In addition to pasting it wherever you like with Command ⌘+V in that case, you can have it directly opened in a Preview window by pressing Command ⌘+N after opening Preview.\nSee the \"Take screenshots or screen recordings on Mac\" Apple Support webpage for more options and details.\n", "Q: Google Maps Lists only visible in Web Version not in Mobile App (Mac/Apple) after switching to a new iPhone (11 max pro), all my lists with saved places are gone on my phone but they are still there in my Google account when I access maps via Web.\nOn top of that, the minute I create a NEW list on my phone, then close and open the app, the list is gone again.

Start with a standard macOS Swift-based app project. Then add a Safari app extension target to the app.\nApple documents the process in more detail here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions/building_a_safari_app_extension\n", "Q: Is there a way to include both single and double quotes in a value to `defaults write` command? Let's assume I want to add this string to a preference domain:\na'b\"c\n\nCan I accomplish that with the defaults command?\nThese won't work (shell waits for further input):\ndefaults write testdomain testkey a'b\"c\ndefaults write testdomain testkey 'a\\'b\"c'\n\nNor does this (error \"Could not parse: a'b\"c.  Try single-quoting it.\"):\ndefaults write testdomain testkey \"a'b\\\"c\"\n\n\nA: This gets messy, because there are two layers of quote/escape interpretation (first by the shell, then by defaults), and they have somewhat different syntax rules. The short answer is to use \"'a\\\\'b\\\"c'\". Here's a demo:\n$ defaults write testdomain testkey \"'a\\\\'b\\\"c'\"\n$ defaults read testdomain testkey \na'b\"c\n\nTo figure out how to quote/escape a string like this, it's easiest to work backward through the layers: start with the final string you want to store, then figure out how to quote/escape that for defaults, then take the result of that and figure out how to quote/escape it for the shell.\nSo, we start with the final string to store:\na'b\"c\n\ndefaults likes complex strings to be quoted, and any of the same type of quote within the string need to be escaped with a backslash. So here's that string with defaults-compatible quoting:\n'a\\'b\"c'\n\nNow we have to figure out how to get the shell to pass that to defaults as an argument. Shell syntax doesn't allow single-quotes in a single-quoted string (even if they're escaped), so double-quoting it will be simpler. Within double-quotes, single-quotes don't require any special treatment, but double-quotes and escapes both need to be escaped. So you can use this:\n\"'a\\\\'b\\\"c'\"\n\nAnother possibility would be not shell-quote the string at all, but to individually escape all of the quotes and escapes in it:\n\\'a\\\\\\'b\\\"c\\'\n\n(The triple-escape there is an escaped escape, followed by an escape for the single-quote. Of course there's a relevant xkcd.)\n\nA: You new enough to replace \" with \\\". However, you need to do this again and also replace \\ with \\\\. So\na'b\"c\n\nbecomes\n\"a'b\\\"c\"\n\nwhich becomes\n\"\\\"a'b\\\\\\\"c\\\"\"\n\nafter two passes. From the command line, this can be tested by entering the following command.\neval echo \"\\\"a'b\\\\\\\"c\\\"\"\n\nThis command produces the following output.\na'b\"c\n\nIn your case, you would enter the following command.\ndefaults write testdomain testkey \"\\\"a'b\\\\\\\"c\\\"\"\n\nWhich can be verified with the following command.\ndefaults read testdomain testkey\n\nI actually tested this answer by using com.apple.Finder instead of testdomain.\n", "Q: Question regarding Filevault on M1 computers I wanted to ask this in this thread:\nWhat is the practical difference between an unencrypted, password-protected Mac and a FileVault encrypted Mac??\nbut it wouldn't let me because I'm a new user.

Are you saying that, at that stage, it is possible for someone to bypass that password requirement and gain access to the content of the (automatically encrypted by the OS) hard drive?\n\nA: Choosing between having a recovery key or using the iCloud method is largely a matter of personal choice. Neither option is universally \"better\":\nIf you're particularly worried about the iCloud system being exploited, you might prefer storing the key yourself. If you're the type that tends to forget where you put that important key when you need it a few years later, you might prefer going the iCloud way.\nAs for your second question; no, sharing the disk is not a requirement in order to access the disk in Recovery mode. For most practical purposes, you cannot rely on the user account password to protect the data contents of your computer from a possible intruder. Enabling FileVault is on another level of protection entirely.\n", "Q: Qt on Windows on Series M MacBooks I'm current using Parallels to run Windows Pro on MacBook 16\" with intel CPU. On it I do my Qt/C++ stuff that target x86/64.\nHow is that going to work on new series M MacBooks?\nI heard we can still install Windows on Parallels, but it's Windows for ARM?\n\nA: On an Apple Silicon Mac, you can run Windows 11 using, for example, Parallels.\nYou're right it is Windows for ARM, but to the user it looks exactly the same as Windows 11 for Intel. Windows for ARM allows you to run x86/x64 programs, similar to how Rosetta 2 works for Mac programs.\nThere are a few limitations, most importantly x86/x64 device drivers do not work - you will need ARM drivers for your devices. This is usually not a problem in practice though.\nAlso note that you cannot do nested virtualization, i.e. do not expect to be able to run VMware inside the Windows 11 for ARM machine in order to run full x86/x64 virtual machines. That is not possible with hardware acceleration - you can do it with purely software virtualization, but that is really slow.\nI don't know what specifically you use Qt for - but in general, the Qt tools work fine on macOS - and also on Apple Silicon. Instead of doing your work in Windows, you could consider simply installing Qt and your development environment natively in macOS. Then you could create Qt applications without Windows. You could still use Windows on Parallels for testing the programs on Windows ofcourse.\nNote that it is no problem to cross-compile applications, so even though you're working on an Apple Silicon Mac, you can create executables for Windows with x86/x64 code!\n", "Q: Performance of Parallels VM from Bootcamp partition vs. VM on macOS partition Parallels allows us to run a Windows VM on macOS.\nOn older Macs, we were able to run Windows on Boot Camp, which was an alternative to a VM.\nInterestingly, if we install Windows on Boot Camp we can, from macOS Parallels, run that Windows as a VM.\nNow to the question: we generally say a VM will be a little bit slower than Windows running directly on hardware.\nWhat about a VM from the Boot Camp partition vs. a VM on a macOS partition? Which one is supposed to be faster?\n\nA: Comparable performance\nAccording to this Parallels document, performance for both a Boot Camp-based VM and a file-based VM are comparable (both get an \"OK\" performance rating):\n\nDrawbacks of running Windows from a Boot Camp partition\nThe table above also provides more information on the pros and cons of running Windows from a Boot Camp partition and in a virtual machine, so even if the former were slightly faster, it may be more convenient to run Windows in a VM if you value easy backup and VM portability to another Intel-based Mac.\nFurthermore, note that using Windows from Boot Camp may cause Windows or some of its application to ask for reactivation, as explained in this Parallels support article.\n\nA: When comparing running a VM from the Boot Camp partition with running a VM from a macOS partition, the first will be ever so slightly faster!\nThe reason for the speed difference is that in the first case, each read/write will go through your Windows guest file system (for example NTFS or ExFAT) and then directly to your block device - whereas in the second case, each read/write will go through first your Windows guest file system and then your macOS host file system (for example APFS or HFS+) - and finally to your block device.\nThe difference in perceived performance depends a lot on your particular use case. In general, it is not worth moving an existing setup to a Boot Camp partition only to get this (very marginal) speedup. I would seek such a setup only if you want to take advantage of the fact that you can actually boot that partition up in Boot Camp without virtualization.\nKeep in mind that having the your guest file system stored on the host file system (instead of on a separate partition) typically makes it easier to dynamically change how much space it uses up on your drive.\n", "Q: San Disk Extreme 1TB SSD (1050Mb/s) taking up 10 times more storage than actual size Just got a Sand Disk Extreme SSD, intially this 14gb filled the SSD to full, formatted it on windows with default allocation size and exFat format, still did the same.\nThen formatted it on MacOS and now 14.89GB is taking up 125GB of storage.\nI want to keep using exFat or similar format which can be used on Windows and Mac both, but ensure that the allocation size is not filling up the whole disk, preferably exFat.\nAttached the image of the info of that folder.\n\n\nA: For small files, you need to be careful about how efficiently the file system store them.  For example, for a 1kb file, what if it is taking up the minimum block size of 32kb or 64kb?\nAnd when you have thousand of these files, it can affect your storage capability in a big way.\nSo you need to do some research as to what file system can do the best for your case, and also, would you zip up the small files into one big file?  Usually, if you have many big files (such as 500MB or 1GB or larger), then 32k or 64k block size is not going to affect you that much.\n", "Q: Open Superdrive mini-menu - where's this from? Mac Pro 5,1 with built-in Superdrive. macOS Mojave.\nAfter several reboots where I was changing 'Displays have separate Spaces' - ie nothing at all relevant to the Superdrive - this extra menu item appeared in the right side of the menu bar.\n\nI've never seen it before. I assume it's from some 3rd party utility but I can't think what. I doubt it's an Apple system utility, as it seems to have [visually] hijacked F12, rather than the default Eject button. [I say visually, because all it does is beep when I actually press F12, it doesn't actually function as Eject. The real Eject key still works.] Selecting Open Superdrive from the menu item itself does open the drawer.\nHas anyone any idea what this might belong to, or how to get rid of it?\n\nA: I think that's the Eject menulet, which is found here:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Eject.menu\n\nYou should be able to get rid of it in the usual way, by holding down Command while dragging it off.\nIIRC, F12 was a substitute for open/close on keyboards that didn't have a dedicate eject button.\n", "Q: Lost iPhone. 2FA Initial situation:\nYou are new to the Apple world, but you know that if you have 2 iPhones and one is lost, you can use the other iPhone to lock the lost one via the Find My app. But they must be connected to the same Apple ID.\nBut what if you only have a single phone and that phone even has the trusted phone number for 2FA from the Apple ID.\nThen couldn't the thief reset the phone or iCloud with the phone number?\nAnd would that mean you'll never find your phone again because you can't locate it? If you think buying a new iPhone, signing in with the Apple ID and then locking it like that doesn't work, 2FA is required and we don't have the phone number.\nWhat now?\n\nA: In the, quite ordinary, case of having only a single phone - you should remember that other devices can also be setup for 2FA. If you have a Mac, an iPad, iPod Touch or similar - you can get the 2FA code displayed on there. That will allow you to use a web-browser with icloud.com to locate and lock (or even remote wipe) the lost phone.\nIf a thief steals the phone with the trusted phone number for 2FA, he wouldn't be able to just immediately \"reset your iCloud\" or anything like that:\nFirst of all, the iPhone would usually be protected by a pass code and possibly biometrics like TouchID and FaceID. It is your responsibility to choose a sensible pass code, so that the thief cannot guess this with a few attempts (i.e. don't choose 123456 or 111111). If the thief tries to guess too many times, the phone introduces an increasing delay before allowing a new attempt. In addition, you can set the phone to auto-wipe after a high number of failed pass code attempts.\nSecondly, the thief cannot just request a 2FA code to be sent by text for example. In order to be able to do that, he would need to first know your iCloud account password. It is your responsibility to choose a reasonably complex and unique password, and keep it secret.\nFinally, you should call your phone company and get your SIM card cancelled/locked when you discover the theft. This will stop it from receiving texts (as well as stopping the thief from using the SIM card in other devices should the PIN code be guessable or disabled).\n", "Q: Is there a way to copy content from a broken (no display) m1 macbook to another m1 macbook? The broken MacBook is an M1, still turns on, but the display is broken so no visual. There are no external monitors to connect either. I don't wanna do any open-heart surgery on the broken MacBook either, such as removing the disk etc.\nI found that we can connect the two MacBooks using USB-C or Thunderbolt cable, then use the Target Disk Mode. Unfortunately, to do this, the broken MacBook needs to have a display which I don't have.\nWhat other pragmatic approaches do I have to get the content copied to the new MacBook?\n\nA: The most pragmatic approach here is to connect an external display. That will let you login as normal on your M1 laptop, and from there you can copy over files to network storage, USB storage or similar.\nA tool such as Carbon Copy Cloner can help you easily create a full copy of everything.\n", "Q: External Monitor Sound Volume Slider AND auto switching I just switched from an iMac to a MacBook 14 inch. I've swapped out my iMac with a Samsung HDMI monitor with a speaker, and it plays sound correctly. However, the volume slider is disabled. I could fix this with Proxy Audio device, as it routed the sound through a volume-changing-compatible device to the monitor. However, when I unplugged my MacBook to go places, I had to change my sound output back to the internal speakers because the Samsung monitor was no longer attached. Then I tried creating a multi-output device with both the monitor and built-in speakers, but the monitor had enough lag that it was nearly impossible to listen to anything with the monitor making a louder echo of the MacBook (which I keep in a vented cabinet with a dock).\nSo this is my request - can I have my Mac switch to my monitor speakers, with full volume control, when I plug in my monitor, then switch back to the internal speakers when I unplug the monitor? Finally, if this cannot be done for free, I'll just switch the output myself every time I leave or consider using the macbook's internal speakers. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I positioned the macbook below my monitor for cooling reasons, and now the speakers are loud enough so I dont need external speakers.\n", "Q: Encryption on iPhone without a lock screen password Is encryption on iPhone enabled by default even if there is no lock screen password?\n\nA: It depends on what you mean with encryption. The filesystem is encrypted at all times, even though it doesn't look like that to apps: to apps, the files appear normal but they are always stored encrypted on the flash storage.\nContent in the keychain may be encrypted in memory or not, but access permissions may be different depending on whether the device is locked or not. Developers can mark each entry their apps write to the keychain with the required permissions (see the Accessibility Values section).\nAll of this is completely independent of your device password.\nThe Apple Apple\nPlatform Security Guide (see also the main page) has a lot of details about the security architectures. Unfortunately, I couldn't find details about purely local keychain content, but iCloud keychain content is encrypted using a key derived from your account password and a device-local key stored in the Secure Enclace. See the whole \"iCloud keychain\" chapter and in particular, the \"How a user’s other devices are added to the syncing circle\" chapter for details. I suspect the local keychain content is also protected by the same device-local key but this is just a guess, I'm afraid.\n", "Q: Can't enable SSH on Catalina - System Preferences keeps saying \"Remote Login starting...\" I just did a complete reinstall of my late 2012 Mac Mini, with the latest OS it supports: Catalina (10.15.7). I'm trying to enable remote login via SSH, but when I check the box in System Preferences → Sharing, it keeps saying \"Remote Login starting...\" and I can't connect to it via SSH.\n\nIt looks like the same problem mentioned here. How can I fix this?\n\nA: The problem can be solved by manually adding the relevant launch daemon yourself via the Terminal, with the following command:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist\n\n", "Q: Should my CPU load be that high? I have a mid-2009 13\" core 2 Duo MacBook Pro running High Sierra w/ upgraded 8 Gb RAM.\nOn Activity Monitor I usually get 20-40% 'idle CPU' with only Finder, Safari (3 tabs) and Activity Monitor opened.

(Or, is M1 more RAM efficient?) My current laptop runs an i7 with 16GB RAM. However, I'm looking to upgrade for compatibility with macOS Ventura in the fall. New M1 Macs being expensive, I'm looking to slim down the cost while still having necessary performance. Would 8GB + M1/M2 work better or at least the same as / comparable to i7 + 16GB?\nEDIT: My computer's processor is \"MF843LL/A 3.1 GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor\", early 2015. Does that give more information?\n\nA: It is impossible to say with the information you have given. There's more than a factor of 10 difference in performance between the slowest i7 processors and the fastest i7 processors. Knowing exactly the specific models you're comparing is vital here.\nThe question of \"RAM-efficiency\" really hasn't got much to do with the CPU itself. As the i7 CPUs and the Apple Silicon CPUs are all 64-bit processors, there's not much about the CPU that determines \"RAM-efficiency\" - that is almost entirely down to the operating system and your applications.\nThere are minor advantages to modern CPUs in terms of having a performance surplus that allows you to enable better memory compression than you would on a really old system - and there are some benefits of having multiple page sizes, etc. However, that usually does not make any practical difference when comparing a fairly recent i7 to the Apple Silicon CPUs.\nUPDATE\nYou have now specified that you're comparing with an i7-5557U processor. That's a CPU from 2015. In terms of generic benchmarking, you would expect even the slowest M1 CPU to be 4-5 times faster than your old CPU. However, remember that's benchmarking and doesn't apply 1:1 to your actual work-flow. Especially make note that there's a big difference between single-threaded performance and multi-threaded performance on modern CPUs.\nAlso note that this type of benchmarking only relates to the compute-performance of the CPU - not to the entire system that makes up the computer. The difference in RAM size (8 GB vs 16 GB) can make a huge difference for your particular work-flow. I.e. if you mainly use your computer for things that take up 16 GB of RAM, but really does not use the CPU - then that is probably going to run less smooth on an 8 GB system.\nTo sum it up, noting that it is highly subjective and really dependent on your particular work-flow, then in general most users would expect and find that a new M1 system performs vastly better than an i7 2015 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Just upgraded my intel based systems to M1 too, so did quite a lot of benchmarking over the weekend. Tested quite a few old macbooks and even old top spec trashcan MacPro.\nIt is subjective and I am sticking my neck out there, yes, M1 based MacBook Air or Pro, even at the lowest spec of 8GB RAM can easily outperform the top of class 2015 MacBook. (Geekbench on CPU is clear, I have attached the results below too.)\nYour concern about RAM usage efficiency, it depends on your use case. If you handle lots of large videos or photos, you probably would be struggling on the 16GB intel a bit anyway, talking about opening many files of hundreds of MB or a few GB loaded in RAM like photos/videos/Database/etc.\nTry not to just focus on CPU/RAM. The overall system is much faster with latest architecture. SSD read/write is much faster than the 2015 system. T2 features embedded are often overlooked too, it is much faster for some \"niche\" sec to encode/decode videos/images or just for better FaceTime quality with it.\n(Consider spending the extra 200 bucks to get to 16GB RAM and your new upgrade will be every bit/byte better, it will help your new mac to last for another 5-7 years. And with better resell value at the end.)  :)\nTo share a couple more things from my recent upgrade:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you check the Activity Monitor, look for all Intel apps that are running, go and hunt down the M1 ready version. Running Intel apps will slow it down a lot and eats up a lot of resources. Use this site too, https://isapplesiliconready.com/, they have listed many M1 ready apps. Over 70% of apps are M1 ready.\n\n*SSD and other IO speed is much better than older Macbooks. Thunderbolt cables are not cheap, but very fast, I was running Migration Assistant at 1800 MB/Sec, that's crazy (I only had TB3 cable between 2 M1 macs, wish I had TB4 cable).\n\n*M1 can't easily use Intel based virtual machines, like VirtualBox, etc.\n\n*Universal Control with newer Macs and iPads is very cool.\n\n*Some iPhone and iPad apps can run on your M1 Mac, great for developers to port apps to desktop.\n\nhttps://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/15420735?baseline=14662136\n\n", "Q: How can I change the date format of the backup display in Time Machine?

The current plan is for them to use my iPhone 12 and for me to purchase a new iPhone 14 (Pro, if it comes with USB 3.0 lightning).\nI will be travelling and staying in the US in August. They will travel with me, but travel back before September. Therefore, there won't be enough time for me to purchase a new iPhone 14 and give my old phone to them. Our current plan is for me to temporarily use their iPhone 8 while I wait for the release of the new iPhone 14.

As long as you are able to activate over and use previous generation cellular network, you should be fine.\nBoth iPhone 12 and iPhone 8 can run the current latest version of iOS, so make sure to update to the latest version of iOS (iOS 15.5 as of this writing) before backing up your iPhone 12 and also upgrade iPhone 8 to use the same.\nAnother thing to note is to check if the backup size is reasonably under the storage size of iPhone 8 and as that would ensure that you will be able to restore the backup onto it.\nThe above are the major considerations to keep in mind and you'd be fine. To answer your specific questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will confidential data, like health data, be lost?\n\n\nNo. Make sure you have iCloud sync enabled for Health app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will I have to log in to Apple ID again? Will this mess up trusted device and iCloud?\n\n\nWhile Apple ID login isn't required to use the phone functionality, it's recommend if you are looking at restoring all the data such as Contacts, Health and iCloud data onto the iPhone 8.\nI don't understand what you mean by messing up trusted device and iCloud, but this exercise should remove iPhone 12 from the list of devices associated with your Apple ID and add iPhone 8 to the list.\n\nWill applications that requires my Face ID for certain privileged tasks no longer work?\n\nThe apps that rely on biometric authentication would use Touch ID as authentication mechanism instead of Face ID. You would need to set them up again on your iPhone 8, but once done, they'd work fine and it won't matter if you authenticate via Touch ID.\nDo not consider Touch ID or Face ID to be inferior/superior to one another or having more/less features. Think about them as alternate means of authentication with them having their own pros and cons in terms of usage and convenience. (Touch ID works even with a face mask/covering on and more than one member can register their fingers, but may fail to work if you have wet fingers. Face ID can be more seamless on the other hand).\n\n\n*\n\n*Will applications require me to login again or setup again, especially for 2FA apps like Duo and Google Authenticator?\n\n\nYes. But please note that if you have a 2FA code generator app such as Google Authenticator installed on your iPhone 12, you may lose access to the codes when attempting to restore the Google Authenticator app onto iPhone 8. A workaround that I use is to either disable 2FA on all the websites added into Google Authenticator, or regenerate the codes in an app such as 1Password that saves the data on cloud.\n", "Q: Password protect Apple ID settings on iPhone Can a password be set for preventing the access to this screen once iPhone is unlocked?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't set a password, but you can prevent access to the Apple ID settings screen with Screen Time:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app.\n\n\n*Open Screen Time.\n\n\n*Open Content & Privacy Restrictions.\n\n\n*Open Account Changes, select \"Don't Allow\" and tap \"Back\":\n\nNow the Apple ID link in Settings should be grayed out and unselectable.\nI'd recommend that you set a passcode with the option \"Use Screen Time Passcode\" in Setings > Screen Time to prevent others from changing back the setting.\nIf you wish to access the Apple ID screen, go through the steps above but select \"Allow\" instead.\n", "Q: 508 Accessibility: English Siri misreads certain roman numerals For any multiple of 5 and its preceding value, Siri reads the value as a literal character rather than a number. For instance, the numbers 4, 5, 9, 10 are read as the characters I-V, V, I-X, X rather their numeric equivalent. I assume this is the case for all Siri languages, but I'm only concerned with English.\nUPDATE: I'm not sure how I can clarify my request. Siri speaks certain roman numerals (not all) as characters meaning that it doesn't recognize them as numerals, but text. Why the inconsistency? It can recognize III as 3, but not recognize IX as 9? Is it because some numerals have modern uses, like IV now could be short for \"intravenous\", or that XI is Chinese she?\nHow do I correct this?\n\nA: Short answer, you can’t do anything about it.\nLong answer, all of this depends on the speech synthesizer being used. Four people that use screen readers like Apple‘s voiceover, or any Windows based screen readers, there are a host of different voices available to suit a persons liking. Each one of those voices has different pronunciation styles, idiosyncrasies, and quirks. All of this depends on the internal rules of the synthesizer. For screen readers, there are internal dictionary‘s to adjust the pronunciation of words to better fit language.

I have an external hard drive that on these hot days suffers of overheating. So I thought that I could bypass the problem by slowing down the speed of the transfer of the files, it will take longer, but at least it won't switch off after about twenty minutes from the start.\n\nA: You're going after the wrong solution!\nJust keep the drive cool. You can possibly improve air circulation, or you can make sure the airflow around the drive isn't blocked. Or perhaps it was just poorly designed, and you should consider a drive with better cooling.\nOr your fan may not be working properly. Open things up and see if there is a lot of dust restricting air flow, or perhaps some hair got caught up in the fan.\n\nA: Connect the drive to the Mac through a powered USB 2 hub. This will force the drive to use USB 2 transfer speeds.\nFor example, here is an image taken from System Information after connecting an USB HDD connected directly to the USB port on a 2013 iMac. This image shows the transfer speed is up to 5 Gb/s.\n\nAfter connecting the drive through a powered USB 2 hub, the image shown below shows the transfer speed is now up to 480 Mb/s.

So my current status is:\n$ profiles status -type enrollment\nEnrolled via DEP: No\nMDM enrollment: No\n\nCan I just do a Software Update at the System Preference and update to Monterey without risking to enroll my device or I should follow some additional steps?\nI wouldn't like to do a fresh install as I would keep all my system files etc in place since I am using this machine purely for development so it would be a long thing to restore everything.\n\nA: The process of enrolment of a Mac through Apple Device Enrolment (what used to be called Device Enrolment Program) cannot happen to a Mac unless it is listed in an organisation's Apple Business (or school) Manager account as owned by them. So if you are getting an enrolment pop up that means it is an organisation's Mac and you are trying to avoid giving them the privileges that are theirs by ownership of the Mac.\nHowever, automatic enrolment is not triggered by upgrading the OS. It is only triggered if the machine is brand new or the drive has been reset with the drive erased and a new version of the OS installed.\nYou are getting the enrolment pop ups because the Mac regularly checks to see if it is listed in a Manager account.\nMy advice is to give in. Say yes to an enrolment pop up. Unless the Mac has been stolen, in which case I would wipe the drive, drop it on a table at an Apple store and walk out.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Retina Early 2015 – Trackpad working, but no tactile feedback and no trackpad settings ✅ SOLVED FYI: Apple veteran (first Mac 1989), would call myself a Pro (unfortunately not at board level).\nI have a 13\" MBPR Early 2015 (A1502) here on which the internal trackpad fully works, but doesn't provide tactile feedback. The machine had a bloating battery (which I've removed; new battery waiting to be installed, once following trackpad problem is resolved). If I recall correctly the tactile engine/haptic feedback worked when I received the machine, but either stopped due to the further bloating battery or in the process of updating the macOS (which also has updated the board’s EFI). No water damage, machine is otherwise in perfect condition.\nWhen opening System Preferences > Trackpad, it tells me that it doesn't find the trackpad and shows me a bluetooth connected Magic Trackpad, to which it would like to connect (perhaps as alternative as it thinks it's missing the internal trackpad, however there never was such a Magic Trackpad paired with that MBPR). ***)\nRe missing trackpad: According to System Profiler > SPI the trackpad is there.\nI've tried literally everything:\n\n*\n\n*SMC Reset (countless times)\n\n*NVRAM Reset (countless times)\n\n*installation of two identical, known to be good Trackpad Flex Cables 821-00184-A\n\n*installation of two identical, known to be good Trackpad assemblies 810-00149-A\n\n*Safe Mode boot\n\n*re-installation of macOS Monterey\n\n*booting in Recovery Mode, erasing the SSD Volume group, restarting and installing Big Sur from bootable macOS Installer USB drive\n\n*swapping the SSD (!) with a different macOS version\n\n*deleting various related .plist files\n\nApple Diagnostics (formerly known as AHT Apple Hardware Test; \"D\" at boot) reports no damage/error. I know ... bloated battery might lead to broken flex cable, but I've replaced that already twice and even tried replacing the trackpad as such, as you can read above).\n\nBottom line\nI'm at my wits’ end. The only thing I could imagine is either a hiccup in the board’s EFI or that the tension on the trackpad’s flex cable due to the bloated battery has lifted the FPC connector on the board (though nothing’s visible under a magnifier). Or it’s an active on-board component which is in charge of the tactile engine and passed away.\nIdeas?\n\n\n\n***) Update 1: Trackpad now shown again in System Settings > Trackpad ... still no haptic feedback\nIt’s absolutely crazy: I've learned here that the Trackpad preferences don't show up properly (and instead present the image of the Apple’s Magic (Bluetooth) Trackpad, as seen in the now striked screenshot above), if the battery is not present. Would be good if some board level expert could explain the reason why with a comment below.\nSo the Trackpad Prefs Pane is fully functional again, yet the Tactile Engine still provides no feedback. Changed the Trackpad settings back and forth, rebooted, SMC & NVRAM reset, basically tried the whole sh*t again ... still: Trackpad fully functional except for haptic feedback.\nUpdate 2: Issue resolved ... but had to take a strange path\nMy friend and partner in crime asked an interesting question this morning: How does the Trackpad behave under Windows or Linux? (Being an Intel machine it can boot either natively).\nSo I created a bootable USB drive using Etcher and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS amd64. Booted from it, wiped the SSD using Ubuntu’s Disk Utility and installed Ubuntu on the SSD. Rebooted from the SSD. Still: Trackpad working but no haptic feedback. Left the machine alone for about an hour but saw when I left, that Ubuntu had began downloading updates, drivers etc. When I returned ... hallelujah! Tactile Engine was suddenly back. (I can't say whether the Ubuntu had rebooted meanwhile, as the system was set to Auto-Login).\nSo haptile feedback is back. The odyssey however continued for brief moment: Booted in Recovery Mode (CMD-R), which came up via Internet with an ancient El Capitan (10.11) Installer. The problem: Apple’s Disk Utility did not show the internal drive. Externals yes, but no internals.\nCreated a bootable USB drive with a Big Sur Installer, using Install Disk Creator, booted from it and surprisingly Disk Utility in that version/package showed the internal drive and allowed me to format it APFS. From there on everything went smoothly. Machine fully working again and running on macOS Monterey.\nThis Horror Story did cost me almost two full days...\nP.S.: In the end, there was no hardware damage at all, although expected otherwise. All mentioned flex cables and all trackpad assemblies tested again and all units work.\n\nA: Problem solved as described in Section „Update 2“ of question above (for details see above, here’s the recap):\n\n*\n\n*Created bootable USB drive with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS amd64 using Etcher.\n\n*Booted from that (alt-Key pressed after Restart).\n\n*Formated SSD using Disk Tool in Ubuntu.\n\n*Installed Ubuntu on SSD and rebooted from SSD.\n\n*Let Ubuntu install its proposed drivers and updates.\n\n*Restarted Ubuntu.\n\n*Haptic feedback should be back by now.\n\n*As Internet Recovery (CMD-R immediately after Restart) comes up with an old macOS El Capitan (10.11) environment and the included Disk Utility version doesn't find the internal drive/SSD: Using another Mac downloaded Big Sur or Monterey from Apple’s App Store and created a bootable USB drive with that macOS Installer using Install Disk Creator.\n\n*Booted from that USB drive (alt-Key pressed after Restart).\n\n*Opened Disk Utility and formatted now found internal SSD to APFS.\n\n*Installed macOS on internal SSD.\n\n", "Q: Two different computers, same home folder name: trouble? I have an old MBP (running El Capitan) with the home folder name: firstlast (that's made up, but you get it). I just got a new computer, and during setup it suggested \"firstlast\" again as my home folder, and I hesitated, but moved forward with it. So, I have two different apple computers with the same home folder and user account name.\nToday, on the new machine, I set up Filevault and used the iCould choice for the recovery key (which I know means I set up iCloud to be able to reset my computer password). I later changed my new computer password to a stronger one. Then I wanted to change the old computer password as well. When I turned on that computer, I got the ? blinking folder. After some work, I got it going, and when I tried to sign in, it wouldn't take the old password, but it took the one I set up for the OTHER, new computer. It seems that maybe iCloud changed it on the old computer in the background?? It's kind of freaky.\nAnyway, my question is, do you think it will screw things up if I change the home folder name on my old computer to something else, like \"flast\" instead of \"firstlast\", so that the computers have different home folders? I feel like having two computers with the same home folder name is asking for trouble... (a bit of which I seemed to have today!)\n\nA: I suspect that you were logged into iCloud on both machines, and that iCloud Drive (not the same thing as iCloud) was set to synch some of all of their contents including the Home folders.\nThere's nothing wrong with this; I've had two Macs (running different macOS versions) for decades with same-named home folders and content, synched via iCloud. I find it very convenient to have the same content immediately available on both machines: I don't have to remember what's where, or what name is a file that's on the machine in front of me.\nI suggest you learn more about iCloud and iCloud Drive, what they do and how to set then up. Here is Apple's Support Page on iCloud, and here is Apple's Support Page for iCloud Drive.\n", "Q: Possible to read text record from NFC tag within Shortcuts? Which Shortcut action reads an NFC text record?\nExample:\n\n*\n\n*NFC tag is written with a text record: Office\n\n*Shortcut trigger: NFC\n\n*Within the automation steps, how can I read the Office value of the text record?\n\n\nA: I believe since iOS 15 you are able to. I just did a test and was able to write three different tags with a shortcut trigger and text.\nI wrote the following to the tag:\nshortcuts://run-shortcut?name=Test&input=text&text=Lounge\nI then create the following shortcut to speak the text which from the tag:\n\nI wrote a few more tags with different text and test and it correctly scan and read them out.\nI am currently using to create automation triggers for Homekit.\n\nA: Shortcuts cannot currently read NFC tags. They can only trigger an action based on the tag's unqiue ID.  So you can have a tag launch a specific Shortcut but that Shortcut cannot read any additional data from the tag (currently).  If you write your own app it can fully read and write the tag data including embedding records like URLs that can be suggested without any app required.\n", "Q: Is it possible to share a Shortcut Automation with others? I'm just starting to play with iPhone Shortcut Automations. They are really cool for personal productivity projects. But what about deploying to a team, department or entire org (whom all use iPhones)?\nIs it possible to share a Shortcut Automation? Maybe export it, save it under version control and have others within the team/dept/org download it and use it?\n\nA: Would it work if you create Shortcut Automation as a \"normal\" Shortcut (which apple explains how to share as @Lano already pointed out)\nThen in Shortcut Automation you create an Automation that uses the Run Shortcut command to run the shared shortcut.\nYour team still has to manually setup the Shortcut Automation, but does not have to \"program\" the entire Shortcut.\n", "Q: How to go to help menu for C++ while using Xcode? I used to use TurboC++ in my school.\nIf I had a doubt as to how to use a keyword or function (in the syntax or the order of arguments), I only had to write it on screen and right-click on the word and it would lead me to the help screen of that particular function or keyword. It also included an example program showing how it is implemented.\nDoes Xcode have any similar features for C++?\n\nA: Yes, Xcode has a similar feature. You can right-click on the function you want explained and select \"Quick Help\" - this will show a small popup with a summary of the function as well as a link for more documentation.\nYou can also use the keyboard shortcut Cmd-Opt-3 to open a sidebar on the right which will show the quick help at all times. I.e. if you move the cursor to a new function, the sidebar will automatically update with the help text for that function.\n", "Q: How to get the ${DISPLAY} outside of the X environment I would like to make a shell script and an Applescript script to fire an\nX environment command when this environment is active ( through XQuartz for example ). But not just upon starting the X environment\n( which is straight forward ).\nTo achieve this I need the value of the X environment variable:\n${DISPLAY}\n\nI thought that an easy method would be to store this value in a ${HOME}/.display\nfile from a ${HOME}/.xinitrc and remove this file on exit ( trap or sequential execution ).\nIs there any \"good\", \"experimented\", clean and safe method to get this value outside of the X environment?\n\nA: There's no one \"correct\" way of transferring data, such as the contents of that environment variable, from one program to another. There's multiple options with varying levels of complexity, reliability, security, etc.\nYou can basically do whatever suits you best ranging from very simple to very complex. For example, when you know you have the X display server on the local computer, the enviroment variable just contains the display number and the screen number. You could let the user enter those values themselves, just letting the shell script prompt the user.\nA much more complex way would be to setup a SQL database where you can store the value of the environment variable. You could have a program running in the X session that continually updates the data so that you could detect the X session being closed. This would in almost all cases be a terrible approach that is basically overkill.\nThe middle ground is simple, but not too simple, methods such as having a file with a well-known name where you store the contents. Or you could have a named pipe established where you can receive the contents.\n", "Q: Importing old photos on a Mac, but excluding them from view in an iOS library - possible? I've attached an external drive with 1000s of old photos and imported them into the OSX Photos app. The aim is for macOS Photos to analyse them, detect faces then a) include these photos in memories video and b) make them searchable on my iOS devices (this is the key bit).\nBasically I'm trying to replicate Google Photos functionality.\nI tried an initial import of about 5000 photos into macOS Photos, and it worked fine - faces began scanning. Great.\nHowever.... when I checked my iPhone, my 'Recents' album grew by 5000 photos, some appearing before current snaps, and others appearing after.\nThis is problematic for me as I use the Recents album to check photos I've taken recently, and don't want to see snaps taken in 2010 in there.\nIs there any way to run this import, sync via iCloud Photos and NOT see the imported ones in 'Recent'? I just want them in cloud album / folder for occasional access\nHope this makes sense! Thanks\n\nA: The \"recents\" album is not sorted by date the photo was taken. For example, if you receive and import a photo from somebody that was taken 1 year ago, it will appear in the most recent spot in your Recents album despite being an old photo.\nIf you want to see photos you've recently imported, use the recents album.\nIf you want to see photos you've recently taken/created, use the main tab in the Photos app that is sorted chronologically by the photos metadata.\n", "Q: How to restore an individual file from Time Machine using CLI (MacOS) How can I restore a single file from an old Time Machine backup using only the Command Line Interface?\nI took a snapshot of my MacOS system using Time Machine some time ago, and I'd like to restore just one file from it.\nAlso, I don't have GUI access to this box; only ssh (with root privilege).\nIs it possible to restore just one file from a Time Machine backup using the CLI over SSH? If so, how?\n\nA: You can browse to the files directly and restore them with the rsync command.\nDetermine path to Backups\nFirst, list all of your existing backups using tmutil listbackups\nuser@host ~ % tmutil listbackups\n/Volumes/externalBackups/Backups.backupdb/host/2020-06-17-095312\n/Volumes/externalBackups/Backups.backupdb/host/2020-06-18-222034\n/Volumes/externalBackups/Backups.backupdb/host/2020-06-21-110109\nuser@host ~ %\n\nEnter Backup Directory\nNext, cd into one of the above directories (the one from which you want to restore)\nuser@host ~ % cd /Volumes/externalBackups/Backups.backupdb/host/2020-06-21-110109\nuser@host 2020-06-21-110109 % \n\nEnter Backup's Data Directory\nThere should be a - Data directory with the data from this particular Time Machine backup.

For example, to restore the /private/etc/resolv.conf file to your system, you can now execute the following\nuser@host Untitled - Data % sudo rsync -av --progress private/etc/resolv.conf /private/etc/resolv.conf\n...\nuser@host Untitled - Data % \n\n\nA: Use tmutil restore\nAs a long time Unix fan I do love rsync.\nUsing the native rsync for this purpose, even in macOS Ventura 13.2, does have some downsides though:\n\n*\n\n*As suggested in a comment by\nhuyz, rsync\nisn't macOS aware. I have found that it won't copy any of the\nextended attributes of files that you use it to restore.\n\n*rsync isn't a Time Machine utility program that's Time Machine\naware, and seems unlikely to receive specific support from Apple\nfor the purpose of restoring files from Time Machine.\n\nAlternatively, use tmutil.\ntmutil is the Apple provided Time Machine command line utility supporting the restore action (since at least macOS 10.15):\ntmutil restore src ... dst\n\nThe manual page for tmutil for the restore action says:\n\nrestore [-v] src ... dst\nRestore the item src, which is inside a backup, to the location dst. The dst argument mimics the destination path semantics of the cp tool. You may provide multiple source paths to restore. The last path argument must be a destination.\nWhen using the restore verb, tmutil behaves largely like Finder. Custom Time Machine metadata (extended security and other) will be removed from the restored data, and other metadata will be preserved.\nRoot and Full Disk Access privileges may be required to perform restores. When restoring with tmutil as root, ownership of the restored items will match the state of the items in the backup.\n\nHere's an example of what this looks like. This is for a restore of the contents of my other Mac's (Other System) Downloads folder. And my shell is in the folder of that backup I wanted to restore from:\nDownloads $ tmutil restore * ~/Downloads \nTotal copied: 2273.96 MB (2384424593 bytes)\nItems copied: 76143\nDownloads $ pwd\n/Volumes/My Disk 1/Backups.backupdb/Other System/Latest/Macintosh HD - Data/Users/louis/Downloads\nDownloads $ ls -l@ manual.docx            \n-rw-r--r--@ 99 louis  staff  381577 Dec  5  2015 manual.docx\n    com.apple.finder.copy.source.checksum#N      4 \n    com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot      50 \n    com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot      50 \n    com.apple.metadata:kMDItemDownloadedDate        53 \n    com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms       218 \n    com.apple.quarantine        57 \nDownloads $ ls -l@ ~/Downloads/manual.docx            \n-rw-r--r--@ 1 louis  staff  381577 Dec  5  2015 /Users/louis/Downloads/manual.docx\n    com.apple.metadata:kMDItemDownloadedDate        53 \n    com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms       218 \n    com.apple.quarantine        57 \nDownloads $ tmutil compare manual.docx ~/Downloads/manual.docx \n\n-------------------------------------\nAdded:         0B\nRemoved:       0B\nChanged:       0B\nDownloads $\n\nThe command line src ... and dst arguments in this regard are just like what I'd use for rsync or cp. The difference being that using tmutil restore, all of the metadata for the files appear to be preserved with the exception of \"Time Machine metadata\" - which I take to be metadata that appears associated with the backup folder files but not with the original nor restored files. Thus the restored files and their metadata look to me to be exactly what they had been on the original computer from where they'd been backed up from.\n\nA: If you find a GUI easier to navigate, you should be able to use an FTP client (Transmit, Filezilla, Cyberduck, etc.) and connect to your Time Machine backup via sftp.\n", "Q: Normal for external SanDisk SSD 2T taking over 2 minutes to access files? Use not to So I have a MBP 16\" 2019 on Monterey 12.13.1 and using Sandisk external SSD drive partitioned Mac OS journaled and Windows ExFAT.  Up to now when mounting the drive all loaded pretty quickly, matter of seconds.  I last used the drive 4 days ago for a time machine backup.  When I plugged it in today to move some emails to it, the drive and both partitions showed in finder in about 3 seconds, but when I went to access the Mac partition it took over 2 minutes to load.\nI then ejected the drive and remounted - same - over 2 minutes to load the Mac part.\nHow can I tell why the access time has changed to be over 2 minutes?  Also I did First Aid on the Mac partition which took 10 minutes to complete.  Here are the results:\n\nHere is the drive info:\n\nThe only other odd behavior I notice  is that before today when ejecting the drive I would pick one partition and eject it then answer \"Yes\" to eject all drives question.

Its the Apple partition that takes a long time now for some reason...\nDiagnostic output\n\nA: Two minutes for a fsck isn’t abnormal, so the slow mount usually means the last eject wasn’t clean or the file system needs extra scrutiny. You can test this by running the check later by timing it.\nIf you feel everything else is normal, next thing I would check is what link speed was negotiated for that storage in system information. Open bout this Mac and select system information. Look up USB details for the device.\nChecking iops during the first aid might be worth the effort. Look at activity monitor for that disk.\nThird thing is I would measure the temperature of the drive (without the case if possible) via infrared tool.\n\nA: Such a long delay is usually an indication that the file system is getting checked for errors. That happens if the disk wasn't fully unmounted (ejected), leaving some data in a state that causes the check next time you mount it.\nYou may also be able to find some information about the check in the Console log (search for the name of your volume or for the command fsck_apfs.\n\nA: checking the drive for errors showed no issues and came back clean.  Apparently there was some sort of drive error as I move all the files to another drive and reformatted it and now all is back to as it was before the issue.\n", "Q: Is it possible to distribute a custom app from the Apple Business Manager via a direct link to users who do not have their own Apple Business Manager? We had an app previously distributed as an private app via the Apple Enterprise Developer Program.  This allowed us to put a direct link on an internal page allowing users to directly download the app to their device (similar to a side load on Android).  This was needed as some employee and contractor owned devices were not managed by an MDM.   This year Apple has asked us to use alternate mechanisms.\nOf the new mechanisms,  distributing the app through a Unlisted Direct link would have been the best option.  (https://developer.apple.com/support/unlisted-app-distribution). In our reading, the app would first be submitted as a public app and when approved, we would submit a request for a direct link.\nHowever, despite describing the intent in our app submission, the app review is stalled due to Guideline 3.2 below.\nHowever no guidance is provided for how to approach the mechanism described in https://developer.apple.com/support/unlisted-app-distribution.\nQ1: Anyone with any success with the Unlisted App Distribution mechanism?  Did we miss a step?  Should we have applied for an direct link ( https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/unlisted-app/ ) before submitting the App for review?\nAs a fall back strategy, we have activated an Apple Business Manager (ABM) account and are exploring distributing the app through that, but this appears to require that we enter the Apple Organization ID of all possible users.  Most of our agents will not have Apple Organization IDs which require a DUNS number etc to create.\nQ2: Is there a way to create a direct link for distribution from the Apple Business Manager mechanism that does not require the end user to have an Apple Business Manager account of their own?\n(Redemption codes are not an option.   We do offer authentication in our app, so are not that concerned with the link ending up with someone who is not allowed to use the app.   However, since this is an legacy app, we are not able to ask users to provide their apple ids and generate codes etc.)\nAny other suggestions for how to navigate this distribution issue?\n\n\nA: Q1 yes, idk, ask apple directly\nQ2 no\n\n*\n\n*Side loading requires an enterprise developer account and carries strict conditions and repercussions Apple will exercise if you don’t understand the legal agreement and terms of that program and get caught.\n\n*VPP is needed for all other ABM/ASM redemptions that go through the B2B process and not the App Store process.\n\nUnlisted apps work best for your use case if you can’t manage devices and AppleID with ABM/ASM consumers.

They used to work fine in April (6 weeks ago).\nLooking at errors in Console.app, I find these probably related messages:\nfault   13:49:45.008478 +0300   apsd    Failed entitlement check 'com.apple.private.secure-apsclient' for <private>\nfault   13:49:45.009632 +0300   apsd    Failed entitlement check 'com.apple.private.aps-connection-initiate' for <private>\n\nerror   13:49:45.359596 +0300   identityservicesd   ENGroupID initWithDataRepresentation - wrong data size -- Failed {data: (null)}\n\nerror   13:49:47.298499 +0300   cloudpaird  cloudpaird: sendResponderPairingMessage: Device info needed from CloudKit\n\nerror   13:49:47.459322 +0300   identityservicesd   ENGroupID initWithDataRepresentation - wrong data size -- Failed {data: (null)}\nfault   13:49:48.809973 +0300   identityservicesd   Dropping message! {guid: <private>, processError: (null), decryptionError <private>\n\nerror   13:49:50.853389 +0300   cloudd  TIC SSL Trust Error [113:0x7fce1c461350]: 3:0\nerror   13:49:50.853854 +0300   cloudd  Task <BD314808-6292-4966-8170-6963A206C3DC>.<7> HTTP load failed (error code: -1202 [3:-9807])\nerror   13:49:50.853975 +0300   cloudd  Task <BD314808-6292-4966-8170-6963A206C3DC>.<7> finished with error - code: -1202\nerror   13:49:50.856458 +0300   cloudd  NetworkingError, NSURLErrorDomain/-1202/NSUnderlyingError, kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork/-1202 CFStreamUnderlyingError _kCFStreamErrorDomainSSL/-9807\n\nOn the Mac where it's working, I see instead:\ndefault 14:06:19.167843 +0200   cloudd  TIC Enabling TLS [1476:0x7fc86511ae50]\ndefault 14:06:19.168069 +0200   cloudd  TIC TCP Conn Start [1476:0x7fc86511ae50]\n\nApparently, there is a general SSL authentication issue causing the troubles. But I cannot find out what's causing the SSL issue. Googling only finds a few indidents where developers run into the \"TIC SSL Trust Error\", but there it's suggested that their own SSL setup is wrong, over which they have control. But in my case it's Apple's server and client, so I am not directly involved in the chain of this connection.\nI've tried a few things blindly such as:\n\n*\n\n*Log out of iCloud, reboot, log in again.\n\n*Log in to a different account, as suggested in this answer.\n\n*Disable the Mac's Firewall (and Little Snitch, too).\n\n*Perform all system updates (such as latest Safari and Security updates).\n\n*Re-install macOS 10.13.6 over the current installation (via Recovery), as I wondered if some system file's code signatures or entitlements got lost.\n\n*Look at the Keychains, first deleting all expired Certificates, then even delete all manually trusted Certs (i.e. such that were previous untrusted and I manually changed that).\n\n*Log out of iCloud, log in to another Mac user account and log in to iCloud there (so that my normal user's Keychains can't be the culprit).\n\nNothing made a difference. The \"TIC SSL Trust Error\" keeps appearing in the log.\nAs I can log in to iCloud, SSL generally works. I can also access web sites with https without problems, including icloud.com.\niMessage (Messages.app) works fine, too.\nI wonder if there's a way to get more information about which part of the SSL cert trust chain is the issue here.\nAlso, is there a way to reset the entire Certificate system, perhaps, so that I can start with the bare minimum?\n\nA: While the situation isn’t identical, I ran into a similar issue that started happening with my two Macs running macOS 10.13.6 around the same time April.\nMy iPhone was syncing to iCloud, but nothing else. Messages worked on the High Sierra Macs, but wasn’t syncing conversations from iCloud or between machines. Likewise, syncing of Notes and iCloud Drive content on the two Macs was not happening.\nWhat tipped me off in Console.app were messages indicating that iCloud related connections to gateway.apple.com were failing due to an invalid certificate.\nThe certificate for this server is invalid. You might be connecting to a server that is pretending to be “gateway.icloud.com” which could put your confidential information at risk.\nLike you, I looked for expired certs in the Keychains on my primary Mac and discovered that AppleISTCA2G1.cer was indeed expired. I replaced it with a fresh certificate from Apple PKI and immediately iCloud sync started working again on that machine.\nOddly, that same expired certificate wasn’t even on the second Mac, but adding it to the Keychain fixed the syncing issues on that machine as well.\n\nA: You could try to use a proxy-server like Charles Proxy or similar  (Wireshark may do, too) to find out which hosts are tried to be reached (hosts are not hidden by TLS, only the Path). Then you can try to find out if any of these hosts have invalid certificates.\nIf TLS doesn't work on multiple old systems out of a sudden, i'd say some certificate expired.\n\nA: I managed to get the Mac working again by erasing the entire volume, then fresh-install High Sierra from the Recovery system (boot with cmd-R held down), and then restore all my data from a Time Machine backup I had made just before I started taking any of the steps listed in the question above. (BTW: After the initial install the desktop was unusable because the fonts were damaged somehow, to the point that I could not read any text. A reboot fixed that, though.)\nNow iCloud works again.\nThat still doesn't explain what went wrong, but at least I have a working iCloud again.\nI still have the other Mac showing the issue, because I had not done a fresh install on it, yet. I might instead try to compare the certificates in the keychains to see if I find the culprit there, but it's a low priority right now.\n", "Q: How to connect two monitors to M1 Mac Mini using a Thunderbolt Dock? I'm trying to find a solution to switching external monitors between an M1 Mac mini and an Intel MacBook Pro by replugging a single Thunderbolt cable.\nEquipment\n\n*\n\n*Two Dell U2720Q/U2720QM monitors (supports video signal from USB-C, HDMI & DisplayPort)\n\n*OWC Thunderbolt Hub\n\n*M1 Mac mini\n\n*2019 MacBook Pro 16\"\nConnections\n\n*\n\n*Monitor 1 is connected to the OWC Hub with a Thunderbolt 3 cable.\n\n*Monitor 2 is connected to the OWC Hub with a USB-C cable (cable came with the monitor).\n\n*Monitor 2 is connected to M1 Mac mini with an HDMI cable (cable came with the monitor).\n\nProblem\nWhen I plug the M1 Mac Mini to the OWC Hub with a Thunderbolt 4 cable (came with the Hub), macOS recognizes two external displays but route both HDMI and DisplayPort over USB-C signals to the same display - Monitor 2. Switching inputs on Monitor 2 shows the different macOS spaces of the same machine (the M1 Mac Mini). If I unplug the USB-C cable going to the Monitor 2 from the Hub, macOS reconfigures itself to route DisplayPort over USB-C to Monitor 1 and HDMI to Monitor 2 (this is the desired state). Plugging USB-C cable going to Monitor 2 back to the OWC Hub after that doesn't change the layout. When the MacBook Pro is plugged into the OWC Hub instead of the M1 Mac Mini, everything works as expected - the system recognizes and uses both monitors as external displays.\nQuestion\nHow can I configure macOS to always route DisplayPort over USB-C to Monitor 1 and HDMI to Monitor 2?\n\nA: You can't do it with the particular Thunderbolt hub you have. You need one with DisplayLink support for M1 based Mac. The Sonnet DisplayLink Dual DisplayPort Adapter works. (Alternatively, your current hub and displays will work with a M1Pro/Max/Ultra based machines.)\n", "Q: How can I create a shortcut to toggle javascript on/off in mobile Safari on my iPhone?

I have an old USB connected SSD that I have been using as a Time Machine target on a Mac running macOS 12 (Monterey). This old drive was setup on this Mac under Monterey so it was formatted APFS from the get-go.\nRecently I purchased a new SSD which will also be connected via USB. I would like to copy the entire contents of the old SSD to the new SSD and then start to use the new SSD as a Time Machine target. The old SSD would then be repurposed. Is this possible?\n\nA: It’s possible, but usually not practical.\nOpen Disk Utility and restore from the old drive to the new drive. This makes a block by block copy of the data so that hard linked files are copied once. Monterey uses APFS by default, so it will be interesting if any of the snapshots copy.\nI don't recommend this at all and would encourage you to set up the new drive as a second destination and then put the old drive on the shelf or just erase it when the new destination has enough history to be safe to discard. However, there's no harm in doing this if you are certain you don't erase / restore the empty drive to the one that's full by reversing the selection.\nTo perform a bulk copy - open Disk Utility:\n\n*\n\n*Select the drive that's new on the left sidebar\n\n*Select Restore at the top of the main window\n\n*Select the Backup drive on the left sidebar\n\n\nThe restore is TO the first selected volume FROM the one you select second.\n\nA: I think I had success with Roadkil's Raw Copy launched from Hiren's Boot USB\nI did this on an old windows laptop.\nMessed it up by cloning the wrong drive though... Both were in APFS so it was impossible to know which one is which (because they were not recognised). The new drive had one backup and it was cloned successfully. (when connected to the old drive it was recognised as the new one and had one backup which I could browse)\nIf someone does this in the future I would recommend formatting the new drive to NTFS or FAT, so you can clearly see which drive is which!\n", "Q: Setting Bitrate for Serial-Over-USB Device to 256000 I need to communicate with a serial-over-USB device which requires a bitrate of 256000 but macOS 11.6.7 (x86) and 12.4 (M1) are refusing to do that.\n# stty -f /dev/tty.usbserial-141130 256000\nstty: tcsetattr: Invalid argument\n\nThe device in question is using a Prolific PL2303 chipset. Is there a way to get macOS to use the bitrate I need, maybe with custom drivers?\n\nA: The common drivers for the PL2303 chipset all have a maximum baud rate setting of 230400.\nThe PL2303 chipset in some variants itself does support higher baudrates, but the rest of the hardware (i.e. your \"serial over USB device\") and the cabling needs to support it as well. 256000 is not a common baud rate, so you usually won't see much support for it.\nYou did not include any details about the device you're trying to communicate with. Most often those devices come with baud rate settings that allow you to use other baud rates - I suggest that you find out if that is possible for your device, and then set a lower baud rate.\nIf that doesn't work, you can make your own driver for the PL2303 chipset - or try to modify one of the open source drivers.\nAn easier way forward would probably be to run a Linux virtual machine on your Mac and setup the communication in there.\nNote however that on Linux again only certains variants of the PL2303 chip supports setting a 2560000 baud rate. For example the PL2303HXN chip supports a 256000 baud rate, but the PL2303HX does not. There are more than 10 variants.\nThose variants that do not support the 256000 baud rate can instead be set to 230400 baud. That is the common baud rate nearest 256000 baud.\nUPDATE\nIn the comments, you have now detailed that the device is an m2m Blue-450. This device contains a (now End-of-Lifed) BLE121LR Bluetooth LE module, which has an UART interface - and a Prolific PL2303HXD (also End-of-Lifed) for bridging that to USB.\nThe documentation for the BLE121LR lists 230400 as a common baud rate to use with it - they do not mention 256000 at all. The module allows for changing the baud rate through its configuration.\nUnfortunately the documentation for the m2m Blue-450 is a bit unclear on configuration options. They list that 256000 baud is (very unfortunate) standard setting, they have chosen. The wording seems to imply that this is just a standard, and thus that you might be able to change it. I have only found the documentation in German though, and my German is a bit rusty.\nAnother thing they detail in the documentation is that only Windows 7 and Linux is supported. I assume this means that they are aware that other systems are not supported. You might want to contact their support to enquire whether they have a solution now for the Mac.\nProlific hosts a macOS driver for the chip on their web site here:\nhttps://www.prolific.com.tw/UserFiles/files/PL2303HXD_G_Mac%20Driver_v2_1_0_20210311.zip\nYou might want to try it to see if they have made it possible to use 256000 baud.\nI have checked the open-source driver as well as the commercial mac-usb-serial.com driver for the PL2303 - they do not support 256000 baud.\nFor the open-source driver I have found that they write in the documentation that it does only supports up to 230400 baud, but in the source code, it does seem that 256000 would be supported - if the chipset in the device supports it. So you might want to have a go with the open-source driver to see if that works.\nI would suggest these five options for trying to get the device to work on your Mac in order of priority:\n\n*\n\n*Try the driver from Prolific.\n\n\n*Try the open-source driver for old macOS versions, if you're running one of those.\n\n\n*You have the device working on Windows. Use that and see if you have direct access to the BLE121LR module over the connection. If that is the case, you could be able to use the configuration commands listed in this document to set a different baud rate (for use with macOS).\n\n\n*Boot Linux in a virtual machine on your Mac and access the device from there.\n\n\n*Create your own driver based on the open-source driver. This is easiest if you're not running a recent macOS version - which I assume you're not, as you're using relatively old hardware and recent Macs have Bluetooth LE built-in. The change is relatively simple (if you happen to be a programmer ofcourse), as we have the Linux driver source code to compare with - and the baud rate configuration logic is not complex.\n", "Q: Mountpoint of network shares Where exactly are network shares, more specifically samba shares located in the file system tree?

Because Pages keeps a list of the last 6 fonts you used, you can't just click on the font drop-down and press \"down\".  You'd have to do it at least 6 times, then \"n+1\" every single time afterward, and Automator doesn't let me edit the results of recording UI actions.\n\n\nA: You can realize your goal without writing any code line - the Font Book allows you this,\njust proceed as follows:\n\n*\n\n*In your Font Book, click on the + sign in the lower left corner, and add a new\nfont collection - and from All Fonts list, just drag a specific font and drop\nit to the new collection.

If I have auto brightness on, I noticed that if I manually adjusted the brightness, it will never go back to auto again.\nDoes it go back to auto again, only under certain conditions?\nOnly after a certain period of time?\nAnd does it have an \"internal\" value that it goes to for a given ambient light level?\nOr does it \"auto\" adjust based on the value you set and use that as a baseline?\n\nA: There's no documentation on this, so the following is based on observation:\nIn auto mode, data from the ambient light sensor is used to automatically brighten or dim the display brightness. In manual mode, the ambient light sensor data isn't used; default display brightness is as you set manually.\nWhen set to auto but you adjust the brightness manually, it stays at that level until you change it. However, auto mode is still on, so if the sensor detects a change in the illumination level, it adjusts the brightness (e.g. if you cover the sensor, the screen becomes darker. If you shine a light on the sensor, the screen becomes brighter). When the illumination level returns to normal, the brightness returns to what you had set manually.\n", "Q: How to escape mouse selection in Terminal.App I am using a mouse enabled application in the terminal but now I want to copy some text. By this I mean, I want to select text in the terminal with the mouse and copy it with Command+C to copy it to a different program.\nHowever, selecting does not work because the application captures the mouse and does other things. So, e.g. dragging in vim will select text in vim but then Command+C does not work for copying.\nOn other systems this can often be fixed by holding shift. Is there a similar thing for Terminal.App?\n\nA: I just found a hint in a different question that Command+R turns off mouse support.

Specifically, I would like the encrypted image to be under user1's Documents directory but allowing user2 to open and modify it.\nI know that MacOS is a Unix variant.  In Linux/Unix I would create a group and add the two users belong that group and make the shared files rw-accessible by that group.  I can do this from the command line.  Is this the best approach on Mac as well?  I was looking for clues under the \"Users & Groups\" setting under \"System Preferences\" but I couldn't understand it.  There are groups in there that I don't see in /etc/group.\n\nA: The preferred way, in macOS, to share files is to create a directory in /Users/Shared and place the files in that directory. And, of course, give that directory and the enclosed files (in this case an encrypted image) the permissions you require to give the two users r/w access.\nWhilst you can give user2 access to files in user1's home folder, this can get messy as default permissions do not, for example, allow world read of \"Documents\" folder.  Further, these folders are subject to special privacy protection rules in addition to regular file permissions.  So do use /Users/Shared.\nYou also need to consider the permissions of file and folders inside the encrypted image. Since the two users are the only ones with access to the image and, presumably, know the encryption password, the easiest way to manage these permissions is to ignore permissions on the volume.\nAll of these changes can be made in Finder's Get Info (Command-I) windows. But if you really want or need to set POSIX permissions at the command line, have at it.\nThe GUI way to create and manage groups is to use \"Users & Groups\" setting under \"System Preferences\".\nCreate the group using the + at bottom left (after unlocking with your administrator password). Give the group a name and add members.\nTwo points:\n\n*\n\n*Ignore what is in /etc/group, except to avoid duplicating any name with your new group.\n\n*Do not use standard Linux commands to manage groups and users.\n\nThe new group can then be used with folder and file permission using Finder's Get Info (Command-I).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro failed the OS update, and now disks are unavailable My 2010 MacBook Pro that has been functioning without issues before failed a High Sierra update today, and then started showing a blinking folder icon, which indicated that it was not able to locate a startup.

If I go to Reinstall MacOS, it's unable to locate any disks for the install.  Disk Utility is not showing anything except of \"OS X Base System\" and its parent \"Apple Disk Image Media\".  If I run \"diskutil list\" in Terminal, I get a bunch of little disks that have nothing to do with the main one.\nDoes it mean that the update failed my hard drive completely?  Is there a way to restore data files from it if I get a new MacBook?\n\nA: That is an older MacBook and while some Macs do last quite a while (I have a working SE/30 in my office...) it could be that the drive just failed and it was coincidental with the OS update you were applying.\nIf Disk Utility does not show the drive in Recovery Mode that would point to the SSD itself having (possibly) failed. Yes it could be another component or even the system board or connectors, cables, etc that connects to the SSD. But the logical first step would be to try that SSD in an external case on another Mac. If it is still not working then I would replace the SSD.\nifixit.com is a good source for instructions, tools and links to replacement drives. I have no relation or interest in the company, other than they provide an excellent resource.\nNote that while it SOUNDS like a possible SSD failure, diagnosing hardware via web forum can only give you possibilities you can try. Depending on your needs it may be better to just get a new(er) Mac or have a trained Apple repair person have a look at it.\nThat is if you don't feel qualified to do this work yourself.

The issue I am facing is that it seems I cannot pair any non-Apple external device to my computer.\nIn particular, I tried with:\n\n*\n\n*JBL wireless headphones, supposed to connect via bluetooth (on my iPhone I could connect via bluetooth)\n\n*An external drive from Verbatim, connected via USB-c port\n\nI believe it has something to do with my Mac not allowing external providers to connect? I guess some change is needed from settings side?\nI would appreciate any suggestion on this.\nMany thanks in advance!\n\nA: The underlying assumption in your question is that Macs somehow do things differently for Apple devices as compared to non-Apple devices. That's not the case.\nThere's no setting to \"allow external providers\", simply because there's nothing in macOS that will \"block\" or \"not allow\" products from other vendors.\nIn particular, USB-C storage drives from any manufacturer should work well on the Mac, and Bluetooth headphones from any manufacturer should also work well on the Mac.\nRegarding your Bluetooth headphones: Find the manual for the headphones and find out how to make them enter pairing mode. Usually this is done by holding one or more buttons on the head phones until an LED is blinking. Then open System Preferences > Bluetooth on your Mac and hopefully the device should appear in the list for you to connect with.\nRegarding your external storage device not pairing. There's no pairing process for external storage devices. If you plug the device in it should automatically do the right thing. If you do not see a volume appear in Finder, it is must probably because the disk format is not supported by macOS.\nYou can open the app Disk Utility (comes with the Mac) to see all the volumes on your external disk. It will also allow you to reformat your external disk into a format that is supported by macOS - such as for example APFS (most commonly when only using the disk with Macs) or ExFAT (most commonly when sharing the disk between Mac and Windows systems).\nNote that reformatting your disk means that the data stored on the disk is lost.\nIf you rather keep the format already there, you can install install third party file system drivers for some other types of file systems.\n", "Q: Connect Logitech Z906 5.1 to MacBook Pro 2018 How do I connect the Logitech Z906 5.1 speaker system to my MacBook Pro (2018, ports: 4 usb-type c, 1 3.5mm headphone jack) to get full surround sound / best quality sounding music?\nWill it just connect into the headphone jack?\n\nA: This is always a 'fun' task…\nYou need to be able to go from USB to S/PDIF, then you can connect the S/PDIF output to the Logitech input. The Logitech will then be responsible for 5.1 decoding.\nIf you try to just run from the headphone jack, you'll only get 2.0 stereo.\nThe 'fun' part comes when you try to search Amazon or eBay etc for a 'USB 5.1 DAC' - you get a thousand options, none of which will actually do what you want them to. They will either want S/PDIF in, which modern Macs cannot do,  they use USB for power but not as a device connection, etc. This makes the search pretty difficult, even for an audio pro.\nSo, to cut to the chase, these two will do what you need.

Both on the same LAN. I'd like to connect from the Linux computer to the Mac and work on the Mac using my two displays, mouse, and keyboard connected to the Linux computer. I don't need (and prefer not to) the MacBook's screen to display anything, I'd like to keep the laptop closed and use it basically as a headless server.\nI've searched many questions here and on other portals, all come down to screen sharing (VNC) which is not the functionality I'm looking for: the Mac has a different resolution and different number of displays, obviously.\nI'm looking for a functionality similar to Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDP) which I use to connect from the Linux machine to the Windows machine I currently have:\n#! /bin/bash\nPCPASS=$(zenity --entry --hide-text --title=\"PC Password\" --text=\"Enter the Password\")\nxfreerdp \\\n/v:192.168.64.38 \\\n/u:myname \\\n/p:$PCPASS \\\n/d:server-s.domain.com \\\n/f /monitors:0,1 \\\n/multimon \\\n+fonts +window-drag +clipboard \\\n/audio-mode:1\n\nI am aware similar questions have been asked many times, I've tried using TigerVNC and KRDC but all do the same thing – just mirror what I see on the Mac's display to the window of the VNC client I'm running on my Linux machine. Is there anything I can use to basically forward the graphical interface of the Mac to my Linux machine, the same way RDP does it with Windows servers (computers)?\n\nA: I'm assuming you want the question answered for \"standard\" macOS applications, and not only for a very specific subset such as only X11-based software:\nBuilt-in Support\nThe only remote control server built-in to macOS is based on the VNC protocol - essentially transferring a graphical image to the client (i.e. as opposed to for example X11, where it is possible to transfer mere \"descriptions\" instead of their bitmapped outcomes).\nHowever, the built-in server is not limited to \"mirroring\" as you seem to indicate. For example, with the Apple Remote Desktop client, you can enable something named \"Curtain Mode\". Essentially this lets the display on the server only show a message stating that the computer is locked, while the remote client is able to interact with the user interface.\nThe built-in server does support a dual monitor setup, so it is possible to remote control built monitors on a Mac with two monitors. However, I do not believe it is possible to configure such a setup \"virtually\" (i.e. with hardware).\nOne way of solving your use case of a head-less Mac server with dual-displays is to buy dummy HDMI dongles that mimic a connected display. Add two of these to the laptop so that you see 3 displays in your System Preferences. Connect the laptop to a charger, so that it doesn't go to sleep, and you should be able to close it up and have it still be running with 2 \"virtual\" displays while the internal display is turned off. Connecting to it remotely via VNC will allow you to control applications on those two \"displays\".\nThird Party Solutions\nIf you look at third party solutions, it is indeed possible to run an RDP server on macOS:\nAn open source solution like Xrdp is probably not what you want, as it doesn't allow for remotely controlling ordinary macOS applications.\nAn alternative is available from NuoRDS with their NuoRDS Terminal server which add an RDP server to macOS. They support macOS 10.12 and later (including macOS 12 Monterey), and allow a non-mirrored mode. For example they allow multiple users to connect to the same remote Mac at the same time while working with different applications. However, as far as I see, they do not describe in their documentation whether you can have 2 virtual displays on the remote Mac.\nAnother alternative is to look at products from Aqua Connect. Their Ignision Server adds an RDP server to macOS. They also have a Terminal Server product that works for macOS 10.9 and older (i.e. recent versions of macOS are not supported). Unfortunately it looks like there hasn't been any real development on the software for a number of years, so it might not work at all on recent macOS. They do list being able to work in a non-mirrored mode, but they do not specifically address being able to use more displays than the remote computer has.\nI do not use the NuoRDS or Aqua Connect solutions myself, so I cannot check whether the specific function of having 2 virtual displays on the remote Mac is supported. I would advise contacting their customer support for clarification before buying a license.\n", "Q: rotated K in return key my apple laptop features a rotated K symbol in the return key.\nI know it's supposed to be used with the fn key in combination with the return key.

I'm running MacOS 11.6.6, and I want to do something that is probably impossible on a Mac running that OS version (and possibly all versions). However, just in case I am overlooking something, I thought I would ask here, just in case there's a way, after all, for me to implement what I want. Hope springs eternal!\nI know that I can run XQuartz to get an X Server running on my Mac, and then, I know how to set up an ssh-managed connection between my Linux box and my Mac in order to get an X-based utility that is initiated on the Mac under XQuartz (for example, the xterm program) to have its application window appear on my Linux box, even though the xterm program itself is running on my Mac.\nWhat I am trying to do is something similar, but for a non-XQuartz-based program running on my Mac to have its application window show up on my Linux box. I know I can use something like VNC, NoMachine, AnyDesk, etc. to share the entire Mac desktop with my Linux box. However, I just want one (and only one!) Mac application window to show up on the Linux box, not my entire Mac desktop.\nFor example, suppose I am running the Chrome browser on my Mac. It does not have an X-Windows-based version that runs under XQuartz. I would like to somehow cause the application window for this Mac-resident Chrome browser to somehow show up on my Linux box ... and again, I do not want the entire Mac desktop to show up.\nAre there any tricks or hacks or perhaps 3rd-party utilities which would allow me to do such a thing?\nAs I mentioned, I think that what I want to do is probably impossible ... but could I be mistaken about that impossibility?\nThank you in advance.\nUPDATE: I had forgotten to mention that I want to continue to be able to use my Mac for other applications while the one application is redirected to my Linux box. This means that I can't have that one application take up the entire screen and then just share the desktop via VNC, AnyDesk, NoMachine, etc.\nAnd ideally, I'd like it to work the way a remotely displayed X application works: where its window does not show up at all on the host it's running on, and instead, the window shows up on the remote host via the remote host's X server.\nBased on the replies I have received, I am even more convinced now that what I want is almost certainly impossible. But maybe ... maybe ... perhaps via some esoteric, not-widely-known hack, there might be a way to accomplish this. Like I said above, hope springs eternal!\nAnd now I stand corrected about the use of XQuartz. I understand now that I don't need that to be running on the Mac side in order to use X forwarding via ssh in order to get X-based apps on the Mac to display their windows remotely. Thanks again to @nohillside for setting me straight about this fact.\n\nA: Finding a solution that will enable this without leaving the slighest hint on the main display that remote sharing is enabled - that is going to be very difficult, if not impossible.\nYou might in theory be able to pull something off by using a dummy HDMI dongle, so that macOS handles an extra \"virtual\" display, that can be used for the applications to be remoted. However, it will still be detectable on the main display that there's such an extra \"virtual\" display in play.\nBut one thing is theory, another thing is a practical implementation. I think there's a few options out there that you could potentially look at, but I don't think there's any \"press one button and it works\" programs available at the moment.\nOne option is called \"SharedAppVnc\":\nhttp://shared-app-vnc.sourceforge.net/\nThis is similar to the VNC option you know, but instead of sharing the entire desktop, it shares only a single (or multiple) windows. The good news is that it is open-source, but the bad news is that it seemingly hasn't been updated for several years.\nAnother option is \"TightVNC Server\". The TightVNC server for Windows has options \"-shareapp\" and \"-sharewindow\" to share only a specific app or a specific window. They have a macOS version of the server - it is a commercial product. I don't know if that version supports the same options, but it could be worth contact their support to ask.\nhttps://www.tightvnc.com/licensing-server-macos.php\nA final option is \"Window Switch\". It uses xpra and other tools in order to display application windows that are actually running on other computers. They have screenshots showing Linux application windows being shown on macOS, but not the other way around - it does seem from the documentation that it should be possible, but there's no specific screenshot of it.\nhttp://winswitch.org/about/\n", "Q: Old user info keeps coming back on M1 MacBook Air I bought my M1 MacBook Air, second hand, and not only the host name keeps coming back after several factory resets (one of them erasing the partition), but also, an old email, that I don't recognize keeps coming back to settings --> user accounts.\nI have to delete this old email, and rename \"hostname\", every time I factory reset may Mac.

The idea is this: Have a dedicated Mac for building the ports. This Mac has HomeBrew, or MacPorts, or Fink installed. Compile a port on this Mac, and produce a binary package that can be distributed to other Macs (of the same architecture). The distributed binary should function on the target Mac without HomeBrew, or MacPorts, or Fink ever being present.\nFor clarification: when I say \"produce a binary package\", I don't really care about the type of that \"package\". It does not need to be a proper PKG. I am happy with a tgz or zip archive as well, as long as it contains everything delivered for the right directories for the tool to work fine (including config file, sample, man, libs, etc) and nothing more. Sources and headers are not needed to run the tool, so those should be exluded from the package if possible.\nManually assembling all the necessary files for such a package is something I would not attempt. So I wonder if there is a recipe in any of HomeBrew/MacPorts/Fink to do something like this.\nTake Midnight Commander as an example. The goal is to build it on one computer, then distribute and use on many target Macs. However, those target Macs would not have HomeBrew/MacPorts/Fink, nor Xcode or gcc. Those are just regular Macs with macOS installed, nothing else. But I would like to run my build of Midnight Commander on all of them. A week or so later I may also want to add MariaDB, or any other tool that can be built from source using HomeBrew/MacPorts/Fink. Again, I would build it on one Mac, but intend to run it on many other.\nThe target Macs are managed computers. Their users are just that, users. Tools required would be built from source on the dedicated Mac, and provided as binary for the target Macs. Yes, I could install MacPorts or HomeBrew on those Macs too and compile what is needed, in place. But I hope this can be avoided. If I remember correctly, MacPorts offers something like \"make package\" or \"make pkg\". Which is what gave me the idea to investigate this possibility further.\nAny pointers or suggestions are welcome.\n\nSupplemental: I found the below documentation very useful. If you can point me to similar readings, please do so. Particularly if that covers a similar function in HomeBrew or Fink.\nMacPorts howto - CreateInstallers\nInstructions on github\nThe focus is NOT on how to create a package. The focus is on WHAT files go into the package.\n\nA: Sure, there are tons of tools for packaging files on macOS and you could choose the one that matches your specific pain points.\nThe best writing I’ve seen on this from a “how to package” standpoint is\n\n*\n\n*https://books.apple.com/us/book/packaging-for-apple-administrators/id1173928620\nUnless you have a large fleet of machines to manage, MDM and tools for orchestrating the scoping / staging / installation and patching may be overkill.

I frequently get spam messages sent to my iPhone messenger from email addresses. I have no idea how that is even possible. Regardless, these are always spam, and I would love to be able to block them all. Is there a way to do this?\n\n\nA: In Settings → Messages, under Message Filtering you can enable ‘Filter Unknown Senders’ which will keep them in a separate list you can switch to in Messages, sort of like a spam folder in email.\n\nA: Contact your cellular carrier to block their email to SMS gateway. I don’t think any integrate this feature into iOS but perhaps their app for managing your account lets you DIY based on which carrier you have.\nYou could also try this trick of adding zero numbers to your personal blocked contact list.\n", "Q: Segregate user home folders when both users are members of `staff` group I want to segregate two home folders, /Users/justin and /Users/anotherUser such that one user cannot view the contents of the other.\nMy first attempt was to change the permissions of group everyone for /Users/justin from \"Read only\" (default) to \"No Access\", and similarly for \"anotherUser\".\n\nBut \"anotherUser\" can still read the contents of /Users/justin. I think this is because both users are members of the staff group.\n➜  /Users ls -l\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxrwt  15 root     wheel   480  2 May 09:51 Shared\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 14 altuser  staff   448 20 Jun 13:24 altuser\ndrwxr-x---@ 86 justin   staff  2752 20 Jun 17:56 justin\n\nMy understanding is that by default, macOS assigns all users to staff.\nHow can I segregate the two home folders without removing them from staff? Or is it safe to remove them from staff?\n\nA: You can remove read access for staff from the home directory by setting it to \"No Access\" in the Sharing & Permission box (your first screenshot) removing the staff entry (or by running sudo chmod 700 justin altuser in Terminal).\nPS: This assumes that neither user is an admin user (because admin users can obviously change it back easily).\n\nA: By default, almost all the top-level contents of a user folder should already be set this way - they have no group, only owner & everyone. Owner is r/w, everyone is no access.\n\n\n\nJust remove the group entirely to restore to defaults.\n\nOf course, as already mentioned - any other admin can undo this. You have no powers as admin that don't also belong to every other admin.\n", "Q: Macbook Battery Calibration. Cell Voltages not the same, One cell is likely depleted and the other two are full I have a 2017 MacBook Pro 15 with a fairly new battery. One day it just suddenly switched off with 80% battery remaining and when I switched it on (or tried to) it said the battery was empty.\nSince then the MacBook switches off randomly while reporting a full state of charge and when I do plug it in to charge it, it charges from 0% to 5% - 15% then it jumps to 100% all in about less than 15 minutes.\nI found this command ioreg -l -w0 | grep Capacity and it showed me something interesting. Apparently, the battery is made up of three cells each at about 4.35V when fully charged... the peculiar thing is that the reported voltages of one cell differs from the rest. eg... (4216mV, 3521mV, 4210mV). The MacBook usually switches off when the faulty cell has less than 2800mV. (When on low power mode and screen brightness at minimum)\nSo I figured the reason my MacBook swithes off while it reports > 80% battery is because one of the cells is way more depleted than the rest, then when the battery voltage drops below the minimum (I think around 11.2V) to run to electronics then it switches of\nhere's a sample output of ioreg -l -w0 | grep Capacity\n└─[$] ioreg -l -w0 | grep Capacity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 [17:18:58]\n| |           \"AppleRawCurrentCapacity\" = 6971\n| |           \"AppleRawMaxCapacity\" = 7128\n| |           \"MaxCapacity\" = 7128\n| |           \"CurrentCapacity\" = 6971\n| |           \"LegacyBatteryInfo\" = {\"Amperage\"=18446744073709550486,\"Flags\"=4,\"Capacity\"=7128,\"Current\"=6971,\"Voltage\"=11713,\"Cycle Count\"=12}\n| |           \"BatteryData\" = {\"LifetimeData\"={\"TotalOperatingTime\"=28160,\"UpdateTime\"=1655739345,\"AverageTemperature\"=273,\"Raw\"=<0000000000483ff4000108f100000000060ae9c40080e467b24000000000000001d9004e1106084b33091fc6155be5271a8ce074eadce8ac01110006e0070031>,\"TimeAtHighSoc\"=<00000000230500001200000000000000>},\"Serial\"=\"C01514309YEF90MA4\",\"ChemID\"=3165,\"Flags\"=192,\"DataFlashWriteCount\"=0,\"PassedCharge\"=18446744073709550538,\"Voltage\"=11798,\"ResScale\"=167,\"RaTableRaw\"=(<0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000>,<0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000>,<0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000>),\"StateOfCharge\"=98,\"Qmax\"=(6580,6600,6590),\"CycleCount\"=12,\"DesignCapacity\"=6600,\"SystemPower\"=1497,\"AdapterPower\"=0,\"PMUConfigured\"=192,\"DOD0\"=(9280,9344,9248),\"PresentDOD\"=(40,41,40),\"CellVoltage\"=(4214,3276,4223)}\n\nAs you can see the battery is quite new (cycle count = 12) and the faulty cell, \"CellVoltage\"=(4214,3276,4223)\nCan any please help me fix this issue?

I'm hoping to get a software solution as first preference, or I can right my own code to manage the charging if software like that doesn't exist and my last option is to open up the MacBook and manually discharge the other two cells which I don't think is a good idea... Or maybe I have made the wrong diagnosis and there's a different solution to my problem.\nI have tried reset ing the SMB and NVRAM with no luck.\n\nA: After doing some reading, I think the mostly cause is that it was shipped to me with a low state of charge and it took 11 days to arrive. When it it arrived I had to leave it plugged in for about 5 minutes before it switched on.\nThe battery seems to be genuine (Manufacturer is SMP).\nSo looks like I just have to get it replaced. A friend bought it for me in USA and had it shipped to South Africa.\nNow I know that it is very important to make sure devices with batteries should be at 50% charge if left unused for more than a couple of days.\n", "Q: Can't click to allow giving permissions For many apps, I can't give them permissions.

Once I log back in, launch Steam, and try to play the game again, it runs perfectly. I found this question describing something similar. So, I checked in /Library/Logs and found that the last two times it logged me out, files like this were created: \"WindowServer_2022-06-21-012452_thom-blair-iiis-computer-2.crash\". Here is the content of that file.

One thing about Open GL is it doesn't play nice with anything it has to share memory with. One common symptom of this is it logs out the current user, though it doesn't seem to hard crash the Mac.\nMake sure you're not running anything else that uses the GPU in the same way - Photoshop & other things Adobe especially.

Is there a way to open the context menu (a.k.a. \"the right click menu\") at the text cursor, using the keyboard when typing in a text field in OSx? If not in general, at least for Google Chrome?\nThe background for this is that as a developer, I've become used to using Alt+Enter to open context menus at the text cursor, for example to fix some common mistakes.\nNow when I was filling out a form in Google Chrome, I realised just how utterly backwards it is to have to switch from keyboard to trackpad and move the mouse over to a misspelled word, right click, move the mouse again and finally left click just to fix a spelling mistake.\nThis seems like one of those features that should have been there from day 1 when spell checking was introduced, but at the same time I haven't been able to find any clear info on how to do it, so I wouldn't be surprised if it can't be done either.\n\n\nA: I got right to the end before realising that the cussed anti-Apple Google Chrome cannot do a lot of this [even the ones that are actually in the menu don't work]. I'm leaving the answer here for anyone who uses Safari.\nThe Mac has always been mouse-driven. It was the philosophy right from the start. It's changed somewhat over the years, key commands can now be linked to just about anything - but there's never been adoption of any structure to open the right click menu that doesn't involve a click. [Ctrl/click was added several years ago as the rise of laptops seemed to make actual right clicking less popular.]\nPerhaps you could use Karabiner-Elements to generate the right/ctrl click. It's not an app I've ever used, but seems to be a common solution for any kind of key substitution.\nAlternatives I can think of…\n\n*\n\n* Cmd ⌘   ;  [Edit menu > Spelling & Grammar > Check Document now] will rapidly step through misspelled words. It might be faster to do this, then just retype the word correctly.\n\n\n*Switch on Correct Spelling Automatically [Also in Edit menu > Spelling & Grammar >].\nThe downside of these methods is you will have to spend some time teaching it words it doesn't know. You only have to do this once per word, but it's an ongoing task - and you have to watch out for it making wrong guesses with 'Automatic' on.\nBoth of these methods are common to most apps. Some apps may require individual switching.\n\nUnfortunately,  Chrome, which usually manages to avoid using proper Mac toolbox structures, doesn't have these options.

Currently I've figured out that with working mac, I can mount my drive and move files. However that broken mac mini was my only mac. So if possible, I want to restore data on windows/linux(maybe hackintosh if possible)\nIs there any tools for it? or should I find my friend to borrow mac for a day?\n\nA: Physically, a fusion drive is two separate devices, an SSD & an HD. macOS 'bonds' these together in software to become a Fusion Drive. The HD contains all* your data, the SSD contains a small subset of the most-used data, for faster retrieval.\nAs far as Windows is concerned, what you have is a small SSD & a large HD. It has no idea of the concept of 'fusion'.\nIf you connect the HD to a PC, then you will be able to mount it in Windows if you have 'translation' software, such as Paragon's HFS+ for Windows. Without the software, the disk will be completely unreadable & your PC will ask to format it. Don't do this.\nYou could, of course, mount it on any other Mac without the need for this software.\n*There may be some slight discrepancy of the data content of the two drives if the Mac had failed in the middle of a write/flush cache, but you would still have most of it intact.\n", "Q: How to toggle microphone off/on? On macos (Monterey/version 12) how can I toggle the microphone off/on (mute/unmute)? If there's no control for this, is there a way to script it for macos specifically to achieve the desired effect of quickly toggling the microphone?\nVarious apps use the microphone (eg web/webrtc calling, desktop calling/meeting apps, etc) and don't actually mute when I select that option, they simply turn off the audio stream. How can I control my own microphone from the OS instead of the various oddities and quirks of app developers (regardless of whether it's in browser or otherwise)?\nThanks.\n\nA: The Sound preferences control panel provides the control for muting and adjusting the microphone in the [Input] tab. When adjusting the volume slider to the far left/down it results in the calling apps warning me my microphone is muted, as expected.\nFor convenience I searched in the App Store for \"mute mic\" and found MuteKey which when open allows toggling the microphone off and on (and has settings for opening on login).\nRelated to this a scripted solution is mentioned in Saaru's comment above which is super helpful and I might try as well.

What worked for me was doing a rebuild of the inbox (or the affected folder). You can find the option in the Mail app's \"Mailbox\" menu:\n\n\nA: As requested, here is the long document I pulled together and saved should this problem arise again with any of the seniors I help:\nEmail troubleshooting steps\nIf Mail is repeatedly quitting unexpectedly:\nList of possible solutions: simplest to most complex.\n[Apple’s comprehensive Troubleshoot Email Problems In Mail on Mac can be found here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mail/troubleshooting-mail35552/mac]\n\n*\n\n*Are you running AV?  - Try completely uninstalling any fully interactive anti-virus software that you have installed. (This will likely require the developer's uninstaller to uninstall it completely.) Modern anti-virus software integrates with your e-mail program, and sometimes the two will interact badly.\n\n\n*A common Mail problem is receiving a corrupted/malicious e-mail that causes Mail to choke and crash. The way to deal with that is to log into your ISP's mail server using the Web-based interface most ISP's provide and to delete the problematic e-mail manually. The problematic one is usually easy to spot. It's usually either spammy or unreadable.\n\n\n*With the Apple Mail Application closed, hold the SHIFT  key & open Mail. This should start the Application in a Safe Mode.  If that does not work follow the three listed steps below.\n\n\n*Restart your computer  in Safe Mode. This will perform a Disk Repair, clear cache files and only load Apple Software, extensions and fonts. The boot up will be slow and can take some time. This is accomplished by restarting your computer and as soon as you hear the chime, hold down the Shift key and keep holding it down until the Apple logo appears on your screen.  After determining whether or not Mail now works properly, restart your Mac again as you normally do.\nNow the possible solutions get a bit more complicated:\n\n*\n\n*Delete then add back your e-mail account(s) on Mail:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mail/add-or-remove-email-accounts-mail35803/mac\nIf you have more than one account begin by deleting and restoring the one you suspect may be causing your problem.\n\n\n*From StackExchange\nWhat causes Apple Mail to repeatedly quit?\n“This used to happen to me in older versions of the Mail app (on previous versions of OS X/macOS).

For my Macbook, I'm considering moving photos to an external storage device. These photos are also on iCloud. If I remove the external storage device, will I still see the iCloud copy of the photos? Does it depend how I have photos configured?\n\nA: You cannot have more than one library connected to iCloud at the same time. This means:\n\n*\n\n*You can move your iCloud Photo Library to an external disk and it will continue syncing with iCloud\n\n*You can create a new photo library - which won't sync with iCloud by default. If you mark it as your system library, your other one will stop syncing.\n\nIf you want to keep a full copy of your iCloud Photo Library on your external disk, while still keeping access on-demand when you don't have the external disk, I recommend this process:\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user account and sign into your iCloud account\n\n*Open Photos on the new account and create a new library on your external disk. Mark it as your system library. You can do this, since it's a separate account. It won't affect your library from your main account.\n\n*Mark this library to download all photos and allow it to download all your photos.\n\n*When it completes, you can return to your main account and you have two libraries, both connected to iCloud.\n\nThe downside here is of course that the second one will NOT sync unless you login to that second account. I recommend making it a routine to login, open photos, and wait for all data to sync up every few weeks/months.\n", "Q: Preview increases the size of a tiff file created by epson scanner when manipulating it and saving I have an Epson scanner and i have scanned a photo to my mac book pro.\nI am running macOS BigSur 11.6.7.\nFinder is showing the size of the resulting .tiff file as 6.2mb. I wanted to select a portion of the photo and then create a new .tiff file from the selection.\nHere is what I did\n\n*\n\n*I opened the scan photo in the preview app.\n\n*I selected the portion of the image I wanted to create a new file out of.\n\n*Copy the selected portion.\n\n*Cmd N, this open a new tab which contains the copied portion of the image.\n\n*I saved the new file with a different name.\n\nThe size of the new file is 30mb.\nNow, I was expecting the new file to have a size much smaller than the original.\nWhat is happening? Why is the new file so big?\n\nA: TIFF images can either be compressed, or uncompressed. Uncompressed images will be number of pixels x bit-depth, so a 30Mb, 8-bit image is going to be around 5,500 pixels square. (A 16-bit 30 Mb image will have half the number of pixels, so c. 3,900 square).\nBy default, Preview will save without compression. When you Export the image from File > Export, there are options for the compression type, and you can see the effect on file size.\n\n", "Q: Wireless mouse very laggy when using external display I have a new MacBook Pro and whenever I'm using my external wireless mouse, the pointer is extremely laggy. Anecdotally, this only appears to happen when the external display is also in use; when using just the laptop display, the pointer moves fluidly. (The trackpad is not affected, with or without the external display.)\nThis answer suggests RF interference. I'm using an Apple Magic Keyboard -- which I believe is Bluetooth in the 2.4GHz range -- and 5GHz WiFi, but no other radio devices. Also, this doesn't explain why the problem only seems to occur when running on two displays.\nHardware:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro 2021 16\", Monterey\n\n*Iiyama G-Master 32\" (over HDMI)\n\n*Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic mouse (with USB-C to USB-A dongle)\n\n\nA: The solution to this turned out to be quite random; discovered by accident. It’s probably related to the discrete GPU comment, above…\nThe external display started losing its signal intermittently. Trying it from another device worked fine, so the display wasn’t faulty. Thus it’s either the HDMI cable or the MBP. Trying a different HDMI cable was easy and, lo and behold, the display is working again…and so is the mouse!\nBest guess is that the faulty cable was causing the dGPU to repeatedly power cycle in sync’ with whenever it could make a clear connection to the external display, but before the cable degraded to the point where it couldn’t maintain a sustained signal. The effect of which was manifested as laggy pointer movement.\n\nA: @xophmeister's answer is the correct answer. But if you're unable to change the cord and you need a temporary fix try this:\nGo into Settings > Displays > Display Settings.... Select your display and change its refresh rate to a random option. Then once it has been updated, change it back to the refresh rate you usually use. This should effectively resync the connection. I'm not sure how long this fix lasts, it seems to be random.\n\n", "Q: How to stop DNS spoofing warnings when I change boot media I am using my Mac as the base workstation to program for a Raspberry Pi project. I use SSH as the primary tool to communicate with and work on the Pi. In the process of experimenting and trying out hardware packages I often initialize a new microSD card, so I am frequently swapping between cards from which to boot my Pi.\nProblem: each card gets initialized with a different host key. So I am constantly seeing messages like the one below. Various advice I find online would suggest, just delete that host from ~/.ssh/known_hosts. But no! The message persists. Clearly, on the Mac, there is ANOTHER file of information about hosts, and it is keeping the old one around.  Where is that file?\nCan I just somehow suppress this entire warning system on my mac?

It is also possible that you have multiple SSH installations from multiple sources.\nIn any case, to address your specific ask:\nWhen connecting, you can specify a null known_hosts file and disable strict known_hosts checking:\nssh -o \"UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\" -o \"StrictHostKeyChecking=no\" [your_host_name]\nThis will bypass any specific host key checks, and also keep no host key history so there can't be any changes detected.\nCan also do this on a per-host basis, bypassing known_hosts checks only for your local network, using ~/.ssh/config and wildcard host matching:\n# whatever your local network is\nHost 192.168.1.*\n  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null\n  StrictHostKeyChecking no\n\nIf you have multiple SSH installations, you'd have to find the correct config file to edit first.\n", "Q: Auto-save local folder to iCloud Drive I prefer to have all my files saved locally on my Mac, be it Desktop, Documents, etc.\n\nBut there is one specific folder (/Users/mohitlamba/Documents/thesis/) and I wish that whenever any change is made to the contents of this folder, or some new file is added to this folder a copy of this folder should be saved/synced to iCloud.\nIs there a way to do it without syncing my whole Documents folder to iCloud.

While windows can do it easily (I was checking python, to be specific, after AppleScript & bash), macOS does not have such functionality. In AppleScript, in each individual app that supports it, you could read through manuals & manuals of Applescript to just get such an action working in a couple of apps (Pages seems to be one of the more promising ones).

Sometimes, after restarting, with or without one of the many magic key sequences to reset something, it would be okay for a while.\nJust before the beep, I noticed the screen dimmed briefly. There is a preferences option to dim the screen like this when going to battery power. I noticed the battery had not charged beyond 80%. There is an Optimised battery charging option in the Preferences. It wasn't ticked, but it says \"To reduce battery ageing, your Mac learns from your daily charging routine so it can wait to finish charging past 80% until you need to use it on battery.\"\n\nA: This solution may not cover all cases, but I have seen it twice. I am writing my solution here, so I can find it again if it happens a third time.\nI had an old MacBook-Pro with the magnetic power plug. This was doing roughly the same thing, and the reset commands were not helping. Someone suggested a faulty power supply. It was not that. I eventually traced the problem to a small metallic fragment that had got stuck in the magnetic socket.\nMy current macBook-Pro does not have a magnetic power cable. I am using the original charger. However, there were some clues that pointed to something connected with the power. If you are seeing a similar problem...\nUnplug the power supply. Does the beeping stop? If the computer is thinking it is swapping from the power supply to the battery and back again, this ought to fix it in one state.\nCheck the plug looks clean. Plug it into another socket. Does the beeping come back? It may be fine for some while depending on how long you have been on battery power. But this seemed to fix it for me.\nTry cleaning out the problem socket with a small, stiff, clean paintbrush.

It's unitless and doesn't imply any quantitative wattage.\nIn the Help file, Apple defines energy impact as\n\nA relative measure of the current energy consumption of the app\n(lower is better)\n\nIn 2015, an engineer from Mozilla performed an analysis on what constitutes energy impact, and found that it was (back then):\n\nthe formula used to compute “Energy Impact” is machine model-specific, and includes the following factors: CPU usage, wakeup frequency, quality of service class usage, and disk, GPU, and network activity.\n\nPresumably the measure has evolved since then, but probably has similar underlying factors.

When I start a search from my Home directory, the results will not include those from Documents if I limit the search to my Home directory. The results do show up if I choose the search location as \"This Mac\", but I would like them to show up in a search limited to my Home directory.\nAlternatively, the problem might be solved by performing a search of multiple directories at once.\nI have found that using Finder aliases rather than symlinks is not a solution to the problem, since Finder doesn't follow aliases either.\n\nA: Finder's Spotlight search interface is somewhat limited - as you have discovered.\nIs there a way? With third party software, Yes! And no need for symlinks, etc.\nI suggest you try HoudahSpot.  With HoudahSpot you can specify which locations (disks or folders) you want included in a search. You can create templates for different locations and search details.\nHoudahSpot does not create its own search index, rather it  uses the indexes created for Spotlight. It is a more powerful interface for searching the Spotlight indexes.\nThe developer, posted a reply to a related question How to search multiple spotlight sources / drives simultaneously?\n\nA: Make Spotlight search multiple paths by editing a saved search\nIt is possible to get Spotlight to search multiple directories at once, but it requires creating a saved search (smart folder), and then manually editing the .savedSearch XML file:\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, navigate to one of the directories you want to search, and click File > New Smart Folder.\n\n*To keep the queury as general as possible, you can move to step 3 now and add your search terms and conditions when you perform the actual search later. If, on the other hand, you want a narrower search any time you use this saved search in the future, you can type a search term in the search box and/or add conditions using the '+' icon underneath it.\n\n*Hit the save button below the search box, and check the option box to add a shortcut to the query to Finder's sidebar. The default save path is in your ~/Library, but I'm using an alternate path in my Documents folder so the file isn't buried and forgotten in the future. Keep the file extension as savedSearch -- the file name I used was Multi-Search.savedSearch, but this can be changed easily later.\n\n*Now I've got a Multi-Search sidebar item, but it's not that useful yet. Open the .savedSearch file in a text editor (e.g. textEdit.app or VS-Code). You will now be looking at an XML file with 200+ lines, but we only need to make a small edit.\n\n*The path to the directory where we created our search is written in 3 different places in the file: within SearchScopes, CurrentFolderPath, and FXScopeArrayOfPaths. We can leave SearchScopes and CurrentFolderPath alone, but we need to edit the FXScopeArrayOfPaths array to add the additional directories we want to search. Below the FXScopeArrayOfPaths key, copy the full line with the <string>...</string> tags and paste on a new line below (i.e. your new line should include the <string> tags and be within the <array> tags). Now edit the line you pasted to point to an additional path you want to search. Repeat if you want to search more paths.\n\n*Save the XML file. To change the name of the sidebar shortcut to this query, just edit the file name of the .savedSearch file. To activate the new functionality from the savedSearch, it is necessary to relaunch the Finder: hold option and right-click the Finder icon in the Dock, then choose Relaunch.\n\n*To use the search, click the icon in the sidebar of a Finder window, and type or search terms, or add conditions with the '+' icon as usual.\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*If you originally added as search string before creating the saved search, and you now want to remove it so it doesn't apply to all future searches, strip it from the XML by looking for the RawQuery key, and replacing its string with <string>false</string>. The key occurs in 2 places. Also remove the FXCriteriaSlices key and the array that follows it.\n\n*This answer suggests there's also a way to exclude paths from a search, by adding a dash in front of (full) paths in the arrays.\n\nSources: macsales.com article and this video.\n", "Q: Copying Windows files from exFAT to HFS+ I have an archive (roughly 1TB) of Windows & DOS files: essentially installation files from a lot of software and then a lot of personal documents (doc, pdf, excel, etc) that I had stored for a long time on an exFAT drive. I'm thinking of moving everything to a HFS+ drive (as I don't use a PC much, if I need to use a PC I can always copy them back to exFAT to access them), 2 questions:\n\n*\n\n*Is this fundamentally a good idea? I know that the 2 file systems are different and potentially some Windows filenames might not work on HFS+. Are there other incompartibility issues? I went through most of the files on exFAT and there are no hidden or other files still...\n\n*If I copy them is there a way to confirm what has been copied accurately and what not?\n\nthank you in advance!\n\nA: It won't by this point makes any major difference. ExFAT cannot carry 'extra' data or any permissions structure, MS terms some of this data as streams & would have already complained as you initially moved anything containing such streams as you initiated the original copy to ExFAT.\nBecause of this, there's nothing 'extra' to preserve, so the copy is not going to make any noticeable changes.\nThe HD internal firmware & the OS itself will manage the integrity of any copy process, so as you copy to HFS, you can rely on these to make sure this integrity is preserved [there could potentially be  an issue if data on the drive was already corrupted, but you're past this point anyway]. Windows installers are 'flat files' unlike Mac apps which are really folders, so there's nothing to lose in copying them too.\nAs regards file names, Windows has far more restrictions than Mac. You are probably already safe. Worry if you find one.\n", "Q: Can an MDM computer be taken over again? We are provided with laptops (MacBooks) in our company, but the laptops are provided by default with MDM JAMF maintenance. It is possible to ask that to be removed, and sometimes requests such as that are granted. I am not sure mine will, but I am in the process.\nI read about it, and I am trying to understand - would it be possible for the admins, once they let me remove MDM/etc. - to reinstall it again without my permission by sending some signal to the computer? Meaning, is there something persistent that cannot be changed once MDM is installed?\nI understand they can force to be again by default on MDM if you choose to wipe the computer, but that's not my intention.\nThe reason I ask is that we are allowed to use the laptops for some personal information, and I would feel irked if I knew the company's admin can reinstall an MDM profile without my permission or physical access to the laptop - especially I would feel uncomfortable with logging in to my Apple ID (I don't have a \"company\" Apple ID).\n\nA: What you describe is the Apple service that was initially called Device Enrollment Program (DEP) and is now called Automated Enrollment.\nThe device can be “taken over again” as that’s how the system is designed.\nYou can’t easily disable this, either since it’s an administrative record that Apple maintains. There are some guides to thwart it, but I’ve not seen a recently updated one.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204142\nApple doesn’t hide the fact when the MDM manage this enforced, but you would need to modify the firmware / activation process to get around it if your request is denied. If you manage to remove the MDM profile, you haven’t removed all the changes made by the MDM necessarily and if you erase the Mac, you’ll likely be prompted to re-enroll.\nYou could ask they retain the ability to manage the Mac, but remove you from active management. Then you could erase and use the machine privately and know if they decide to manage it again when you see the “enrollment approval” prompt.\nThe “should you mix private with work” discussion is highly personal. It’s really not worth it in my experience. Even bringing a work machine into your home network is sketchy if you’re not going to manage to separate the traffic and devices. Active MDM and surveillance and software that tries to monitor traffic for the workplace aren’t likely designed for subtle distinctions between a private home life and what one might expect/inspect/record in the workplace.\n\nIn the end, you have to trust them to a certain extent. If you feel they are honest in rescinding all \"remote monitoring\" then you might be safe. If you can't trust them, why risk it? Keep in mind, some parts of IT may be bound by NDA to never tell most staff what they do or just consider they work directly for the company and are there to investigate / snoop on people and not help them.\nThis conflict is something every professional IT team has to deal with and usually support / IT is mostly on your side and security / legal / HR isn't mostly on your side. YMMV and don't assume your team is anything like \"most\" or \"some\" since every country / region of country / industry / group is made up of individuals.

However, in the input source menu there is no way to completely remove a keyboard layout (apart from disabling it).\n\nA: Custom layouts are stored in /Library/Keyboard Layouts directory (Systemwide) or ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts directory (User only).  Go there and delete them.\nTo get to a specific directory, in Finder press ⌘ CMD + ⇧ Shift + G and copy paste one of the paths above and press ⏎ Enter.\n", "Q: Wifi on a Mac Pro 4,1 I recently bought a Mac Pro 4,1. Flashed it to 5,1 and such.\nThe thing is, it doesn't seem to have any WiFi card. It doesn't recognize a WiFi USB that I have here lying around that I bought for my main PC which has Windows installed. I am not sure if these machines came with a WiFi card in all of its configurations.\nI don't need AirDrop or anything like that, since I bought it to tinker with it (I love retrocomputing) and to get myself used to the Apple Mac OS system. So I don't really think I will need the best WiFi card out there. Do you know if there is something that should work not doing it? (Like detecting the USB WiFi).\nIf this is the expected behaviour, can someone redirect me to a cheap WiFi card? I just don't want to have the Ethernet cable around because it is uncomfortable in the position I have the router in my house.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The WiFI board on Mac Pro [cheesegraters] was an optional purchase.\nThey are easy to find on eBay as DIY add-ins. They are not difficult to fit, but you need to strip the machine a bit to get to the location on the motherboard.\nFortunately, this is a bit easier on the 4,1 than earlier Mac Pros. you can reach it if you take the processor tray out.\n\n\nImages from the official Apple Service Source manual for the Mac Pro 4,1\nThe wires & screws should be in place already, even if no board was originally shipped with it - but it's wise to check first.\nExample eBay selection [UK]\nBluetooth was optional too, which is why you often find these boards being sold in pairs.\nApple at the time designated these as 'AirPort Extreme' cards, back when 'WiFi' wasn't as ubiquitous a term as it since became.\n", "Q: Can’t post photos in FB iOS. No setting for it My wife’s iPhone XR has the FB app on it. It will not allow photos to be posted. When you try it says it needs to have access, and takes you to the Facebook settings panel. There is no setting there for photos. There is Siri, notifications, background app refresh and cellular data. Nothing else. On my iPhone there is a page of settings, including photos. I have force quit the app, updated the app, no luck. Suggestions?\n\nA: Usually when there's an issue with not being able to access Photos within another app, it's due to lack of permissions. When you attempt to post a photo for the first time, you should get the following prompt within the Facebook app:\n\nIf you're not getting that, it's likely that the dialog was dismissed by clicking \"Don't Allow\" on the following modal:\n\nIf you don't see that modal when choosing \"Continue\" in the Facebook app, try removing the app completely, including all local data, and then reinstalling the app from the App Store. That should reset all local permissions for the app and allow you to select \"Select Photos...\" or \"Allow Access to All Photos\". The option for \"Don't Allow\" is not a cancel button and will restrict access to the photo album for as long as the app is installed or you change in system settings.\n\nA: Do you often post photos to Facebook and are OK with letting Facebook access all your photos? If yes, open the Settings app on the iPhone > tap Privacy > Photos > Facebook > All Photos. After this, you'll be able to post photos when using the Facebook app.\nIf you only want to allow Facebook limited access, follow the above steps but tap Selected Photos. Now tap 'Edit selected photos' and check mark the photos you might want to share on Facebook. After this, you'll be able to post these selected photos when using the Facebook app. To add more photos to the selection, go to Facebook app > tap the 'add photo' button > Manage > Select More Photos > choose the photos > Done. After this, the newly added photos will also become available for posting.\n", "Q: Setting up phone for parent, want picture to call a phone number I'm trying to understand how to setup a picture of myself for my father's iPhone so he can press on the picture of me (on his home screen) and it will call me.\nI found this site callmeicons.com (I haven't been to it) from this video https://www.google.com/search?q=how+do+I+make+a+picture+dial+a+number%3F+iphone&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS947US947&oq=how+do+I+make+a+picture+dial+a+number%3F++iphone&aqs=chrome..69i57.13835j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#kpvalbx=_sEy3YoJHxqzk2g_M0ofIBg17\nwhich explains how to set this up, but I don't understand how it works and it seems to be making calls through that site which I don't want to do.\nIs there a way to on an iPhone setup a picture on the home screen to call a phone number.\n\nA: The call a contact action is built in to shortcuts.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios\nYou can add shortcuts to Siri or the Home Screen. I think you need something like Widgetsmith or scriptable to convert a shortcut to Lock Screen widget but iOS 16 might have even more options when it ships.\nYou also should try adding your contact to their Home Screen - that way you can have the person’s face and other contact details ready for FaceTime, messages, etc…\n", "Q: Fetch data from Preview.app to Terminal I want to be able to get all the pdf files currently opened by my Preview app into Terminal.

I might be able to get the data from console or doing a ps command from terminal.\nAs of now all such attempts of mine haven't gotten me anywhere.

Both RAM boards have a red LED lighting constantly while the computer runs... is this normal or does this indicate another problem ? could not find anything regarding this in the service manual...\n\nA: Having worked on Mac Pros of this vintage (the A1186 had 3 different models between Aug 06 & Mar 09) there could be any number of things wrong from a bad HD (the clicking) to a toasted power supply.\nOne nasty side effect of a  zapped power supply is there is a possibly of some collateral damage to the main & peripheral boards, PCI cards, HD power supplies, etc, when it either degraded over time, experienced a sudden failure, or was electrically damaged by a bad AC power transient from the premises wiring.\nYou need to replace the PRAM battery as well. A simple alkaline CR2032 button battery should do the trick.\nRemoving and reseating every PCI board, ribbon cable, and RAM module is also recommended, but only if you know what you're doing! Replacement parts are next to impossible to find, however.\nI assume you've followed the troubleshooting steps starting on page 152 of the MacPro A1186 late 2008 service manual (which I've included here for others who are seeking this info.)\nAnother option is something like this site for a source of spare parts, or just to start from scratch.\n", "Q: Can you have a second \"virtual\" screen when remoted into your Mac, like you can with Windows RDP? I am using 2x monitors on my main workstation (Mac Pro desktop). I can connect to my Macbook via VNC (\"sharing\") but it only shows the single physical laptop screen and I cannot stretch it across both of my monitors:\n\nI have Apple Remote Desktop and am connecting from a different Mac, but it's the same - just the single, physical screen. Is it possible to have a second \"virtual\" screen when remoted into your Mac, like you can with Windows RDP? If so, how can I set this up?\n\nA: Yes, you can - but it requires a bit of third party kit.\nHardware Solution\nIf you add a \"dummy HDMI dongle\", macOS will think you have an extra display - and that will be accessible when using VNC.\nI have linked to a random Amazon vendor of those dongles, but they come in a lot of different models at various price points.\nSoftware Solution\nA program named BetterDummy can create virtual displays similar to how a dummy HDMI dongle would create a virtual display. That should also work as a display accessible when using VNC. However, I have not actually tried this solution.\n\nA: try pressing option while you switch the radio button in the display settings of the virtual display, it might show \"all resolution\"  and therefore allow you to select your aspect ratio\n", "Q: How can I get minimised windows in different desktops to un-minimise in my current desktop? If I minimise a window in Desktop 1, then move to Desktop 2 and un-minimise the window it moves me back to Desktop 1.

Set the App's Space affinity to \"All Desktops\", then it will always follow you.\n\n", "Q: Can my old iTunes libraries be transferred to my new computer? It took me long, tedious hours and a lot of effort to digitalise vinyl and taped music (from the 60s onwards) as well as copying umpteen CDs to my iMac that I bought in 2011 and now uses Sierra 10.12.6 and iTunes 12.8.2.3.\nI now want to buy the newest M1 computer using Ventura and I've found out that iTunes no longer exists. Everything I've read so far only talking about transferring music bought from Apple.\nCan my old iTunes libraries be transferred to the new Music app. If so, how, or do I just give up and keep my old computer?\n\nA: Apple Music [without any subscription] is really just iTunes with a different label.\nFuntionality has been split, so iPhone/Pad interaction is now done from Finder. Instead of launching a separate app to sync/backup your iPhone etc, the functionality [& most of the look] is now right there in the Finder instead.\nMusic itself still looks similar to how iTunes looked, with Artists, Albums, Songs, Playlists etc down the left.\n\nIt still defaults to trying to sell you new tunes from the Store, but if you're not interested in that you can ignore it, same as iTunes.\nIf you migrate* your old Mac to your new one, everything should transfer intact.\n*Make this the first thing you do as part of your initial setup on the new Mac. It makes things much easier than trying to do it later.\n", "Q: How are iOS apps geo-restricted on the Apple App Store? Is this something decided by the developer, or is it decided by Apple? How are apps geo-restricted on the Apple App Store?\nCan the developer choose which countries his/her app will be available in when he submits this to the Apple App Store? Or is this something decided by Apple themselves? If the former, how does he specify this? If the latter, how does Apple decide which countries an app will be available in?\n\nA: It's been a great while since I've had anything in the App Store, but yes, the developer chooses what countries to make his app available in. It's not a decision made by Apple themselves, unless there's some sort of regulatory restriction on a single or category of apps in a particular country.\nWhen the developer goes to publish submit their application before review by Apple, there should be a section that allows the developer to specify in which countries they'd like to make the app available for download.\n\nA: Developers must choose which regions they make an app for sale. They have banking and tax and potentially legal agreements to review.\nApple reviews and also has a regulatory position and may pass on region specific guidance or have special reviews in some cases.\n", "Q: \"Unsupported OS\" when using `open` command on M1 Pro The open command on macOS usually opens files in their default application.\nOn my new M1 Pro though it just always says \"Unsupported OS\"\n❯ open test.txt\nOpening 'test.txt' ...\nUnsupported OS.\n\nAny ideas why this could be happening?\nTo be clear it does not matter what I try to run be it an app or a file:\n❯ open -a TextEdit\nOpening '-a TextEdit' ...\nUnsupported OS\n\nIt does not matter what the file type is either.\nNothing can be run with open no matter what the arguments are I will get the same response.\n\nA: First thing is to open the app you want to see these files.\nopen -a TextEdit\n\nOr Xcode or another app you know can open text files.\nOnce you have an app that opens, pass the file after the name of the app.\nopen -a TextEdit file.txt\n\nOnce that works, open the folder containing that text file and inspect the finder contextual menu and perhaps refresh the “Always open with” binding for that file type.

Today, I carry my iPhone and GPS-only Apple Watch everywhere I go. I've realized that I don't really need my phone for 99% of tasks. My Watch is enough to complete those. These tasks are:\n\n*\n\n*Receive iMessages & send short replies\n\n*Receive email notifications (built-in Mail app) and reply\n\n*View & manage lists (e.g. shopping lists) in Reminders\n\n*Occasionally view the locations of loved ones in Find My\n\nFor a variety of reasons, I'd love to leave my iPhone at home on most outings. I'm considering getting an LTE Apple Watch, but the documentation I can find is oddly vague about what I could do without carrying my phone:\n\n*\n\n*Apple - Use your Apple Watch without your iPhone nearby, oddly no mention of email or even \"notifications\" in general\n\n*Reddit, 2021 - Can’t get new mail on Apple Watch via cellular (both Mail app AND Outlook), claims they can send email but not receive (huh?), single answer claims that's normal behavior.\n\n*Apple Forums - Cellular Apple Watch E-Mail when iphone is off [2020] and Sending and Receiving email with only Apple Watch Series 3 [2017] suggest you can send & receive email, as long as the paired phone is switched on (but not necessarily with you).\n\nOverall, this not encouraging towards a cellular Apple Watch as a basic connectivity replacement for a phone, but reports are mixed and some are pretty old.\nIs anyone here able to give first-hand reports of how well connectivity - especially email, as that seems to be the pain point - works on a cellular Apple Watch with its paired phone left at home?\n\nA: I’ve never had a case where the watch has let me down yet. I rarely carry my phone for trips around my neighborhood and almost always leave my wallet home as well.\nOn some backcountry trips, I’ve had my watch connect before the phone which is not something I would have guessed based on antenna size and power of the battery and CPU.\nThe only reason I need a iPhone or iPad is:\n\n*\n\n*a physical keyboard\n\n*app I can’t manage with Siri and airpods\n\n*a larger screen\n\nNothing substantial has changed negatively in this regard since series 3 so my presumption is people just have software / server issues or coverage issues. There is no arguing that the smaller screen is limiting as the fewer troubleshooting or logs you can access only from the watch, but Apple support should be able to help anyone with these issues get the logs later when you are home or on wifi to diagnose issues that will crop   up with any networked computer.\nOn the plus side, battery life, screen brightness, additional sensors, speed and quality of apps are all substantially better than 5 years ago.\nThe things you mention are things cellular and Apple Watch do very well - I prefer my watch over an iPhone or iPad for many tasks, especially reminders and prompt messaging and status checks.\n", "Q: How do I retrieve a list of all my songs on the iPhone?

I am not certain that its actually connecting to anything, but could be a issue.\nHow would you figure out what is triggering this process?\n\n\nA: At some point, someone probably tried to use Mail.app to send mail, but didn't have it configured properly. This might be causing sendmail to keep trying to deliver that mail.\nIf you are at least somewhat comfortable using Terminal, you can try to figure it out.\nFirst, type man sendmail. That will identify a number of tools you can use to figure things out.\nNext, if you type mailq, it may show you mail that is \"stuck\" in the queue — or it may tell you postqueue: fatal: Queue report unavailable - mail system is down. If the latter, then I am probably wrong about how you got here, and you'll have to explore other things.\nAt the end of the sendmail man page (in the \"SEE ALSO\" section) are a number of other man pages you can look at. In particular, if mailq is not empty, you can try sudo postfix abort to promptly shut down the mail system.\nAnother place to explore is the Console.app command.

I've found all the instructions on how to do that, but when you follow those steps, and the Macbook starts up in that mode where you're given the option to select to scorch the system and reinstall the OS from scratch, in that mode, the external monitor doesn't work.  It's some kind of a limited mode that requires you to use the built-in monitor (and probably the built-in keyboard).   This is an \"Early 2013 MacBook\", and I use Catalina.\nAnyone got any thoughts on how I can do this?   I'm thinking there may be a way to do this with some kind of automation -- like - maybe there's a way to automate the process of reimaging a MacBook from scratch that doesn't require any interaction, which means, it will work unattended and thus wouldn't matter if I can see the screen or not while it's doing its thing.  Perhaps part of some type of an admin / IT tool?\nThoughts?\n(I really hope someone doesn't post an \"Answer\" that says I should upgrade my Macbook :(\n\nA: If you close the lid of your laptop while booted to Recovery Mode, then the external display should become active (as the 'only' display now in operation).\nHowever, you will need an external keyboard and input device to use the computer.\nAlternatively, you can install macOS on an external USB drive, then boot from that (either by selecting Alt at startup, or by selecting the volume in System Preferences).\nOnce you're booted into an external, the internal disk is not in use, and can therefore be erased, reinstalled, etc.\nNB: On Catalina and later, you will see that your disk is split into two volumes: \"Macintosh HD\" and \"Macintosh HD - Data\".\nThe first one is for the OS (including Apple-bundled apps like Mail, Chess, TextEdit, etc). Normally, this volume is mounted read-only, and cannot be modified.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-in/HT210650\nThe second, (\"Data\") is for 'everything else'. Installed applications, user data, etc, etc.\nmacOS presents the two volumes to you in Finder merged together as one virtual volume.\nThis actually means that you don't need to wipe the entire disk, but only erase the \"Data\" volume.\n", "Q: Connecting a Apple Thunderbolt Display 27 inch 2016 to a HP Elitebook 840 G8 via HDMI or USB-C or any active adapter?

I'm trying to modify /System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions/CocoaStandard.sdef. I want to do this because a lot of applications reference this file in their own scripting definitions, and I want to experiment with adding new stuff that will take effect in every application. Since scripting definition entries map directly to Cocoa objects and their methods, I figure this would be an effective way to mess with other applications' objects.\nI rebooted to Recovery OS and ran the following commands in a terminal:\ncsrutil disable\numount \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\"\nmkdir /Volumes/mhd\nmount /dev/disk3s1 /Volumes/mhd\ncd /Volumes/mhd/System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions\nmv CocoaStandard.sdef CocoaStandard.sdef.original\nln -s /Library/ScriptingDefinitions/CocoaStandard.sdef .\nreboot\n\nNote that I have already placed a copy of CocoaStandard.sdef in /Library/ScriptingDefinitions.\nThe problem I'm running into is that, despite disabling System Integrity Protection, once I reboot into macOS, the changes I made in /System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions have somehow been reverted. There is no CocoaStandard.sdef.original, and CocoaStandard.sdef is once again a regular file rather than a symbolic link.\nHow do I stop these changes from being reverted? Alternatively, if there is a better way to add custom scripting definitions to existing applications, that would work as well. (I tried directly adding entries to the .sdef inside a copy of the application, but then whenever I try to control that copy of the application using AppleScript, I get error -1728.)\n\nA: I read later that (like @red_menace pointed out in the comments) the behavior was caused by the sealed system volume. I haven't done this, but csrutil authenticated-root disable at the recovery terminal should prevent it from occurring. But according to this page, there are various reasons why that might not be desirable, especially for something that can be accomplished in other ways.\nSpecifically, the way I found that works was to create a disk image in Disk Utility, and then mount it at /System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions. This will temporarily replace the contents of the directory with the contents of the disk image without actually modifying anything on disk. The basic steps to do that are:\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility.\n\n*File->New Image->Blank Image...\n\n*Set a smaller file size (I used 16 MB, though even that is an awful lot) and save the disk image. I saved it to the desktop as ScriptDefs.dmg.\n\n*Place the modified CocoaStandard.sdef in the mounted disk image, and eject it.\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n*hdiutil attach ~/Desktop/ScriptDefs.dmg\n\n*Look at the list that appears, and find the /dev/disk#s# listed at the bottom.\n\n*sudo mount -t apfs -o nobrowse /dev/disk#s# /System/Library/ScriptingDefinitions (replacing disk#s# with the values from above)\n\nAccording to my testing, this will (understandably) fail with a \"permission denied\" error if System Integrity Protection is enabled, so you'll have to disable that first. Also, don't create a compressed DMG, because for whatever reason that'll fail with the same error even if SIP is off.\n", "Q: Is it possible to measure noise levels with the iPhone alone?

We've got Intune set up at work, and I'm trying to push a custom iOS app out to several iPod Touches we have. Intune is set up and working properly, but the app refuses to install because it's integrity cannot be verified. I believe this is because my app is not signed properly (?), but no matter what I do, I can't seem to get it to work.\nHere's my set up, and what I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*We've got Intune set up, and I've made an MDM profile called \"iPod Enrolment Profile\". When that profile is installed on an iPod, the iPod is added to a dynamic group called \"iPod Touches\", and that deploys the app.\n\n*I've got a (personal) Apple developer account. I've created a provisioning profile for App Store distribution (though I also tried Ad-Hoc distribution as well)\n\n*\n\n*I've added that provisioning profile to Intune as well, though I think that's only for renewing the app, and not needed for the initial install?\n\n\n\n*In Xcode, I've set up automatic signing. If I have the iPod plugged in, Xcode tells me that the device isn't registered into my developer account. I'd rather not register it, because I want any future iPods or iPads or iPhones we buy to be enrollable without needing an Apple developer account. If I switch off automatic signing and make Xcode use the provisioning profile I created, \"Signing (Debug)\" uses my distribution signing certificate, but Signing (Release)\" complains that it doesn't include my Apple Development signing certificate\n\nAnd here's how I'm enrolling the iPods\n\n*\n\n*I have Apple Configurator 2 installed\n\n*I created a profile that sets up wifi and certificates\n\n*I created a blueprint that does the following:\n\n*\n\n*Prepares the iPod. Does NOT enrol to an MDM, does NOT add to Apple School Manager (we have an account for this, if that's relevant) or Apple Business Manager, is supervised, allows pairing with other computers\n\n*Installs the wifi profile I created in AC2\n\n*Installs the MDM profile I created in Intune.\n\n\n\n*I restore the iPod, then apply the blueprint.\n\n*AC2 complains that the steps can't complete because the iPod is not supervised, but when I check, the two profiles are installed.\n\n*I wait a few minutes, and the app starts to download, but then fails with the integrity verification error.\n\nSo I've got a few ideas of what is going on:\n\n*\n\n*I'm building or signing my app incorrectly. or..\n\n*I need an Apple Enterprise Developer account in order to push this app in-house, because signing the app without an AED is meant either for specific devices (ad-hoc provisioning profile), development machines (development provisioning profile) or for distribution on the App store (app store provisioning profile) or..\n\n*I need to add the devices to Apple School Manager so they can be verified (?)\n\nAm I getting close?\nThe tl;dr is: What do I need to do in order to build my app so that I can deploy it to an arbitrary number of supervised, MDM controlled iOS / iPadOS devices?\n\nA: You cannot deploy to devices in this manner. You will want to enroll in the Apple Developer Enterprise program. This will allow you to sign your app for internal distribution and deploy it via MDM. Follow Apple's recommendations here.\nIn theory, you could also add each and every device to your provisioning profile for your own personal developer account for preliminary testing. It's not the right way to do it, there's limitations on the number of devices, and it's really not practical at scale.\n\nA: A few months on from this, I've got a few potential answers.\nThe first, as is mentioned in the answer by jksoegaard, is to get an Apple Developer Enterprise account. When you fill out the form in the Getting Started section of their website, they'll call you and quiz you about why you need the enterprise program. They are really quite hesitant to sign people up for that when there's alternatives. This method lets you install it however you want, whether that's by emailing it to someone, or pushing it out via InTune, or hosting it on your company's intranet for people to just tap on and install.\nThe second, is that if you're deploying to under 100 devices (which we are, at least initially), you can just add the devices you want to your developer account, then build the app using that provisioning profile. There's info on how to bulk add devices on the Apple site. All you need is an Apple Developer account. This means you'll probably need to physically handle the devices first, but it limits which devices can have the app and bypasses the Apple Store.\nThe third, which wasn't made known to me until I had a second half hour phone call with Apple asking me why I wanted the enterprise account, is that if you have Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager and a developer account, you can publish apps privately. They've got info on their website. This is great because it works with InTune as long as the app is free.\nAnd side note, if you're an educational institute (e.g. a school or university), you may be eligible for a free developer account, but have a chat to Apple first, as I don't know if that applies to everyone or everywhere.\n", "Q: How to ship logs from macOS to a remote syslog server? I have a standard syslog server running on a LAN host and listening on UDP port 514. I'm trying to have my Mac (running macOS 12.4 with SIP enabled) ship logs in syslog format to this remote server.\nI was able to figure out that if I edit /etc/syslog.conf and add e.g. the following line:\n# send all logs to 192.168.10.10\n*.*  @192.168.10.10:514\n\nand then bounce syslogd:\nsudo launchctl kickstart -kp system/com.apple.syslogd\n\nThat I do see some logs being sent to the server. However, many log entries are missed because of Apple's new Unified Logging System (ULS). I am aware of /etc/asl.conf which also has some relevant logging config, but I was unable to figure out if or how this could be used to ship logs to a remote machine.\nI also am aware of the log command, and can use it to query and output in syslog format, e.g.\nlog show --info --predicate 'messageType > 2' --last 60s --style syslog\n\nI thought about using this to periodically (via a LaunchAgent) query and ship the logs using netcat or some other simple tool. But this seems quite inefficient, as I'd need to parse each line and store a hash somewhere to see if that message had already been sent to avoid duplicates. Also, some log entries span multiple lines, so parsing with things like sed or awk become cumbersome.\nWithout adding too many 3rd party tools to the mix, does anyone have a recipe for sending a more complete set of logs to a remote server?\n\nA: The core problem you have is Apple unified the system logging and the files no longer contain the entries you need. It’s a highly structured database with TTL / verbosity / relevance baked in to the logging database structures.\n\nThis means you may want to rethink your consumption of the files or how you filter the data that’s important to you.\nShort term, you’ll want to change the logging configuration to dump the events you need to log files of your choice so you can maximize the value of your old central logging platform.\nYou will need extensive expertise on a team to avoid third party tools for recent macOS versions, there’s no easy fix here and you are on the correct path. Hopefully thinking about what you really need and when you need it will help guide your efforts.\n\nA: I would like to point out that there are quite readily available, easy to use and free 3rd party tools for solving this problem:\nIn particular, the remote_syslog2 utility is relatively easy to setup as it will collect logs from the Unified Logging System (as well as other sources) and send them off to a remote syslog server.\nIf you want to not use third party tools, you can start on the command line by getting a stream of logs from the ULS in syslog format like this:\nlog stream --style syslog\n\nAnd then script that using the built-in Perl and its Sys::Syslog module.\n", "Q: Calendar.app: disable event-specific alerts while retaining calendar-wide alerts I would like to essentially move all of my calendar alerts to appear 5 minutes before the event, rather than the time chosen by the event creator (typically 10 minutes).

Selecting 'Ignore alerts' in the calendar info will ignore all alerts, even the configured 5 minute alerts in the settings panel:\n\nHow can I receive only a 5 minute alert for all events?\n\nA: *\n\n*In Calendar.app go to View -> Show Calendar List and turn off all the other calendars that you don't want to affect.\n\n*Then select the remaining calendar and go to File -> Export and export that calendar to .ics file\n\n*Open the .ics file in a text editor such as Visual Studio Code.\n\n*Replace all the TRIGGER:-P10M with TRIGGER:-P5M\nThis will change all the 10 minute before event alarms on the calendar to be 5 minutes before the event.\nThis will not affect any alerts that were set as (default) so if they were set at the system default they will continue to obey the system defaults that you set.\n\n*Save the file\n\n*(optional) create a new test calendar that's blank with no appointments.\n\n*import into Calendar.app onto the desired calendar.\n\n", "Q: Manually manage the download of OS updates?

(it'd be ridiculous) \nIf it's not enough, we can only declare but we obviously can't guarantee that we are not going to use the access tokens off of the device, because we send them to our backend.\n\nA: Only Apple can really determine if something is a violation of your agreement with them.\nHowever, given the scenario you describe, it sounds reasonable that this would be allowed, and not flagged by the App Store review team as a validation.\nNote that I base this on the fact that you write that logins to the social network happens from the app itself on device, that the tokens are not stored on y our server, that your servers does not attempt to communicate with the social network and that the token is only used for verifying that the user has indeed successfully logged in.\n", "Q: Does macOS's newer \"Erase All Content and Settings\" feature yield different results than reformatting the startup drive? According to Apple,\n\n\"macOS Monterey includes Erase All Content and Settings, a way to\nquickly and securely erase all of your settings, data, and apps, while\nmaintaining the operating system currently installed.\"\n\nDoes anyone know the details about what happens in the background and if it differs from erasing the drive via Disk Utility in Recovery Mode and reinstalling macOS?\nExtra info: Apple put my M1 MacBook Pro in an out-of-box state recently when they were servicing it. I used Migration Assistant to restore from a Time Machine backup, and since then have been experiencing a number of bugs with various apps (both native & 3rd party) and iCloud syncing. So I'd like to just rebuild this machine from scratch. I'm wondering if Erase All Content and Settings might leave any trace system settings or files that were created from or since restoring via Migration Assistant.\n\nA: By default, macOS creates two separate volumes on your disk: \"Macintosh HD\" and Macintosh HD - Data\". (Since Catalina.)\nThe first contains the Operating System files, including apps like Mail, TextEdit, etc. It is normally read-only, and cryptographically sealed, so that any modification will be flagged.\nThe second volume contains all your data: not only user accounts, but system prefs and settings, files added to /Library, third-party apps, caches, etc, etc.\nNormally, macOS presents the two volumes 'as one', hiding the division in the Finder.\nConsequently, erasing the \"Data\" volume will remove any user-defined settings, parameters, software, and anything else. This is what Erase All Contents does.\nThere is no need or point in erasing the OS volume, because its contents have not changed.\nErasing All Contents and Settings is a broad tool for fixing a problem. I would only do that after trying other trouble-shooting techniques, such as testing in a new user account; testing in Safe Boot mode; signing out and in of AppleID, etc, etc.\nYou could even try just restoring the entire Data volume from your TM backup, rather than 'migrating' from it.\nModern disk formats are increasingly complex: there are Volume Groups, Containers, Logical Volumes and more. The internal disk also contains the recovery partition, EFI firmware partition, etc.\nThe concept of \"I'll just wipe the disk and start again\" is a bit 90s. ;-)\n", "Q: macOS External Drive 2TB I have a mac Mini M1 and I want to install macOS on an external drive. I have a LaCie Rugged Mini 2 TB. The drive needs to converted from MBR to GPT. There is a special product called Paragon Hard Disk Manager for Mac, but it does not support M1. What is the way to install macOS on an external drive?\n\nA: When I originally went to LaCie's website Rugged Portable Hard Drives, I saw the following details in the popup for the Rugged Mini.\n\nHowever, the \"Works With\" is for all the Rugged Portable Hard Drives and not just for the Rugged Mini. The specs show the LaCie Rugged Mini 2 TB only has a \"1 x USB-C (USB 3.0 compatible)\" interface.\nWhen checking the Rugged Mini User Manual, one finds the cable included only has a Type A plug, which does not fit USB-C port.\nI have concluded the OP probably has this drive plugged into one of the USB-A ports (up to 5Gb/s) on the Mac mini.\n\nNote the following.\n\n*\n\n*HDD do not work well with APFS volumes, which is required for Monterey. You should be using an external SSD.\n\n\n*HDD generally are to slow to be used for the current releases of macOS. LaCie specs state 130 MB/s for the Rugged Mini. However, since there are other mistakes in the documentation, I would not trust this be correct.\n\n\n*The question Installing macOS on an external SSD fails (m1) has a link to the article Booting an M1 Mac from an external disk: it is possible. Below is an excerpt take from this article.\n\nYou’ll need the following: a Thunderbolt 3 SSD, such as a Samsung X5, freshly formatted in APFS (unencrypted) and connected to one of your M1 Mac’s Thunderbolt ports; if you only have SATA SSDs which connect via USB-C rather than Thunderbolt, you may be successful, but it seems unlikely. Some suggest that if your SSD isn’t Thunderbolt, try connecting it via a USB-A port, although that doesn’t help those with MacBook Air or Pro models;\n\nThe result is you probably are not able to boot a HDD from the Type A port. Even if you could, the performance of Monterey would probably be unacceptable slow.\n", "Q: One partition on external HDD not mounting, disk not ejecting I have a problem with my external HDD from Seagate.

I have tested the HDD with another Mac but the issues remain.\nRunning diskutil list gives:\nApple$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI ⁨EFI⁩                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk1⁩         121.1 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +121.1 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨Macintosh HD - Data⁩     85.2 GB    disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 591.9 MB   disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                1.6 GB     disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      1.1 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume ⁨Macintosh HD⁩            15.2 GB    disk1s5\n   6:              APFS Snapshot ⁨com.apple.os.update-...⁩ 15.2 GB    disk1s5s1\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                        EFI ⁨EFI⁩                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS ⁨time_mach2⁩              203.0 GB   disk2s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS ⁨what_toDo⁩               203.1 GB   disk2s3\n   4:                  Apple_HFS ⁨things_kept⁩             593.5 GB   disk2s4\n\nI have tried out all the suggestions given in the post External drive does not mount after plug off without eject but to no avail.

I hope this is solvable. The problematic partition \\dev\\disk2s2 contains my time machine backup of three years. Thank you for any help.\n\nA: I could solve the primary problem by following the suggestion of https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/329482 . I downloaded and ran the free version of Disk Drill. It wanted to rebuild HFS+ catalog and ran some kind of scan. I did not rebuild the catalog  but after this scan the time machine partition, /dev/disk2s2, mounted and I could mount or unmount all the partitions and eject the disk. I ran First Aid from Disk Utility and also diskutil repairVolume on all the partitions. I find that in both cases the process is taking a lot of time, especially I think at the steps checking catalog files' ,checking multi-linked files' and checking multi-linked directories. At the end though they give File system check exit code is 0'. This partition has become very slow otherwise also.\nApart from this, on this external hdd I am having to run `diskutil repairVolume' with sudo as otherwise I am getting the error :\nError starting file system repair for disk2s2 (time_mach2): This operation is restricted by Sandbox; check your settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Files and Folders (-69464).\nI fail to understand and/or resolve this. There must be some problem with the partition /dev/disk2s2 or may be the entire disk still now though it has become accessible and usable. Any suggestion would be  helpful.

Let's say I develop an app and sell it in the App Store. I make sure the app complies with all of Apple's policies. But outside the App Store, it's clear from social media that I'm in favor of jailbreaking. Maybe I develop apps that wouldn't be allowed in the App Store and distribute them over unofficial channels. Or maybe I have another version of the same app that doesn't adhere to Apple's policies, which I distribute outside the App Store. If Apple finds out about that, would that likely be a problem in practice, assuming I don't promote any of that stuff within my app or its App Store listing?\n\nA: You're essentially asking \"If I enter an agreement with Apple and wilfully break said agreement, would that cause me problems in practice?\". Nobody can answer that for you that.\nOf course you can enter in an agreement with them and break it. If your app becomes as popular as Fortnite and Instagram combined, they'll probably find out and have it escalated within the relevant team at Apple. They might sanction you, they might not.\nIf you app is a niche app downloaded by few people that never complain about it, they might never find out - and even if someone at Apple is aware, that person might never contact the relevant team for escalation. There might be no consequence at all.\nOn the other hand, it's not a guarantee - there's a risk that the right person will you see you breaking the agreement, and then they could terminate that agreement.\nA practical advice for you would be open up a company that is an independent legal person, and let that company enter into the agreement with Apple for distributing the app. Your interests in jail-breaking as a private person probably won't affect that agreement then.\n", "Q: Connecting Bluetooth headset to MacBook Pro, won't last more than a second I'm trying to connect my bluetooth headset to a MacBook Pro (my work laptop).\n(It's an Anko/Kmart neckband with earphones and mic, which is working perfectly with all other Windows/Android devices).\nOn my Mac, I can see the headset in System Preferences > Bluetooth.\n\nWhen I hit Connect:\n\n*\n\n*\"Not Connected\" changes to \"Connected\", the headset appears briefly in System Preferences > Sound, while I hear the \"connected sound\" in my headset,\n\n*immediately followed by \"disconnected sound\", while the \"Connected\" changes back to \"Not Connected\", and the headset disappears from System Preferences > Sound\nIt won't stay connected for more than a second, often less than a second.\nAny idea how to fix this?\nEDIT 1\nI tried clicking \"Connect\" like crazy and after 20+ tries it now stays connected!\n\nBut this time I can't see it in System Preferences > Sound at all, and therefore no sound through the headset.\nEDIT 2\nAfter more tries (ie. cliking like crazy), it stays connected and the device stays in System Preferences > Sound.

So, I just 'saved' an iMac A1312 (2009) that was about to be thrown away with a bunch of other computers, at the university where I work. Most of the time the computers that are thrown out are in perfect or almost perfect condition, just a bit old.\nSo I got that iMac and I am trying to see if it works.

I get the following error :\n'This disk has SMART errors. This disk has a hardware problem that cant be repaired.  Back up data and replace the disk'\nOkay, that's not so good. I can try replacing the HDD as last resort, but first I would like to know if there are other possible solutions.\nI tried booting from a usb, and formatting the hdd. However, I get the same error if I try to install again. SMART status of the drive is 'failing'.\nI'm pretty sure my only option is to replace the drive, but I would like to know if there is something to try first.\n(The fact that the computer boots up is independent of the state of the drive ? In other words, am I in the equivalent of the BIOS right now ?)\nEdit : I should mention thst I formatted to  'Mac OS Extended (journaled)', with GUID partition scheme.\n\nA: Why not set this Mac up to boot from an external drive?\nYou could then just let the internal one not be used. As long as you have a backup, there’s no need to swap the internal in most cases when it goes to read only mode. Once you are sure you have a backup, I might try wiping it so it’s unformatted and free space so you don’t see it mounted or try copying data to it.\nIf you want to store data on the drive you need a repair. Either the drive is gone or the cable and controller can’t be trusted to tell a good drive from a bad one. More likely smart is correct and the drive is done being useful. You would need manufacturer tools to determine that for the specific vendor of that HDD.\n", "Q: Modifiers key does not work This is something that is starting to get in my nerves. Basically I am mapping the Command key to Control key, it is being stressful for me to try the typical combinations (Copy/Cut/Paste) with Command. This menu in settings looks pretty straightforward to change this behaviour but it does not work at all.\n\nWould I need to set up another configuration?\n\nmacOS Monterey Version 12.4\n\nA: You've got the assignment reversed. You want to assign the Control key (which you keep hitting) to the Command function. The way you have it, no key does the Command function, which makes it impossible for you to do cut/copy/paste via keyboard.\nBe careful with this. Depending on your usage, this could create unintended consequences. Command and Control usage aren't simply reversed on Mac compared to PC.\n", "Q: Use Gmail account with iChat? I have used my gmail account with iChat 4.0.8 (Leopard) about 6 months ago. Since then, I've re-installed OSX Leopard, but I can't get iChat working. Whenever I try to log in I get an error.\nMy question is: did I forget how to do iChat login and could someone please help me? -  or does this notice make it impossible to log in anymore?\n\nA: iChat was a messaging app that supported other protocols, so that Yahoo Messenger, Google Talk, AOL Instant Messenger, etc. could all be accessed from one tool.\nHowever, iChat was discontinued in macOS Mountain Lion 10.8, where it was replaced by iMessage, now known as Messages.\nMessages replaced the 'other protocols' with a proprietary, end-to-end encryption system for communication among Messages users, but also supported SMS, incorporating this new mobile phone messaging standard, allowing non-Messages users to be included. Messages does not support Google Talk, AIM, etc.\nMore critically for you, Google announced back in 2017, that on June 16, 2022, they were discontinuing support for third party access to Google Talk. Therefore your use of iChat and Google Talk is no longer supported.\nhttps://support.google.com/talk/\n", "Q: Playing local (on device) music files I have a sizeable CD collection, all of which I've ripped and converted to MP3.  While connected to my home network, I copied many of these files from my Samba NAS share using IOS's built-in files app to the phone itself.  I put all the files in a folder I created named \"Music\".  The copy ended with an error message.  But all the files appear to be there (and they are consuming space on the device).\nNow, how can I play these?  If I browse to the folder in the IOS Files app, and tap on an MP3 file, it just hangs.  I also tried some 3rd party apps: \"Flacbox\", \"Nota Player\", and even good ol' VLC.  With VLC, I can't even see how to access the files I copied.  Both Flacbox and Nota Player hang when I try to import the files.\nFWIW, I am new to IOS, having come from Android.  This process was trivial on Android: copy files (no errors), and there was a great simple, free app I used called \"Folder Player\" expressly for playing local audio media.  How can I achieve a similar result on IOS/iPhone?\n\nA: It appears the answer is the \"sandbox\" design of iOS.  Every app lives it its own little world (\"sandbox\") and has little to no access to files outside that world.  And my understanding is that for device local storage, there really is no notion of a \"common area\" that any app can arbitrarily access.\nTherefore, many of the apps I want to use as a simple folder-based music player can in fact do what I want, but it looks like my music has to be copied directly into the app's folder.  I can either do this through the native iOS Files app, or \"import\" the files into the app through the app itself (depending on the app).  I suspect the apps that appeared to hang were actually just doing the copy/import process.  When I manually copied files using Files, it was quite slow.\n", "Q: My phone was stolen: Is there any way I can recover a backup of Whatsapp from the desktop application which is still linked to the phone?

On my Mac, however, I can still use the Whatsapp desktop app which I had linked to my phone.\nI plan to buy a SIM with the same number and re-install Whatsapp, but I have no backup to restore as I had disabled the backup feature on the phone.\nIs there any way to make a backup from the desktop app? More generally, is there any way I can recover my account conversations/data/images ?\n\nA: No, the desktop version pulls data from the cloud but if you turned off backup on mobile, there's no way to do what you want other than to manually screenshot it, save files that are available, etc.\nDo you have a backup of your phone that you could restore to a new phone? That may do it.\n", "Q: Running MacBook Pro M1 16\" on less than 140 watt charger The MacBook Pro M1 16\" comes with a 140-watt charger, with a MagSafe plug.\nI vaguely recall that such a charger provides rapid charging, but so many watts are not required. I recall that this MacBook Pro can run, without fast charging, on just under 100 watts (98 or 96 W?) with a charger plugged into a Thunderbolt port rather than MagSafe.\nThis lower watt usage is important because if the MacBook Pro 16\" tolerates under 100 watts, it can be powered from a Thunderbolt dock rather than the bundled charger.\nUnfortunately, I cannot find any documentation to this point. The Apple specifications page provides no such details.\nCan anyone confirm my recollection, and provide details or documentation?\n\nA: In general, you can run this MacBook Pro (and others) on very low wattage - because it has a battery. You do not need a 140W charger, or a 100W charger or anything like that.\nHowever, there's a risk that you will drain the battery if your particular use of the laptop makes it consume more power than you can charge the battery with.\nDepending on the particular model of the 16\" MacBook Pro (2021) the maximum power consumption varies a lot. In practice, you'll see a power consumption of about ~5-15W when the laptop isn't doing much, and ~50-100W when you put it to work. If you really stress test the maxed out model while having the display set on max brightness, you will probably be able to reach a maximum power consumption of ~135W.\nSo in essence, for most people having a ~96W charger plugged into a Thunderbolt would be perfectly fine.\n", "Q: Sync iBooks highlights, bookmarks, etc., without uploading epubs to iCloud Drive In the past, it was possible to sync (i)Books bookmarks, highlights, etc., through the cloud, without turning on iCloud Drive for the Books app, or uploading personal epubs (not purchased from Apple) to iCloud Drive. Has this been removed from iOS?\nUsing iOS 9.3.6 for example, it was possible to do this by turning on Settings > iBooks > Sync Bookmarks and Notes, and Sync Collections, while having Settings > iCloud > iCloud Drive > iBooks turned off. Books were not uploaded to iCloud Drive. The highlights etc. were synced using the Apple ID used for iTunes/AppStore/iBooks purchases, which is not necessarily the same as the Apple ID used for iCloud. Books could be synced from the Mac with a cable, with Books disabled in iCloud Drive. The Mac's Books Preferences > General > Sync: \"Sync collections, bookmarks and highlights\" is checked, and highlights and bookmarks were synced through the cloud, in real time.\nI got a new device with iOS 15, and there is only Settings > Books > iCloud Drive, and Reading Now. Below this, it says \"To enable syncing across devices, sign in to iCloud and turn on iCloud Drive in Settings\". I haven't done that, but I think it will trigger the books that I synced with a cable from the Mac, to be uploaded to iCloud Drive, which I don't want. But I can't see how to get the highlights and bookmarks to sync without that - none of the books on the new device have their bookmarks.\n\nA: Yes, it still works, though getting the settings right is tricky and it's not always a 2-way sync. I have it working with 3 devices iOS 9.3.5, iOS 15.6.1 and macOS 10.15.7 with no epubs stored in iCloud.\nNeed to be signed in to the iBooks/Books Store with the same Apple ID on all devices.\nSettings on iOS 9.3.5\n\n*\n\n*In iBooks: Sync bookmarks and Notes - On\n\n*In iCloud drive: iBooks - Off\n\nSettings on iOS 15.6.1:\n\n*\n\n*In Books: Reading Now - On\n\n*In Books: iCloud Drive - Off\n\n*In iCloud: Books - on\n\nSettings on macOS:\n\n*\n\n*In Books: Sync collections, bookmarks, and highlights across devices - On\n\n*In options of iCloud Drive: Books - off\n\nWith these settings, I have a 2-way sync between the Mac and iOS 15.6 and one-way sync from iOS 9.3.5 -> Mac and iOS 15.6.\n", "Q: Reverse scrolling per individual mouse I know this is a thing for mouse and trackpad and I know the application \"Scroll Reverser\".\nWhat I'm looking for is an app that let me set the scroll direction per individual mouse.\nI want my magic mouse to be in the other direction like a mouse with a physical scroll wheel.\nI only use the second mouse with the physical scroll wheel for blender and would like it to be reversed.

I have tried resizing original photos with sips, convert or other programs in bash, and the changes are visible on Photos app. However the metadata is not updated (original is 4000x2000, resized is 640x480 and photos app still shows 4000x2000 while the photo is 640x480).\nThere are a lot of apps that interact with Photos.app like Photo Sweeper, Power Photos, etc. However I couldn't find any that allows to batch resize by editing.\nCouldn't find a way to do that with Automator or applescript although there are scripts interacting with the Photos app.\nSeems a very common use case but I couldn't find any answer on the web.\nTried below suggestions:\n\n*\n\n*Shortcuts on MacOS: the shortcut doesn't show up.

I transferred a presentation from an up-to-date iMac to my Macbook Air and it's changed from the original keynote document to this:\n\n\n\nA: An Apple Keynote document is basically a root folder with the extension .key containing a substructure of folders with Text, Images, Tables, Notes, Media, files, and XML-related data.\nIf the .key-extension is removed, MacOS will show such document package as a folder (with files and subfolders - see screen shot provided by OP).\nTo „reconstitute“/wrap such folder into a Keynote presentation it is often sufficient to add .key as extension to the root folder name.\n", "Q: Boot login screen responsive only a second every minute Description:\nOut of nowhere, the boot login/decryption screen started to become unresponsive.\nFortunately, the screen is responsive for about a second every minute (or so).\nThis way I can still type in my password at 2 chars / min (*o*) and log in.\nOnce logged in, everything is fine. Non-boot logging screens are not affected.\nThe same is the case when booting from an older Mac OS via USB.\nThe closest related problem I could find was macOS Sierra boot problem related to Apple SD Card reader driver.\nBut the described behavior is not a perfect match.

So the SD cardreader is indeed the culprit. Now I only need a way to fix it on the sw side...\n\nA: So, the solution for me was to use the Apple Disk Utility app to run the First  Aid on the offending SD card. I am not sure at which level it makes more sense to run First Aid (Card read / Container / APFS volume), I did all 3 and the issue is now gone (the login screen is responsive).

Longterm macOS user here. German system, never had any contact to any kind of russian language or so. Suddenly my \"Data\" HDD/SSD on 2019 16\" MacBook has a russian name.\nThis looks totally shady to me, has anybody a clue what's going on?\nEDIT: The word means \"Data\" in russian. A quick Bitdefender run says no infections found. I have a dev background, so I'm naturally picky in what I install and where the sources are. No shady software, no unnecessary sudo, the system is mostly default. I mostly work from home (using own wifi), no shady locations.\n\n\nA: With the information given you cannot conclude either way whether you have been hacked.\nIs it normal that the name of a volume suddenly changes its name - no.\nIs the only possible cause of such a name change hacking - no.\nGiven that there is no obvious benefit to a hacker of changing the name of your volume, and that is the opposite of what viruses usually does (i.e. keep low and stay undetected) - it doesn't seem that likely that is is hacking or viruses.\nPerhaps it is some software you have installed that changed the name (also unlikely). You mention that you use the computer to work from home, so it might be a Mac managed by your employer - perhaps they issued the name change.\n", "Q: macOS Mail app: is there a way to prevent local storage? I'd like to use the macOS Mail app for a few different reasons. But each time Mail launches (say, after clicking a mailto: link or if I'm taking a look at app preferences), the app begins downloading 15+ years of Gmail history to my drive. It's not that I don't have the drive space, but I have several practical reasons for keeping the the individual 'file count' of the drive as low as possible (each email is stored as an individual file in Mail's local storage folders).\nGmail's POP function does not have much in the way of settings, though I imagine local (client) settings are what will make the difference here. I do notice that Gmail's IMAP settings have an option to limit client-side folders to 1000 items (at the fewest), but then I cannot use the Mail client to access history older than whatever 1000 files happens to be in a given folder.\nEven if I did go the IMAP route, a 15+ year old Gmail account would make this far from what I'm looking to do (turning local storage off altogether for Mail).\nSo I'm wondering if I just need to keep periodically deleting Mail's local storage folders -- or if someone here knows of a solution before I perhaps send this to Apple/feedback.\nThanks in advance!\np.s. Unlinking this email address from Mail (or finding a workaround in terms of how much is/isn't stored on the server) won't be practical in this case unfortunately\n\nA: This problem is a bit chicken and egg, just like mail app can’t run client based rules on mails it hasn’t downloaded, there’s no “online search” function for  IMAP and gmail and macOS mail.app. I understand why you already considered and disregarded the server side filtering for gmail.\nYou can avoid attachment downloads easily, but you’ll need to migrate this to Outlook and Exchange if you need this functionality. I believe that’s the only viable macOS mail client and server system that implements what you seek here.\nThe only other option is to relocate the Library storage to a drive you don’t mind carrying that volume of files and data so it can work as designed and your volume of mail that exists on the server marked as available to sync.\n", "Q: The \"Find My Mac\" setting will not turn on, despite having gone through Apples instructions carefully... how can I fix this issue? I have followed the instructions here to turn on \"Find My Mac\", but it doesn't work. I have a Macbook Pro 14 inch 2021, with MacOS 12.4 Moneterey installed.

Namely:\n\n*\n\n*I rebooted and tried again\n\n*I booted in Safe Mode and tried, but got the same behavior\n\n*I deleted various *.plist files, rebooted, and tried again\n\nAll without success. I should note that I also have looked on my other devices and they definitely can't see this Mac on the \"Find My\" app. So this is a real failure and not just a UI quirk.\n(Aside: Is there a command line command or tool to enable these settings? I ask because, completely unrelated to this issue and on my work computer, I was able to fix an issue where I couldn't enable screen sharing with Google Meets by running a command line tool.... but that tool was only for Accessibility options.)\nAnyway, I know this is a long shot but hopefully someone is out there who eventually sees this and can answer. I'm going to try to call Apple Support tomorrow and try my luck with them. If I find a solution I'll be back to enlighten y'all.\n\nA: OK! I got it solved. To summarize the things I tried:\n\n*\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Reboot into safe mode\n\n*Sign out and sign back in to your Apple ID in System Preferences\nThat last one is what did the trick for me.

Apple hasn't updated its Root CA list?\n\nThe \"Cisco Umbrella ...\" CA's is not public CA trusted by default. It is instead a CA used for SSL interception by a security product (Cisco Umbrella) used within your company. Typically such CA are automatically rolled out to company managed devices, so that they get trusted.

When I go to check in the dictionary utility if the root user is activated, I confirm that it is not, anyway I activate it again, I change the password again, and I deactivate it again, this did not work, it does not work either to do with the \"guest user\", I have already formatted the entire system and I have done a clean reinstall of the operating system from scratch. But the problem persists, my head begins to formulate strange theories about an application or someone remotely creating that user with root privileges, I read some old posts about it but we are talking about Yosemite, by the way the version of the operating system is: Monterey 12.4 ( 21F79)]1\nI would really appreciate if someone could guide me on what is happening on my login screen.\nEDIT) As I said before, the root user was always disabled and I checked it numerous times, the code proposed by ICONDAEMON worked, in fact, the user “Other…” disappeared, I mean this code:sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED -bool FALSE.

On my MacBook Pro 2015 running macOS Monterey, I'd like to be able to set Adobe Photoshop to automatically save to my Photos.app library as the default location. I'd also like to be able to save to a device folder if desired. Is there a way to do this on Mac?\n\nA: Photoshop will save back to the Photos Library if you send it from there initially.\n\nIf you edit then Save in Ps, the save replaces the one in Photos, seamlessly. I've only tested this with jpg files. I don't use Photos for my 'real' work & don't have RAW, TIF or even HEIC etc in Photos to test.\n\nA: Unfortunately, Adobe Photoshop does not have a built-in feature to automatically save files directly to the Apple Photos Library.\nHowever, there is a workaround that you can try:\n\n*\n\n*In the Photos app, go to Preferences > General and verify that the Copy items to the Photos library option is enabled.\n\n*In Photoshop, go to File > Automate > Scripts > Image Processor.\n\n*In the Image Processor window, choose the folder where your Photoshop file is saved by clicking on Select Folder.\n\n*Make sure the Save as JPEG option is selected, and choose a destination folder for the processed images.\n\n*Click on Run to start the image processing.\n\n*Once the images are processed, go to the destination folder you selected in step 4 and drag the JPEG images to the Photos app. They will be added to your Photos Library.\n\nThis method is not completely automatic, but it does provide a way to easily transfer images from Photoshop to your Photos Library.\n\nA: Adobe Photoshop does not contemplate proper integration with photos as a default save location for all work. It does receive images from the share sheet, so if that’s good enough for your needs, you’re in luck.\nOther apps do a better job of this, but you could also use a native and free tool called Folder Actions.\nYou would set up a folder to which photoshop saves image files (and not binary files like PSD or PSB files) to automatically import the image files to your photos library.\n\n*\n\n*http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/folder-action/index.html\nIf you try this by hand you will quickly decide this process will work for your needs or it will not. If you work on a couple images a week, this is fine. If you have dozens or hundreds of images a week, you will need other options.\nOther excellent apps that work better with photos are in order of preference for that one item:\n\n*\n\n*Pixelmator Pro - https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/tech-specs/\n\n*Acorn - https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\nAll of these applications struggle once you expect layers and multiple undo steps to stay embedded in the image or other advanced features. Photos operates on a more basic “original” and “edited” state and doesn’t really allow for layers and things that Aperture, Lightroom, Capture One, Photo Mechanic and other “pro” tools have baked in.\n", "Q: How to clean iPhone 12+ (IP68) I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and have junk in the lightning port and over the speakers/mics. I'm unable to clean them effectively by using the picking tools I have available. However, I do have a small ultrasonic cleaner that I use to clean my glass and brace. From my experience cleaning these two items as well as other items, the ultrasonic cleaner is really effective at cleaning things that are hard to clean using traditional tools.\nIf I submerge my iPhone into the ultrasonic cleaner (filled with tap water and on) for a prolonged duration (e.g. 5-10 min), will this cause water damage to my iPhone? Is water in an ultrasonic cleaner more \"aggressive\" or more \"invasive\" than ordinally still water when Apple tested iPhone for water resistance?\n\nA: Apple says:\n\nRated IP68 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes) under IEC standard 60529\n\nWhich basically means water resistant. They never claim waterproof and I, personally, would never submerge any electronics in any liquid for the purposes of cleaning it.\nYour best bet would be to try a little compressed air in a can that is commonly used for blowing the dust out of electronics.\nFailing that you can visit fixit.com for disassembly instructions so you can better clean it out. If you are not comfortable doing that I would take it to an independent phone repair place and have them open it up and blow out the dust.\nBut submerge an iPhone in water to clean it? Nope, no, not gonna do it. And I would advise anyone to not do it either.\n\nA: TLDR - when cleaning the whole phone - Avoid getting moisture in any openings, and don't submerge your iPhone in any cleaning agents.\nI couldn’t think of a better way to get water into a phone than your proposed method. Compressed air drives moisture past seals, as will ultrasonic vibrations. This would be worse if it dissolves salts and other corrosive items past all the seals and cracks to ensure they get inside with the water.

Are there system processes that require ruby?\nInstalling gems using the local ruby will generally ask for permissions and most scripts today ask for a newer version of ruby. Apple has historically removed built in interpreters and stated it will remove php, ruby, and perl. Yet has only removed php. As of macOS 12.4, what still uses ruby?\nMacos Catalina Release Notes\n\nA: Why Apple does something is really not possible to answer by any means except by what Apple has officially stated.\nThe answer lies in the document you have linked - here Apple states that they ship Ruby \"for compatibility with legacy software\".\nSo there you have it. Presumably Apple knows that they have customers (probably large ones) that run software that rely on the old Ruby system being there. Removing it would break that software while having only a very marginal benefit of saving some space.\nIf you as the user want to use a newer version of Ruby, you can just install it.\n", "Q: Can't open emoji keyboard in Safari Nowhere in Safari, whether it be in text fields in webpages or in the Safari UI itself (address bar for example), can i show the emoji popup.

I see how the cycles on my MacBook increase every week but I use my Mac from a power adapter about 80% time. And my battery doesn't discharge lower than 70%.\nHow I can fix it? I tried using a power bank, but all of them stop power after 100% and shut down automatically, without supporting low power like a wall charger.\n\nA: One cycle represents a cumulative discharge of 100%. This could be 10 discharges of 10% each.\nIt is therefore entirely normal that cycles will increase with usage, and there is nothing to fix.\nAlso, the cycle count is not a fixed mortality clock, with the battery dying on the count of 1000. It's just an indication of the usage. Some batteries may hold their charge for longer; some may fail earlier.\n\nA: Can you try AlDente? It prevents your Macbook from charging above or below a certain level. While it might not work, since you appear to be having an issue where your power back shuts off when \"power source: power adapter; battery not charging\". But maybe, give it a try. And if you do get the hardware issue fixed & you can keep that state, then AlDente will mean you get 0 cycles on your battery unless you take it off the charger (My macbook ive had for a month has 3 cycles, the exact amount it came with from the store since I use this app).\n\nA: Not sure if this is exactly what you're asking, but I've successfully used both a Xiaomi Mi Power Bank 3 Pro (20,000 mAh) and a Baseus mini JA (30,000 mAh) power bank. The first one has a 45 W USB-C output and would deplete quite quickly if used from USB-C; but note that using the USB-A output with a USB-A to USB-C cable also works, and limits charging current to about 10 or 12 W -- indeed this is how I used the Xiaomi power bank, and in my usage, it didn't actually charge my MacBook Pro, but rather just slowed down (considerably) the rate of discharge. In addition, it took much longer to deplete, as one would expect due to the slower charging rate.\nThe Baseus one has a 15 W USB-C output, a 10 or 12 W USB-A output and a 5 W  USB-A output. I currently use it from the 15 W USB-C output, and again it doesn't charge my MBP but merely keeps it from discharging, or slows the rate of discharge to a crawl. It also lasts very long.\nDo note, however, this is all speaking from the perspective of an Intel 15\" MacBook Pro, which consumes much more energy than, say, a MacBook Air M1. If that's what you have, then the Baseus power bank should be an excellent choice -- the 5 W output should more or less balance the charge and discharge rates, depending on your actual usage patterns, whereas it would take some heavy load to balance a 15 W USB-C output.\nNote that if your goal is to maximize your battery lifespan, you should (as suggested in another answer) use an app like AlDente and limit charging. Batteries age more quickly if they're at high state of charges all the time. Limiting the charge to anything below 100% is better than 100%, even 90% should extend the lifespan, and 80% should have excellent results. 60% extends lifespan the most and is what I personally use -- and note you can temporarily increase it any time if you'll be away from a wall socket for long and need the extra battery life. Anything below 60% makes no sense and will actually start to reduce lifespan again, albeit by a different chemical process than the one that acts on a near-100% charged battery.\n", "Q: How can I selecting JSON File In AppleScript when they appear grayed out in the open dialog?

I have discovered the hard way that Apple's \"Migration Assistant\" doesn't always preserve file timestamps (i.e., created/modified dates in ~/Documents), and I now have a new machine with some folders containing files that are timestamped to the migration — not the original timestamps. It's a mess, and sort of a disaster for my workflow. I've just learned that many others have been burned by this before me.\nQuestion: is there some way that I can use rsync, perhaps with the --size-only flag to restore the original, correct timestamps?\nI need to create an NFS share, I guess, to rsync between two different macs. Or maybe I could do it via ssh?\nIf this is possible, any pointers on how to actually do it?\n\nA: \"I have discovered the hard way that Apple's \"Migration Assistant\" doesn't always preserve file timestamps\"\ncomment: It seems that has become Apple's MO - you must discover all things the hard way.\nCaveats: I'm not entirely sure this will resolve your issue or answer your question, but I hope it will help. I don't actually know what Migration Assistant does because in 12 years and 5 different Macs, I have never used it. So this answer may be a partial answer, or it may be incompatible with Migration Assistant. As a guess, I'd say use rsync after Migration Assistant - to clean up the mess it has left. In other words, rsync can likely restore not only the timestamps lost by MA, it can also restore all file metadata that may have been lost. Others here may have better ideas; my answer will be limited to rsync.\nI used rsync version 3.2.4 for this answer, installed from MacPorts. I do not know if the rsync version included with your version of macOS includes the required options shown here - you may wish to investigate that instead of installing a current version of rsync.\nBackground: I've begun using rsync as my primary backup tool for macOS recently, and had to address some of the same issues as you: mangled and missing metadata. In my case the issue was caused by crossing a file system boundary - from APFS on my local drive to btrfs via SMB on a Synology NAS. In your case - Migration Assistant - I cannot even imagine how it could not even get the timestamp metadata correct, but you're certainly not the only one who's reported such issues.\nI made some notes while working to resolve my issue, and they morphed into a \"recipe\" on my macOS GitHub repo. I'll try to keep this answer rather brief since most of the details are covered in that document.\nrsync with metadata preservation\nrsync effectively copies data from a source (the \"from\" location) to a destination (the \"to\" location). If you are using a fileserver (NAS) as an intermediary between your two Macs, these commands should do what you need. I don't see any need to involve an intermediate NAS, but it may be convenient or desirable if you want a backup. You should be able to accomplish the rsync operations over an SSH connection; the following commands illustrate the syntax & options needed regardless of whether you use the intermediary NAS or not:\nfrom \"old Mac\" to NAS:\nAssuming the source & destination folders are:\nSOURCE: /Users/MyHome/MyData/\nDESTINATION: /System/Volumes/Data/mnt/MyNAS/\nFrom a terminal on your \"old Mac\":\n% SRC-FLDR=\"/Users/MyHome/MyData/\"\n% DST-FLDR=\"/System/Volumes/Data/mnt/MyNAS/\"\n% rsync -rlAXtgoDivv --dry-run --fake-super $SRC-FLDR $DST-FLDR > rsync.log 2>&1\n\nExplanation: This rsync command uses the --dry-run option, and therefore will not actually move or modify any files. It will give you a detailed log (the ivv options) of what files would have been moved or modified. Once you are happy with the results, simply remove the --dry-run option, and run again for effect. Review the rsync.log file using the \"Decoding Table\"\nfrom NAS to \"new Mac\":\nSOURCE: /System/Volumes/Data/mnt/MyNAS/\nDESTINATION: /Users/MyNewMacHome/MyData/\nFrom a terminal on your \"new Mac\":\n% SRC-FLDR=\"/System/Volumes/Data/mnt/MyNAS/\"\n% DST-FLDR=\"/Users/MyNewMacHome/MyData/\"\n% rsync -rlAXtgoDivv --dry-run --fake-super $SRC-FLDR $DST-FLDR > rsync.log 2>&1\n\nfrom \"old Mac\" to \"new Mac\"\nIf you can make an SSH connection between your \"old Mac\" & \"new Mac\", it's not necessary to involve an intermediate NAS. The same rsync options may be used; I'll leave it to you to formulate the SOURCE and DESTINATION folders.\nVerifying Results:\nThe GitHub recipe includes a short zsh script that will stat all of the files, folders, links, etc between the SOURCE and DESTINATION folders. It may be run following rsync operations to verify that at least the chosen stat attributes are the same.\nThe rsync options presented here will do more than preserve the metadata containing the date-time stamps; they will also preserve all extended attributes. The GitHub recipe also includes simple script to compare the output of xattr -lrsvx for all files (that have xattrs) in the SOURCE and DESTINATION directories.\nThe stat utility that I use here is the GNU coreutils version 9.1. The find version I use is the GNU findutils version 4.9.0. Both are readily available through MacPorts, and available for virtually every version of macOS. The xattr command is a macOS utility.\n", "Q: Trying To Run ExifTool From AppleScript In Automator I have a small AppleScript setup in Automator which does the following.\nPrompts user to select a json file\nPrompts user to select a folder\nIt is then supposed to execute Exiftool located in /usr/local/bin but it never runs it.\nhere is the AppleScript code I have in Automator\n--Select JSON File\nset theFile to choose file\nset theFile to POSIX path of theFile\n\n\n--Select Folder\nset theFolderPath to choose folder\nset theFolderPath to POSIX path of theFolderPath\n\n-- Run ExifTool\nset exiftool to \"/usr/local/bin/exiftool -json=\" & theFile & \" \" & theFolderPath\n\n\n-- Display Dialog to see the full command.\n--When I paste the contents into terminal it works !\ndisplay dialog exiftool\n\n-- Run ExifTool\ndo shell script exiftool\n\nThe screenshot below is what I get from displaying the dialog with the full command.

I have a large number of photos on my iPhone that were taken at an event, but only some of them have GPS information. The ones missing the information were airdropped to me by other attendees without the setting to retain this data. I want to copy the GPS information from a photo that has it (e.g., that I took) to the photos that don't have it. I have not been able to find a way to do this. Is there one?\nI want the GPS information to be added to the image files themselves rather than being stored in some other way (as would be the case if I added the information using Google Photos' \"Add location\" feature).\nI'm running iOS 15.5 on an iPhone SE (2nd generation). Any solution based on an iOS app or on something in the cloud should be okay. I don't have access to a Mac. I have a Windows machine.\n\nA: You can do this with any image metadata editor program that allows batch editing. For iOS, see Metadata Pro (I haven't tried this one and there are also other such apps for iOS as well as Windows, so look and choose).

The reason is that if someone manages to read some of your files, for example because they have temporary access to your computer, or because they got hold of a backup, they must not be able to find your password.\nWhen your computer verifies your password, it doesn't just compare the password with a stored reference copy of the password. It first calculates a password hash, then compares the result with the stored reference hash. By design, a password hashing function only works one way: it's impossible to calculate the password from the hash. If you only know the hash, the best you can do is to guess the password and check your guess.\nIf you've forgotten your login password, and you haven't written it down anywhere, the only solution is to change it. (Despite what it often said, writing a password down can be a good idea — but it must be on paper, and the paper must be stored somewhere secure such as a bank safe, not a post-it note in view of your webcam.)\nIf you've partly forgotten your password (e.g. you remember that it's Iloveyou and a number but you don't remember the number — obviously this example is a bad password!), there are tools that can help you crack it. You need to obtain the password hash then assist the tool with everything you know about the password. That's only realistic if you almost remember the password.\nIf you've used the same password for something else, of course, it may be stored somewhere else. If you've used it for a service that you accessed from the Mac, it's probably in your keychain. Of course, if you can't get into the keychain because you've forgotten the password, that's again by design, sorry.\n", "Q: Recover and deduplicate Time Machine backup files I have an old Time Machine backup and would like to recover the latest version of the files without restoring the backup to a whole computer.\nFor example, say that the Time Machine backup drive has two files:\nBackups.backupdb/Drive 1/2008-01-01-080000/Macintosh HD/Users/user/Documents/file1.doc\nBackups.backupdb/Drive 1/2008-01-01-080000/Macintosh HD/Users/user/Documents/file2.doc\nBackups.backupdb/Drive 1/2008-02-01-080000/Macintosh HD/Users/user/Documents/file1.doc\n\nI want to recover this backup with the same folder structure and the latest version of each file, e.g.:\nuser/Documents/file1.doc (from 2008-02-01)\nuser/Documents/file2.doc (from 2008-01-01)\n\nFor a few files and two backups, it's easier to do by hand.

I don't understand the reason for these wrong dates and what caused it or how I can correct them. Is there a way to correct this? Any help is appreciated.\n\n\nA: Presumably your Time Machine volume is not using ExFAT… or it just wouldn't work. ExFAT cannot hold many data types needed by macOS - including extended attributes, access control lists or even basic file permissions -  & should not be used unless portability between Mac & Windows/nix is paramount.\nExFAT is also not a journaled file system, so in the event of a disconnect at write, the entire volume could be lost.\nPersonally, if you need cross-platform compatibility, I would format it HFS+ & install something like Paragon HFS for Windows on any Windows machines that also need to physically access the drive.\nDrive manufacturers tend to ship drives ready-formatted as MBR/ExFAT because it \"works\" on most computers straight out of the box, but it's not the best format for any computer, just the most portable. First thing you should do with any new drive is format it GUID/HFS+ for HDD or GUID/APFS for SSD.\nbtw, the dates you see are a mis-reading or mis-interpretation.

This is expected when each update is a delta even when Xcode does the install (which adds complexity beyond what you require) and not “the whole install whether things change each version or not” type installer.\nIf the goal is minimizing downloads you can set up a local caching service in the future so you only download each update once for the entire network.\n\n*\n\n*What is content caching on Mac?\n\n*Set up content caching on Mac\nAlso, this is often worse on betas where Apple will test updates so you might be part of testing things or the beta packages don’t get seeded globally so you have to do more downloads than once things slow down after general release.\n", "Q: How do I move a maximized window from one monitor to another? I am new to macos and I am not able to move maximized windows from one monitor to another. Is it possible in mac?\nI am using macOS Big Sur, Version 11.3.1.\n\nA: Are both displays the same resolution? [Not the same physical size, that's not important.]\nAre you confusing 'maximised' with 'fullscreen'?\nYou can move any window, maximised or not, by dragging the title bar. You cannot move fullscreen apps this way. You need to invoke Mission Control & drag the mini icon in the large top bar that appears.

Firefox can open pdfs, and for some purposes, it's pdf viewer is advantageous. In particular, the print menu has some options not available elsewhere.\nUnfortunately, it's not registered as a program that reads pdfs. I don't want it as the default pdf viewer, but I do want it on the list of programs that appear when I select \"open-with\".\nHow can I arrange that?\n\nA: You could edit Firefox's Firefox.app/Contents/Info.plist and add <string>pdf</string> e.g in the first CFBundleTypeExtensions array, but that would get ripped-off at the next Firefox update.\nSo instead you may prefer to build a new Automator Application that will open these files in Firefox.\nSo head to Automator, (Applications/Automator), \"New\" -> \"Application\".\nOn the left panel, search for \"Open Finder Items\", double click or drag&drop on the right panel.\nIn the \"Open with\" option, select Firefox.app.\n\nNow is alredy time to export our App (\"File\" > \"Export\").\nThen we go with the Finder to the location where we just exported the App, right-click, \"Show Package Content\" > \"Contents\" and we open Info.plist with our favorite editor (TextEdit should be fine).\nSearch for the string <string>*</string> below CFBundleTypeExtensions and replace it with <string>pdf</string>.\nSave the document and go back to the Finder looking for a pdf file. Right-click, \"Open with\" > \"Other...\" and there select our App.\nFirefox should open said pdf file and our App should appear in the menu:\n\n\nA: This doesn't actually answer the question, as it doesn't add it to the Open With list unfortunately. It only stays in the list if it's set as Default.\nFrankly it's just quicker for a one-off to drop it straight on the Dock icon or right onto any open Firefox page.\n\nYou can do this from Get Info… in the same way as selecting any already-registered app, except you select 'Other…', right at the bottom of the 'Open With:' list.\nOnce the file-picker dialog opens set 'Enable' at the bottom to 'All Apps' & choose Firefox.\nYou can then set 'Change All…' back in the Get Info pane.\n\nAlternatively, for anyone on an OS old enough to still be able to run RCDefaultApp [Mojave or earlier] you can do it in there. SwiftDefaultApps doesn't seem to be able to do it.\n\nA: The short answer is you don’t. The developer of the application registers it (via code) to open file types using Apple SDK and API calls. Then macOS let’s you choose a preferred app from all that support the types of a file.\nAlso, it’s slightly more complicated than just PDF or pdf extension since each file has many types that are mapped in code so the more specific type gets precedence in choosing an app over the more general types that will get consulted if the first choice doesn’t match.\nFirefox is happy to pass PDF to other apps, but I’m not clever enough to find the embedded viewer and see if it can trick it to tell macOS it can open PDF outside the Firefox main app.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/view-pdf-files-firefox-or-choose-another-viewer\nIn the mean time, what happens if you drag that PDF into Firefox windows or the icon?\n", "Q: App Store Review Guidelines - Do they agree with a completely password-protected application?

If your core app functionality is not\nrelated to a specific social network (e.g. Facebook, WeChat, Weibo,\nTwitter, etc.), you must provide access without a login or via another\nmechanism. Pulling basic profile information, sharing to the social\nnetwork, or inviting friends to use the app are not considered core\napp functionality. The app must also include a mechanism to revoke\nsocial network credentials and disable data access between the app and\nsocial network from within the app. An app may not store credentials\nor tokens to social networks off of the device and may only use such\ncredentials or tokens to directly connect to the social network from\nthe app itself while the app is in use.\n\n\nA: You must provide apple fully functional credentials as if they were a customer for them to properly review your app.\nI would focus more on section 2.1 from what I’m seeing you ask for:\n\n2.1 App Completeness\nSubmissions to App Review, including apps you make available for pre-order, should be final versions with all necessary metadata and fully functional URLs included; placeholder text, empty websites, and other temporary content should be scrubbed before submission.

Also, consider if your app is really just a web app and should even be on the store at all if it’s just a portal for existing clients to log in.\nBest of luck with your development efforts.\n\nA: In my experience, there's absolutely no problems in having such an app, where account creation only happens offline.\nAs you mention, you will have to supply Apple with a test account. In my experience, it is not the case that they \"forget\" to ask for that a few times - that's always the first thing they ask for. They might also ask you to do a video recording of the app working as intended.\n", "Q: Selling (sign out) multi-user, several Mac devices securely In our company, we have several Macs and Macbooks. They aren't used anymore, so we want to sell them. The IT department said that we don't know about erasing the devices securely.

Erasing is OK but signing out the accounts is really a mess :(\nAll devices have the same admin account and I can open that admin account on every device (but the linked Apple account is unreachable, I cannot sign out the AppleID, maybe IT can create the linked email address and I can press the Forgot Password option, to get a new Apple account password for that account).

So, is it possible to sign out them via the admin account? or just remove them and sign out from the admin account.\nWhen I search the forums, it mentions only one account. If someone gives an option, it will be really helpful.\n\nA: My best advice is to have one new Mac and install Apple Configurator. No admin account is needed since you have possession of the mac and can control it in Target Disk Mode without making new accounts.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/apple-configurator\nThen you can boot all the Macs in target disk mode and erase them like phones or iPads.

When an app gives me a dialog box (such as an applescript error, a permission dialog, or an unexpected quit), I will not be able to answer it. I can click the buttons, but nothing happens. The dialog will stay (I just drag it into the corner if it doesn't need any action), and the action the button does will not execute. This becomes a real pain because, many times, there is an app asking for permission, and I have to log out, log in, and then ask for that permission again to get it to click. It will click for a few hours after log out & log in, but then it freezes up again. I am running Monterey 12.4. This only started after I used migration assistant to migrate from an Intel iMac to an M1 pro Macbook. This does NOT occur with dialog boxes created by or within apps, but only dialogs created by MACOS\nThese are the types of dialog boxes I am talking about:\n\n\n\nHowever, dialog boxes like this (not draggable, and stuck inside the app's window, not a separate window) never freeze:\n\nEdit: this is not related to any particular app. My apps all work fine.

The script runs a number of backup-related tasks. After upgrading to Monterey, the task no longer starts at its scheduled time.\nI use Lingon X to control it. When I run it manually from Lingon X as a \"test\", it starts, but sometimes does not finish. When I run the command from the terminal, the job starts and always runs to completion.\nHere is the plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Disabled</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>PATH</key>\n        <string>/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Applications/jas/Keybase.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin:/usr/local/sbin</string>\n    </dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>RH-backup</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/opt/local/bin/php</string>\n        <string>/Users/jas/Websites/RepHunter/cron/RH-backup.php</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/Volumes/Backup1/RH-backup/dbtemp/stderr.log</string>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/Volumes/Backup1/RH-backup/dbtemp/stdout.log</string>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>Hour</key>\n            <integer>6</integer>\n            <key>Minute</key>\n            <integer>0</integer>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n    <key>StartOnMount</key>\n    <false/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThere is never any output in either stderr.log or stdout.log.\nThe only suspicious pattern is that it appears that when started manually, the job often quits after a certain interval. Since the executable is a php script, the first thing I checked was whether the script was timing out.\nAs a test, I added set_time_limit(900) to the php script. That should not matter, as per the php documentation the script timeout does not include the time when system calls are made. The purpose of the script is to make numerous systems calls. So it should not be consuming a lot of run time on its own.\nPlus this script has be working for several years without any such issues.\nAny ideas?\nEDIT 1:\nAfter further testing I discovered some problems, but not the solution.\n\n*\n\n*Having the StandardOutPath and StandardErrorPath prevents the launchd job from running. We were thinking that it was because those paths were set to external drives was causing a problem. We just removed them completely. The script then runs.\n\n\n*The script runs and calls all the external commands. There are a couple of calls to rsync to copy some files around including from remote servers. That works fine.\n\n\n*Then the script calls duplicity to extract a file from the backup set. Duplicity immediately exits without extracting the file. That makes the rest of the functions in the script pointless.\n\n\n*When the script is run from the command line, it always works as expected. It also worked as expected as a launchd job for over two years under Mojave and Catalina. Only after the upgrade to Monterey did the script lose its ability to write files.\n\n\n*As a test, I gave Full Disk Access to duplicity. That makes no difference.\n\n\n*Workaround is to run the script manually from the command line. That always works.\nWhy does Monterey block launchd jobs from writing files?\nEDIT 2:\n\n*\n\n*As another test, I moved all of the intermediate files into /tmp/ with the hope that if a permissions issue might be revealed. That did not help.\n\n\n*I added capturing of error output for the duplicity command.

Since I cannot control anything of the backup, how can I solve the problem?\n\n\nA: Your iCloud stores only photos and data. It does NOT store the apps themselves. Therefore, if you have a lot of apps, the apps + iOS can take up more than what you have on your phone. If I were you, I would click the \"Enable\" next to \"optimize photos - save 112 gb.\" This will keep low-resolution copies of old photos on your phone, and keep the high-quality images in iCloud. When you access old photos, the high-quality version of the photo you access is downloaded, stored, and deleted after you don't access it for a period of time (say, around 14 days or a month). This will surely make enough space for everything else you have, and you wont even notice the difference (I turned this setting on last week, and I didn't notice anything - just know that you might have slightly higher mobile data usage if you tend to watch LOTS of old videos on mobile data, but this shouldn't matter too much for the average person).\n", "Q: Can I delete this extra Macintosh HD - Data partition?

This is usually done in the shell prompt configuration on the remote.  You also configure the local to set the window title, so that when the ssh session ends, the title is not set to the remote any longer.\nHere's an example:\n# xterm titlebar\n\nTITLEBAR=$(printf '\\033]0;')\nBELL=$(printf '\\007')\n\n# set prompt\n\ncase $TERM in\n    # xterm and variants, set the titlebar\n    xterm*) PS1='${TITLEBAR}[\\u@\\h]${BELL}\\h \\$ ' ;;                                                                    \n\n    # anything else, don't try to set the titlebar\n    *) PS1='\\u@\\h \\$ ' ;;                                                                                         \nesac\n\n\nThe TITLEBAR escape code tells the terminal the shell is running in that it should set the titlebar to the text that follows.  You end the string with a BELL.\nThe case statement is a simplistic test for whether or not the terminal the shell is running in is an Xterm or compatible.\nThe particular backslash escapes your shell supports for prompt information (hostname, username, the time, etc) are spelled out in its documentation.\nYou may find the BASH Prompt HowTo useful.\n\nA: You can do it with its Shell Integration feature.

The iPhone will usually be on WiFi while in the EU (in addition to the local SIM card/phone network). I'm ok with missing forwarded calls while the phone is not on WiFI (if relevant).\n\nA: You could just set up forwarding directly but  you would be paying international Verizon rates for the forwarded calls even when on wifi.\nYou could transfer the number to Google voice and run the Google voice app on your phone along with Google hangouts.

In this context, it's usual to talk about the \"execute bit\" to describe whether a file is executable.\nTo see the mode of a file, simply run ls -l: the mode is coded in the  first block of information displayed. For example, if you run ls -l /bin/cp, you will see that the output looks similar to this:\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   152672 May  9 23:30 /bin/cp\n\nIn the example above, -rwxr-xr-x is the file mode, which in this particular case makes the file readable and executable for all, and writable for the owner, that is, the root user.\nFor more information on file modes and how to interpret them, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod.\n\nA: ~/Desktop is a protected folder.\nxargs can't read the script, that's what \"Operation not permitted\" means.\n$ # terminal does not have full disk access...\n$\n$ echo abc | xargs -n1 -I{} ~/Desktop/scripts/test.sh\nksh: /Users/mwilson/Desktop/scripts/test.sh: cannot open [Operation not permitted]\n$\n$ # give terminal full disk access...\n$\n$ echo abc | xargs -n1 -I{} ~/Desktop/scripts/test.sh\ntest!\n$\n\nGive xargs the power to read the script or don't store the script in a protected folder.\n\nA: I'm not sure why (since I am not too familiar with zshell, bash, and so on), but it seems I had to call script.sh from bash. i.e.:\nfswatch -o ~/Desktop/iosBuildZips | xargs -n1 -I{} bash ~/Desktop/scripts/script.sh\n\nNow the commands in script.sh actually execute when there is a change in ~/Desktop/iosBuildZips.\n", "Q: Files in \"Revert to\" stored?

System Preferences, Control Center, and running bluetoothd all show that Bluetooth is disabled, yet the phantom connection persists.\nThis behavior started occurring after I did a clean install of macOS Monterey in October 2021, and has persisted across subsequent updates (currently running macOS 12.4).\nI solve this by toggling Bluetooth on and back off, after which the keyboard is disconnected (and will connect to my other MacBook Pro). But I'm baffled by this \"phantom\" Bluetooth connection, and would love ideas on how to investigate this further.\n\nA: Some ideas for why it's connecting, despite Bluetooth disabled:\n\n*\n\n*iOS, and perhaps macOS, will automatically re-enable Bluetooth/Wi-Fi after something like 24 hours, if you disable it from the Control Center. Go into Settings to actually disable it.\n\n*The Bluetooth state machine is very complicated; in this case, note that the keyboard/trackpad can also remember their sides of the connection, and may attempt to reconnect to whichever MacBook has a stronger signal at the time.\n\n*\n\n*For troubleshooting purposes, you could try resetting the keyboard and trackpad, so they forget about their paired connections.\n\n*There's potentially a sort of ping-pong effect where you wipe one side of the Bluetooth connection, the other keeps re-instantiating it, and the connection's never fully cleared out. One way to avoid this is to keep the Bluetooth peripherals off, reset the macOS Bluetooth stacks, and then factory reset the keyboard/trackpad before turning them back on.\n\n\n\nNote that the above steps are all about fixing Bluetooth specifically; it sounds increasingly unlikely that Bluetooth is the issue here. The part with \"multi-touch gestures don't work\" is probably a large clue; I'd suspect KVM-type software at work, since a lot of programs don't bother/are unable to transport multi-touch gestures correctly.\n", "Q: M1 Ultra won't sleep properly (fan goes off.

Going on right now.\n", "Q: Is formatting external drive with \"APFS Encrypted\" redundant for Time Machine with \"Encrypt backups\" turned ON I got a new external SSD drive to use as a Time Machine on my new MacBook Air M1.\nI formatted that new SSD with a single partition on the format of APFS Encrypted, and assigned a password.\nI went to System Preferences > Time Machine in macOS Monterey 12.4. In the file picker to choose a drive, at the bottom of the dialog is a checkbox reading Encrypt backups, turned on by default.\n Is this encryption option within Time Machine redundant as I already have the APFS file system encrypted?\nIs having both APFS encrypted and Time Machine encrypted harmless but costing in performance as everything is being encrypted twice?\nWhat is the recommended configuration, APFS not-encrypted with Time Machine option \"Encrypt backups\" enabled?\nApple provides the support page, Keep your Time Machine backup disk for Mac secure. But it does not exactly address my question.\n\nA: Time Machine changes APFS to APFS (Case-sensitive, Encrypted)\nIn answer to the title question: Yes, the original encryption is replaced and hence redundant.\nWith encrypted APFS, the whole drive or even partition is not encrypted. The disk hierarchy (as viewed from Disk Utility) is 1) physical drive, 2) APFS container/partition, and 3) APFS volume(s). Encryption is for each APFS volume.\nWhen choose an existing volume (encrypted or not) for Time Machine, it will erase the volume and create a new APFS volume with the same name. The new volume can, optionally, be encrypted.\nEncrypting both is harmless, but it does not encrypt twice. Rather the Time Machine encryption replaces the first encryption. So there is no performance penalty.\nAnd finally and as you suggest, the simplest way is to:\n\n*\n\n*Create a non-encrypted APFS volume.\n\n*Choose that volume when prompted in Time Machine.\n\n*Tick the Encrypt backups checkbox.\n\nAfter Time Machine performs its first backup, choose File > Get Info in the Finder for that external drive, or examine in the Disk Utility app. You will see the format has been changed from APFS to APFS (Case-sensitive, Encrypted).\nJust as a note, many of the \"Related\" links in the righthand sidebar are out of date as they refer to HFS+ formatted Time Machine disks.\n", "Q: Is there any place in which I can dig into the Hypervisor Framework source? So far I've been looking into XNU source, the official Open Source site and the only documentation I found for it. In any case I wasn't able to really find something I can use for understand the internals of the Hypervisor Framework implemented in Swift and not in C.\nI'm actually trying to write my own container runtime from scratch (for learning purposes) so if Apple open sourced this I hope to learn from that specific code base. I don't want to use something like qemu or libvirt (I want to feel the pain of implementing it from the ground up).\nI wasn't able to find clues on the Xhyve sources.\nSo anything regarding docs for the internals, sources or whatever (deep knowledge) about the Hypervisor Framework will be really appreciated. BTW I was searching for C sources cause I want to use Rust and as you may know C & Rust are very interoperable.\nHas Apple open sourced this portion of the code or published any notes on a code base they used for this effort?\n\nA: The Hypervisor framework itself is not open-source - as such, you cannot get a copy of the source code for it (unless you happen to have an agreement with Apple for this purpose).\nIf you really wanted to examine how it specifically works, you could reverse engineer (disassemble) the binary to extract that knowledge. However, usually there is no point in doing so.\nThe corresponding kernel support for the HyperVisor framework is visible in the publicly available XNU source code. Note that here it is known under the name \"hv\". For example take a look here:\nhttps://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/a1babec6b135d1f35b2590a1990af3c5c5393479/osfmk/kern/hv_support_kext.c\nFor learning purposes, I would recommend not trying to reverse-engineer the Hypervisor.framework, but instead just look at the source code (and all sorts of books, tutorials, courses, etc. available) for other hypervisors. It is generally extremely well documented and learning resources are readily available on how to make a hypervisor - for example using the Intel VT-X instructions.\nIf this wasn't for learning purposes, I wouldn't recommend implementing this part of the hypervisor yourself. Instead I would base container system on Apple's Hypervisor.framework, if you want to control and customize the rest of the system yourself (i.e. everything that is not the CPU), and I would recommend Apple's Virtualization framework if you want a relatively standard system and do not require customization of peripherals.\nOne of the main benefits of using Apple's frameworks (besides them being easy to use) is that you can make use of them from sandboxes apps in the App Store - and you do not need to maintain a kernel extension yourself - with all the practical issues they bring for users on modern macOS.\n", "Q: Is there a way to prevent macOS's archive utility from unarchiving inner zip files? I have a zip file, within it I have another zip file, and within that file I have a txt file. When I unzip the outermost file with Apple's archive utility, it unarchives the inner files automatically. Is there a way to prevent this from happening?\n\nA: The Archive Utility has a Prefs panel - though it's not obvious how to get there.\nThe app itself is in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications. Go to that folder, launch the Utility by double-clicking, then under the app name in the menu bar, choose Preferences.\n\nUncheck 'Keep expanding if possible'.\nThere is a way to expose this pref panel in the regular System Preferences Panel, which needs something like TinkerTool to activate.\n", "Q: Sort iOS Photos by metadata (to remove imported WhatsApp media) Migrating from an Android phone to an iPhone, I attempted to automatically transfer camera photos across. Unfortunately, this also imported unwanted media from other applications (e.g. WhatsApp). How can I disentangle this?\nIs there a way to select and group media by their camera metadata, either in iOS Photos or iCloud Photos or elsewhere?\n\nA: There seems to be a few basic avenues to consider.\nNative apps\nThere is an Apple design philosophy of simplifying the UI by limiting the user to pre-defined actions, though internally those actions range from basic to very sophisticated. So for example, iOS Photos can view the basic camera metadata for a photo, and can search by visual recognition (e.g. grouping by person), but apparently cannot search by basic camera metadata. One hack is that the map (or searching by country) does provide a count of how many of the photos (or other media) have location metadata (which generally distinguishes camera photos from media received in WhatsApp etc), but there seems to be no functionality to \"select all\" or to \"invert\" that selection.\nThe iCloud Photos web app seems more limited than even iOS Photos.\nThe macOS Photos application offers some additional features, particularly \"smart albums\" defined by more complex customisable criteria (including various string matching rules applied to the camera metadata). It also supports \"select all\" (say, to delete all items in the smart album).\nA potential obstacle is that using macOS Photos expects a computer that belongs to the same Apple ID as the phone (which can't be taken for granted, esp. since the user is migrating from non-Apple devices). Specifically, since shared albums are so limited, requires permission to add an account to a macOS computer.\nScripting\nIn principle, you could solve this problem using iOS Photos by inspecting the info for each item in the library individually, and on the basis of that camera information, adding the item to a corresponding album (and then potentially deleting it). It may be possible to automate using the iOS Shortcuts app, although (with lack of debugging environment) this seems at risk of creating further messes.\nTransfer\nFor PC and Android, you would simply plug the phone into the computer, navigate to the folder containing the media, and apply more flexible tools.\nApple tries to treat photos (and related media) differently than ordinary files, and so the phone does not expose the photos on the filesystem that is mounted over usb. (Perhaps it is relying on being able to maintain the files in coordination with a separate database file?) It is possible to sync photos to a folder, but only if iCloud is disabled, and some metadata (including \"live\" photos) may be lost over round trips.\n", "Q: How do I delete additional windows in Mail on iPad? [1]Somehow Mail in ipados15 shows multiple windows.\nHow do I close unwanted windows?\nIn Mail on startup it shows a number of \"windows\" towards the bottom of the screen.\nClicking the double box icon shows a number of windows - there is an option to create a new window but there seems to be no option to close them.\nIn normal operation the other window appears \"behind\" and the list of Mailboxes and list in selected Mailbox no longer fills screen - the unwanted window appears behind.\nNOTE the screenshot only shows the front window  - the unwanted window appears behind and to the right.\n\n\nA: Use multitasking on your iPad (Apple):\n\n...swipe up on a thumbnail in the shelf to close that window\n\n", "Q: How to disable key speaking of keyboard I have enabled by mistake (I don't know how) a functionality that speaks every key that I press on keyboard.

Also uncheck any of the other check boxes in the right pane (see screenshot) that are checked.\n\nMore details here.\n", "Q: Can apps with \"Files and Folders\" permission read all my personal files from my iphone? Can apps with \"Files and Folders\" permission read all my personal files from my iphone?\nI was recently digging through settings on my iphone and noticed the \"access to Files and Folders\" permission. It is understandable that some apps need to be able to store data as files, but it got me wonder, if that permission allows apps to access all files or only files created by these apps. For example, if I store some financial contracts in my icloud, synchronized to my iphone, and some apps have permission to \"Files and Folders\" - should these contracts be considered as \"leaked\"?\n\nA: Your files are probably not leaked, but it depends on details we don’t know to make a better call.\n\nIn general, apps can’t read any files in any other application. Say you have an application that makes notes and you store your government ID number, private phone and salary / banking details in it. No other app can see the files made by that app even if you allow other apps to see your “contacts, photos, files.”  Then you get a second app for school notes and store class notes. It won’t see the banking files nor will the banking notes app see the school notes storage.\nThere are two exceptions to this Apple designed sandbox (setting aside bugs and security issues which do happen and then get patched by Apple once they realize a mistake):\n\n*\n\n*Apps from the same developer can ask for a shared storage. Think Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. Rather than have a sandbox with only word files and a sandbox only with excel files, they can be in a “shared pool”. But word won’t see apple Pages files and vice versa.\n\n*Integrations - if the apps connect to cloud storage or to the “files” app, then they can read files that are in the common storage sandbox that use the files storage API.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/view-and-modify-files-and-folders-iphc61044c11/ios\nEven this exception is limited, since the apps don’t run in the background all the time indexing and snooping, you are involved in granting access and they have to be very determined to siphon all the files bit by bit each time you run them and then do whatever bad things they may want to do.\nAll other file sharing is when you push a file from one app and have it land in another app. That doesn’t share any file other than the one you push, and that is a copy of the file, not a link back to the original. Think of sending a photo from photos to messages. You tap and use the share to send a duplicate or perhaps stripped down version of a photo based on settings.\nSince the iPhone 1.0 the storage is and has been highly controlled and segmented to secure things in ways computers could, but don’t generally secure as well.\nIf you want to learn more about the platform security , this site lets you read chunks and then dive very deep if you wish into specifics.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/security/welcome/web\n", "Q: I was dumb enough to fall for a phishing scam, and wondering does he have my codes in my Google Authenticator from my iPhone So I believed a guy saying he was from Apple on the phone (so dumb of me) and he stole my AppleID and tricked me into creating a new one I then push everything to iCloud. He soon downloaded it onto his phone, change my AppleID password, and locked me out.  I lost a lot of stuff because of this. I was too slow to freeze all my assets, and he took a chunk. I changed all my passwords, but wondering does he have a copy of my Google Authenticator too.  And can gain access to my stuff again. If anyone can give me an answer it would be great because Apple says they don't know.\n\nA: He should not be able to access your Google Authenticator codes given the scenario you have outlined.\nGoogle Authenticator works completely offline, so while making sure that you have complete control over your Google Account is important, it won't give you control over the Authenticator as such.\nGoogle Authenticator codes are not included in a non-encrypted backup, and they're not synced over iCloud. Therefore restoring such a non-encrypted backup from iTunes, or syncing another device with your iCloud account will not give the scammer access to your Authenticator codes.\nEven having access to an encrypted backup or by restoring a new device from your stored iCloud backup should not give access to your codes. When you added them to your phone originally, they're stored in a way that is tied to that specific hardware device.\nThe only way to export the codes is to have the original device running, select the Export option and get the codes as QR-codes that can be scanned with a seperate device.\n", "Q: Change mouse settings via terminal I want to reverse the scroll for my USB (Microsoft) mouse on MacOS Monterey.

Your script might not be doing it well either. I'd try pip3 install --upgrade certifi\nYou might also check that your Python 3 script is finding the Python binary you think it's finding. Do a which python3 and then try calling that Python 3 and passing it the script - e.g. something like /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/offlineimap Also have a look at the top of offlineimap to check the shebang at line 1.\nFinally the offlineimap web site says it supports being installed with pip so you could uninstall the Homebrew version and install it with pip3 install --user offlineimap (This will currently install version 7.3.4)\n", "Q: How can I allow ONLY iMessage (and not web browsing) through a firewall?

In the app's preferences, I can only see a full on/off checkbox.\n\nA: Source: If you see 'Unable to load remote content privately' at the top of an email\nThe short answer appears to be no.

Strictly this is the name on the developer certificate which may not obviously be the developer.\nThat is not the name of the application, so this needs a bit of exploration.\nWeb search hints that maybe there should be a space as in \"Yun Li\", in which case you may have one of these apps: Hao Li in App Store.\nAdded later: I performed the translation above on a Mac running Ventura beta build 22A5295i. When I repeat this on Monterey 12.4, the translation is \"Hao Yun Li\" with the extra space.\nAlternatively have a look at the plist files in /Library/LaunchDaemons.

On my iPad/iPhone, I have been searching for a solution for viewing text files from websites that do not offer a .txt extension when clicking to view a document.  A filename is provided, but without any extension.\nSafari will download the file but not view the file.\nSaving the file to downloads and attempting to open in Files app doesn't work, because Files app won't let me rename the D/L to add a .txt extension / file type.\nUp until today, my workaround was to copy the downloaded file from Files to the DropBox app, which does let me rename the file and view it.  Unfortunately, it's a lot of extra steps, which take an excessive amount of time to complete.  And I have to do this a lot.  :-(\nToday, I managed to make a Shortcut that lets me view the file after downloading.\nIt is still an imperfect solution.  I'd like some help with the following two desired behaviors / enhancements.\n\n*\n\n*I would like the Shortcut to be a top-level choice in the Files app actions.  So far I have only been able to add the shortcut to the Share menu, so it's an extra step to access.  I did already set the \"Show in Share Sheet\" and \"Use As Quick Action\" but the latter is under a \"Mac\" heading, which I take to mean won't be applicable on iPad.\n\n\n*I would like to be able to long-press on the link and have the shortcut view the contents of the file, directly, without having to download and switch to the Files app.  I can invoke my Shortcut from Safari, but it doesn't show the contents of the (untyped) text file, it just shows the download URL.  Perhaps I need an altogether different Shortcut for this use case?\nHere is the shortcut:\n[View as Text Shortcut] (https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/164de95d38eb41e5945411bf50473427)\nScreenshot:\n\nFor the input types, I chose, the following:\n\n*\n\n*Files\n\n*Text\n\n*Rich Text\n\n*Safari web pages\n\n*URLs\n\nAnyone have a solution to the above two \"enhancements\" or a better overall solution?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: This is a vexing issue—switching from a Mac to an iPad Pro as my workhorse machine, I’ve found you can do nearly anything, but streamlining the workflow to get there, as you can on macOS (which, being an open Unix, is generally malleable, unlike the locked-sandbox iOS/iPadOS) is often just not possible.\nFirst, the good news: a near-future (as of this writing, 14 Jul 2022; I’ll make a note to edit this later) iPadOS ≥ 16 fix is coming: changing file extensions directly in the Files app. That should mean that the “Save File” action in Safari should let you change the extension as well as it currently allows you to change the base filename by tapping on it—though I don’t have the iPadOS 16 preview, so can’t say for sure.\nIn the meantime, I suspect a Safari extension (which are now available on iPad, though the number actually on the App Store is still quite small even over a year after the feature debuted) could do this, but I’m not sure.\n(I don’t have a background in browser request handling so glancing at the documentation I can’t even see where to start. If you do know your way around JavaScript browser code, the Xcode documentation may make more sense to you—it seems like they’ve used the same nomenclature for framework APIs. There are tutorials that make writing iOS/iPadOS Safari extensions seem fairly straightforward if you know your way around Xcode. But unless you’re very familiar with Xcode and browser request handling, it’s probably easier to just wait for iOS/iPadOS 16.)\n\nA: Made an attempt at enhancement #2, but unfortunately each variation of reading a webpage via the Safari action or the Get Contents of URL action runs outside the context of Safari, which means the retrieval lacks my session state + cookies.

I am using python 3.10. When I run from pycharm, it is using performance cores to render my videos. But when I moved to crontab to schedule this task, it is running on efficiency cores which is taking 3 - 4 times the normal time.\nHow can I force the python script to run on performance cores?\n\n\nA: I believe this is the inverse of this question.  Cron itself is running on efficiency cores because it's a background task, and your Python script inherits its priorities.  taskpolicy is a front-end to the setpriority and getpriority APIs, which, luckily, are exposed to Python directly, so you should be able to import os; os.setpriority(...).  The specifics of the parameters you need to pass are probably specific to your particular application though; it looks like you've got a bunch of processes and you want to run at a high priority, so read the relevant documentation and see if adding to your script will enable you to re-elevate your own task priority from the background.\nNote this language from man setpriority on macOS, all emphasis mine:\n\nAdditionally, the current thread or process can be placed in a background state by specifying PRIO_DARWIN_THREAD or PRIO_DARWIN_PROCESS for which. Only a value of zero (the current thread or process) is supported for who when setting or getting background state.  prio is either 0 (to remove current thread from background status) or PRIO_DARWIN_BG (to set current thread into background state).  When a thread or process is in a background state the scheduling priority is set to the lowest value, disk IO is throttled (with behavior similar to using setiopolicy_np(3) to set a throttleable policy), and network IO is throttled for any sockets opened after going into background state.  Any previously opened sockets are not affected.  The getpriority() call returns 0 when current thread or process is not in background state or 1 when the current thread is in background state.  Any thread or process can set itself into background state.\n\nNote that the DARWIN values, i.e. PRIO_DARWIN_PROCESS, are platform-specific constants that are not exposed by Python, so I wrote a brief C program to extract them:\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <sys/resource.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    printf(\"PRIO_DARWIN_THREAD %d PRIO_DARWIN_PROCESS %d PRIO_DARWIN_BG %d\\n\", \n           PRIO_DARWIN_THREAD, PRIO_DARWIN_PROCESS, PRIO_DARWIN_BG);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nand then I wrote this Python script to illustrate how to use them, which alternates between background and foreground modes:\nfrom os import setpriority, getpid\n\nPRIO_DARWIN_THREAD  = 0b0011\nPRIO_DARWIN_PROCESS = 0b0100\nPRIO_DARWIN_BG      = 0x1000\n\nfrom time import time\n\nfrom itertools import cycle\n\nseconds = float\n\ndef burn_cpu(how_long: seconds) -> None:\n    start = time()\n    while time() < (start + how_long):\n        pass\n\nfor (human, machine) in cycle([(\"background\", PRIO_DARWIN_BG),\n                               (\"foreground\", 0)]):\n    print(\"in\", human, getpid())\n    setpriority(PRIO_DARWIN_PROCESS, 0, machine)\n    burn_cpu(60.0)\n\nI ran it as python3 backgroundr.py & python3 backgroundr.py & python3 backgroundr.py & python3 backgroundr.py in my terminal to ensure that it was using enough parallelism to properly show up on the CPU usage graph, then took this screenshot illustrating it very clearly moving between the performance cores and the efficiency cores:\n\n", "Q: Reverse Quarantine Application I used the following Terminal command to Quarantine a test app I have been making which worked fine\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Untitled.app\n\nIs there a way to bring it back to its original state ( reverse the quarantine ) so when it runs I get the usual message.\n\n\nA: This is a duplicate of this question: How to set (restore) the com.apple.quarantine attribute?\nThis is the summary of the top answer (currently):\n\nYou can copy an existing com.apple.quarantine attribute of an arbitrary file to a proxy file and then apply it to arbitrary other files.

It's not your fault that you simply tried to use this basic feature of the operating system.\nDefinitely your laptop restarting itself without warning is a bad sign.  If you still can, I would recommend making a time machine backup as soon as possible so you don't lose your data, and taking your device to the genius bar.\nI can't say more without having examined the machine closely (and even then, I personally probably couldn't, I'm not a hardware expert) but the machine restarting sounds like a bad sign, like it's hit some bad hardware in some part of that 99th percentile of disk which is causing a crash.\n", "Q: Is there a way to correctly set \"media kind\" in Apple Music 1.2.4.3? I just bit the bullet and updated my Mac OS from 10.14.6 to Monterey 12.4.\nImporting my old iTunes library from the xml file worked fine...mostly.\nThe problem is, I had a ton of TV shows, movies, and audiobooks.  In the old iTunes, they were all correctly tagged with the proper media type.\nIn the new \"Music\" app, when I go to \"get info\" and find the \"media type\" dropdown, there is exactly one entry that I can select.  It's either \"music\" or \"music video\" depending if the selected item is an audio file or a video file.\nNeedless to say this is a MAJOR regression, and also makes shuffle completely unusable as it will shuffle in all tracks from all audiobooks along with all songs.\nHow can I fix this?  Is my only option to delete all the audiobooks and non-music videos from my \"Music\" app library?  Or is there some hack I can use to correctly identify non-music media files while still having everything in the one app like the old iTunes app?\nIncidentally I also haven't yet attempted to sync my iPod Touch (last generation) with my computer; I don't know how that will go.  Links or advice welcome on this point.  Not the end of the world if I can't sync TV shows, movies and audiobooks to it anymore, but it will probably push me away from Apple devices for the future.\n\nA: Audiobooks are now supported in the Books app. Music, as you'd guess by the name, just does music.\niTunes used to try and do everything (poorly IMHO), and Apple eventually listened to the various opinions re. bloat, and split the various functions into separate apps, hence Music, Books, Podcasts. This allows a proper UI for each media type.\nSeparate your Audiobooks from your Music library and import them to Books. They can then be synced to an iOS device by enabling sync in the Finder panels that appear for your device when it's plugged in.\nIf you have purchases from Audible, they are supported in the macOS Books app by authorising your computer on the Audible website. That authorisation carries over to Books on your iOS device also, but there's also the Audible app on iOS which may offer a better experience. See:\nhttps://help.audible.com/s/article/how-to-listen-to-audible-audiobooks-with-the-apple-books-app?language=en_US\nNote. If you use iCloud you'll find that while EPUBs and PDFs added to Books will automatically sync (when enabled) to your iOS device via iCloud, it appears Audiobooks do not, and thus have to be synced via Finder.\n", "Q: My macbook doesn't turn on by attempting lot of times I am having a issue with my Macbook where it doesn't turn on (power-on) randomly, And turns on randomly by attempting lot of times to open it, what issues could I be possibly be facing?

Am I missing something? Surely there’s a way to join the two…?\n\nA: Tl;dr: Its not possible. Your macbook is too new to support SENDING target display mode to another mac. Your iMac is too old to support RECEIVING airplay.\nThis is not possible. As stated in this apple support article, the device projecting to the iMac in target display mode must be made before 2019. Target Display mode will not project to the iMac with your new MacBook pro-2021.\nAirPlay only works for devices released after 2019. This means, funnily enough, your iMac can project its display onto your MacBook, since the 2013 iMac supports airplay, and your new MacBook can act as an airplay receiver. But alas, this most likely has no practical use to you.\nMy recommendation is to get a cheap 1440p monitor & just use that. If you want the quality of an iMac display & your techy, get an iMac with a failed motherboard but a working display & buy a converter board for the display online (such as ebay). This will allow you to connect to your iMac display via HDMI.\n**Note: the link to the converter board I have provided is not guaranteed to work. I have done no research to find out if this works with 2013 iMacs. You must do your own research and verification if you want to buy a converter board.\n", "Q: How to force quit a frozen system command prompt that asks for permissions?

I have another adapter without DAC but that one doesn't even get recognized by my Mac. I often work on my Windows partition (Bootcamp) and it works flawlessly, plug and play, so it clearly isn't a hardware issue. I don't use the 3.5 mm port because I get cracking noise from it.\nI am on the 2018 13\" MacBook Pro, with Monterey version 12.4.\n\nA: Given your description I would agree this is a software issue.  The problem appears that macOS lacks the correct drivers for your Samsung adapter.  The only solution may be to get a different adapter since it is unlikely anyone is going to fix this driver issue.  The Apple USB-C to 1/8\" adapter works for me in macOS and Windows (as well as Linux) and so should work for you.  Given the adapter is listed for $9 this isn't a huge investment to test the theory and possibly resolve the issue.\nI can sympathize with the audio quality issues on the 1/8\" jack as they are known to wear out or get damaged easily, and can pick up noise from within the computer.  Apple does very well in making durable hardware but that doesn't mean things will never break.  I've dealt with this myself and found USB audio adapters a simple and inexpensive solution.  What I have not seen before myself is a software issue like you describe.\nI'd recommend the Apple adapter.  Apple describes it as a solution for iPads and iPhones but it appears to work just fine on macOS and Windows computers as well.  Any adapter should work but as you discovered should does not mean it will.\n", "Q: Hidden files showing in finder, but not in terminal I'm setting up a new Mac running Monterrey 12.4.\nI've used the standard method of the following terminal command:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles true; killall Finder\n\nThis doesn't allow me to see hidden files in terminal, only in Finder.\nHow can I always show hidden files when I use ls in the terminal?\n\nA: How can I always show hidden files when I use ls in the terminal?\nYou could add something like alias ls='ls -a' to one of your startup scripts.  Be careful though, changing the 'meaning' of ls might confuse more than it helps, so alias lsa='ls -a' might be preferable.\n\nA: To see the hidden files in the finder you can also use cmd + shift + .

This is strange and I’m not sure what is happening\n\nA: If the flash drive is using the Master Boot Record partition map, then an ExFAT formatted partition will be given the ID of 7. A NTFS formatted partition is also given an ID of 7. The TYPE column output from the diskutil list command uses character strings to identify IDs. The ID of 7 has been assigned the string Windows_NTFS. This does not mean the partition is necessarily formatted NTFS.

The pathway in code from where this input comes to an application is entirely different than the pathway that processes keyboard events.\nYes, you could invent or buy software to take that atomic paste and then pick apart keystrokes, decide on a time interval and any variation to simulate “typing”.

The Windows installer kicked in. Unfortunately we weren't prepared with a working \"Windows Key\" and had to abort.\nAfter a working key was found, we tried to run the installation again, but VirtualBox, Settings -> Storage was showing a VERR_ACCESS_DENIED error on the ISO file.\nWe tried deleting the new Windows VM and starting over by creating a new Windows 10 VM, but attempts to connect to the ISO file produced the same error.\nI'm wondering what could be the problem.\nIn researching, I've seen the following possible causes mentioned:\n\n*\n\n*ISO file corruption.

But as I did this I realized that certain text editors create autosave files.\nAre there any text editors, or other ways, to ensure I don't end up leaving traces of the text file, or its content outside of the encrypted volume?\n\nA: If you can, avoid using a graphical editor.\nmacOS is designed to help the user; graphical applications typically support auto-saving and snapshots by default – this functionality is provided by macOS for developers to use.\nInstead prefer a minimal command line editor such as nano or pico.\nAs an aside, have you turned off the access log for the encrypted volume? See How can I stop fseventsd for certain volumes?\nAdditionally, if the volume appears mounted via the Finder, be sure to disable Spotlight Indexing.\nTrust?\nGiven your desire for security, you should not trust the community and assume any suggested tools are trustworthy. Instead, examine and build from source yourself:\n\n*\n\n*pico's source is part of Alpine;\n\n*nano's source is part of GNU.\n\n\nA: Depending on the level of sensitivity an app that \"leaves no trace\" might not be enough. Perhaps you need to consider the use of a separate machine (physical or virtual) without internet access where you do the editing of sensitive text files. Then you wouldn't need to be concerned about any cache or autosave as it all would happen in the secure environment anyway.\nIf the contents are less sensitive you could consider an encrypting text editor, such as DeadboltEdit (not affiliated):\n\nSecure encrypting text editor for Mac OS X™, Windows™, and Linux™. DeadboltEdit is a basic text editor that uses strong encryption to store files.\n\nOn the topic of autosave they write:\n\n\n\n*Does the Mac OS X version of DeadboltEdit support Autosave?\nNo. There are no plans to implement Autosave.\n\n\n\nA: BBEdit seems to do what you want.\nIts a simple text editor with great features. It opens files, colors the syntax if it detects it (this doesn't change the file, it just makes the file more readable. Then, when you save the file, the text file is overwritten & the changes are saved. You can save as to save the file as a different name/directory. No autosave. No caching. The search functionality is amazing - super fast & very useful. And it is reputable, since its first release was in 1992 and its had strong reviews ever since. Just make sure to disable the default autosave setting.\nAnother option is to open the file via nano (super simple linux text editor) through the terminal. But this is more advanced, so I recommend BBEdit.\n", "Q: How to turn on and find connection logging for SMB Windows file sharing server log in macOS 12 (Monterey)+? Having some trouble finding out if a Windows client is actually hitting a macOS 12 file server. It seems like they are, but I can't seem to find any connection / access logs that indicate such things on macOS now. Where are these stored or does this function have to be turned on and, if so, then where would I find it?\n\nA: It appears macOS no longer has an actual log file for the SMB server. The smbd process logs can be found in Console.app by doing a search for \"PROCESS: smbd\" as follows in the top right side of Console.app:\n\nThis will allow you to see all connection attempts and other log-related items for the smbd SMB Windows sharing server on macOS.\n", "Q: Every time I open terminal I realize that zsh_history Symbolic Link has been deleted Hey Guys I using zsh and moved my .zshrc,.zsh_history and .oh-my-zsh to the dropbox folder to back up them and use them everywhere, and I created a Symbolic Link to them to use them\nbut every time I create a Symbolic Link for.zsh_history I see that has been created but every time that I open the terminal and check home directory I see that .zsh_history file has no Symbolic Link.\nand I use this command:\nmv .zsh_history ~/Dropbox/ZSH_Backup/ && rm -f .zsh_history && ln -s ~/Dropbox/ZSH_Backup/.zsh_history ~\n\nSo what is the problem?\n\nA: It appears to be a common issue with zsh.\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/a/111730/45383\n\nThe easiest way to do this would be to not use links at all. The location of the zsh history file is determined by the value of $HISTFILE. So, to have that backed up, change it from the default value to a file in the watched directory. Add this line to your .zshrc:\n\nHISTFILE=$HOME/Dropbox/ZSH_Backup/.zsh_history\n\n", "Q: How do I add music to an iPhone from a Mac laptop without replacing the library on either device? I am trying to add music from a laptop running MacOS 12.4 to an iPhone 7 running 15.5. When I try to do this no matter which options I select, I get a message saying that syncing the two devices will replace media on another library, I guess because I can only sync with one computer at a time? (I already synced another iPhone.) Is there a way around this?\n\nA: iTunes/Music will only sync tunes from the library it's connected to. Swap computers, swap libraries, it will not merge, it will overwrite. It may play havoc with other things you expect to sync too, photos etc.\nThe only way to achieve what you want is to get all the tunes onto the Mac it is normally synced to.\n", "Q: What exactly are the Serial Ports listed and why don't they have a \"normal\" numbering scheme?

It is however not referenced by a simple \"port number\" (as you would expect on for example earlier versions of Windows) - but rather they are referenced by a device type, major device number and minor device number - in the Unix tradition.\nIf you look at for example your Bluetooth device, you can find the numbers by running a command like this in the Terminal:\nstat  -f \"Name: %N%n%tType: %HT%n%tMajor: %Hr%n%tMinor: %Lr%n%n\" /dev/tty.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port\n\nThis will list the type of device (which is always \"character\" for serial ports) and the major and minor device numbers.\nYou can create a new \"name\" for your device by way of the mknod command. Choose a name and place in the file system, and make sure you choose the right device type and major and minor numbers, and you have a new way of accessing your device.\nSo that explains how the system gets from this seemingly \"random\" name to device numbers that are used internally. However knowing that there is an internal counter of \"USB serial port #1\" and \"USB serial port #2\" etc. doesn't really help you much in programmatically finding the right device when you have multiple connected.\nIf you're used to the Linux operating system, you might know that they use a program called udevd to (amongst other things) create a common way of mapping connected devices to device files. With it you might create rules for specifying your names for specific devices, so that no matter when or in which port it is connected, you can always refer to it by a specific name. However, macOS does not use such a udevd program.\nAs for the names of the devices themselves (the default names) - they are actually chosen by the driver for each type of device. That is - there's no common naming scheme that applies to all types of devices.\nIn particular for your USB serial device that had the weird \"14301\" numbers in the name - this is typically seen with USB-to-RS-232 chipset driver. The \"14301\" is actually the serial number of that chip. This can be a handy way to consistently identity a specific USB serial device - no matter the order, they are plugged in.\nIf you have a more involved setup, I would recommend a program named serial-monitor available here. It allows you to list all the available serial ports with lots of information, and allows you to filter that list by criterion such as serial number, manufacturer, product or even port number. You can then get from \"device made by company XYZ\" to \"/dev/cu.usbserial-9812938\". It is very handy when scripting.\n", "Q: Buy Apple giftcard from other countries online store Ok so I want to gift my friend who lives in other country an Apple giftcard. I know Apple giftcards are region locked, therefore, I am wondering if it is possible to buy Apple giftcards in the Apple online store appropriate for the region in which my friend lives.\nHow can I spend money in another country’s store?\n\nA: You will have the best luck online and can usually get pre-sales help if needed.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/\nThe store will detect your location, but in the far bottom right, choose the country in which you want to shop:\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/choose-country-region/\nNote, you will likely need to be able to speak the language or call to the support group in that country and comply with all banking, delivery, anti-fraud and money laundering controls for both countries (where your bank and money are as well as where the purchase will happen). Worst case, if you get totally stuck and can’t arrange physical delivery or payment, try calling Apple pre-sales support in your country to see if they can help get your cart set up.\nMoving money internationally can add unexpected costs and delays, as the system is designed that way.\n", "Q: Run Xcode Hello World from Command Line I have installed Xcode and created the Command Line Tool project for \"Hello, World!\".

I’m worried about trying to update because if there’s some part of the process where I have to click next and it doesn’t use Bluetooth at that point im going to be screwed.\n\nA: Yes, Bluetooth works when you are updating your Mac. The only times it doesn’t is when the normal keyboard doesn’t work as well.\nYou likely just have Bluetooth issues or interference in this case. Any USB keyboard or mouse can be connected when you have challenges with Bluetooth - better to line them up now (and make sure your backup is current) if you suspect your Mac is not stable.\n\nA: It should work.

I have a machine that reboots nightly, but when it does it ends up connecting to the wrong router somehow, and always gets the wrong IP.  I don't want it to use a static IP, I have my router issue it a reserved address.\nAnyway, it's easily fixed by renewing the DHCP lease (Ethernet, not wifi), but I want this to be automated after the reboot.  I can't get this to work from cron for some reason... I've tried both of these:\n* * * * * echo \"add State:/Network/Interface/en0/RefreshConfiguration temporary\" | sudo scutil\n* * * * * sudo ipconfig set en0 DHCP\n\nNeither does anything from Cron, but works fine from the CLI manually.\nHow can I get this to work via cron?\nEDIT: I have tried using the root user as suggested in the first answer, but this also does nothing.  No change, nothing output to a log, just nothing.\n\nA: Important first step\nMake sure cron is working. You need to grant /usr/sbin/cron full disk access. Here's a good guide. You should be able to have the current date and time appear in a file\n* * * * * /bin/date > /Users/yourusername/cronout.txt\n\nRoot crontab\nAdding sudo to a crontab entry won't work because sudo is requires you to enter your password when the the command runs and cron is not interactive so you cannot enter your password.\nThere are several ways to make this work. The easiest, and reasonable one for this use case, is to have this job run as root. Log in as root and create the crontab there.\n% sudo -i # Opens an interactive shell as root \nroot# EDITOR=nano crontab -e # EDITOR is probably not configured for root  \n\nThat'll open the nano editor. Feel free to use vi. In the editor add one of your commands, without the sudo\n* * * * * ipconfig set en0 DHCP\n\nSave. I like to test my cron entries with crontab -l. Once that's done, exit the shell logged in as root with exit or ^D.\nIf you need to troubleshoot this problem further, add some logging information to cron. Change the line to\n* * * * * ipconfig set en0 DHCP &>> /Users/JVC/cron.log\n\nThat will append the output of cron to a log file that you can read and discover why the command didn't work.\nAn alternate means to this end would be to modify your sudoers file via visudo to permit this command to run without requiring a password 1.\nThat leaves open the questions of why 1) you need to reboot every night and 2) why this machine connects to the wrong router, but this should solve you immediate problem.\n", "Q: Is it permissible to use the Xcode 3.0 DeRez and Rez command line tools for purposes other than localization? I have an Apple Mac that has Mac OS X 10.5.8. On this Mac, Xcode version 3.0 is installed. From what I can tell, there are also the DeRez and Rez command line tools. The Xcode software may have been installed from one or more DVDs that came with the Mac.\nIn the Xcode documentation (which can be viewed by launching the Xcode application and then choosing Documentation from the Help menu), there is a page, “Command-Line Tools,” which mentions the DeRez and Rez tools. The path to this page is ADC Home > Reference Library > Guides > Mac OS X > Mac OS X Technology Overview > Mac OS X Developer Tools >. It may be possible to find this page in the Xcode documentation by doing a full-text search over all documentation sets with the search term “DeRez” (without quotes) and the “Contains” option (as opposed to “Starts With” or “Exact”) chosen.\nIn the “Command-Line Tools” documentation page, there is a “Localization Tools” section. In this section, there is the statement “Table C-15 lists the applications and command-line tools for localizing your own applications.” Afterwards, there is a statement about the directory locations of the tools and then there is a table with information about the DeRez, genstrings, and Rez tools. The description for the DeRez tool includes the statement “You can use this utility to find strings for localization purposes, for example.” The description for the Rez tool includes the statement “You can use Rez to recompile the resource files you decompiled with DeRez after you have localized the strings.” Given these statements about localizing and this categorization of the DeRez and Rez tools, the following question comes up:\nIs it permissible under the licensing for the Xcode software and the DeRez and Rez command-line tools to use the DeRez and Rez tools for purposes other than localization (or, put another way, for purposes that do not involve localization)?\nI have a software project and there is a resource file (with the .rsrc extension) in the project. For the purposes of this posting, I am using the name MyGreatProject.rsrc to refer to the file. One way to edit resources in the file or to add new resources to the file would be to use DeRez to decompile the file into a Rez source file with a command along the lines of DeRez -useDF MyGreatProject.rsrc Carbon.r > MyGreatProject.r. (As a side note, when using the DeRez or Rez tools, it would hopefully be permissible to refer to an Apple-supplied Rez type declaration file such as Carbon.r in order to make the Rez source file contents easier to understand. The DeRez man page talks about the function of type declaration files. Also, I hope this command line example does not implicate any copyrights regarding the DeRez man page or the Rez man page.) After that step, it would be possible to add or edit or remove resources by editing the MyGreatProject.r Rez source file. After that, it would be possible to regenerate the MyGreatProject.rsrc file by using a command along the lines of Rez -useDF Carbon.r MyGreatProject.r -o MyGreatProject.rsrc. (Once again, I hope this command example does not pose any copyright issues regarding the DeRez man page or the Rez man page.)\n\nA: Yes, that is definitely permissible.\n", "Q: How to keep a history/records of past calculations in the calculator app in the paper tape?

The default Ken Burns settings also seems to play videos fleetingly. Classic theme plays complete videos. The audio in video clips can not be muted. Basically the slideshow functionality in Photos is quite basic. There are many dedicated slideshow apps on the Mac App Store, use one of those (I like Quik by Go Pro but there are plenty others.)\n\n", "Q: Accidentally moved my files with a sudo command to a non-existent directory. Now I can't find my files On my mac, I tried moving all my .pdf files from my /Downloads directory to my documents directory but I made a typo. I used the following command:\nsudo find Downloads -name \"*.pdf\" -exec mv {} /Users/Downloads \\;\n\nThe mistake I made was that /Users/Downloads isn't an existing directory and now I can't find my files. I was supposed to move the files to /Users/[System name]/Documents. I think that I made a mistake because the path that it should be moved to should be /Users/[name of the system/Downloads \\;\nI've tried searching for the lost files to no avail. Is there any way to recover my .pdfs? Any method for recovering the files would help me greatly.\n\nA: When you move a file to a folder that doesn't exist, the file is renamed to become the [intended] folder name. Check the file on your machine entitled /Users/Downloads, it may be -one- of the PDF files you moved. The rest may be gone, and might only be able to be restored if you have a backup.\n", "Q: How do I import a .pfx certificate into my iphone? I have iphone 13, but downloading the single .pfx certificate didn't show any option to install it, the guides on the internet suggest mailing it, so I've tried sending it to my gmail but that also doesn't show any option, how do I do it?\n\nA: You have to download and open it in Safari not Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Opera... then you are presented with the option to install it.\n", "Q: What is macOS Sonoma? Does it exist? While reading an article about System Preferences in macOS Ventura, I came across this image:\n\nAs you can see, it says \"macOS Sonoma\". Is this an existing macOS?

I don't have an existing device that I feel comfortable downloading the Beta on myself to check.\n\nA: From the article\n\nA new concept imagines how Apple could revamp the System Preferences app design, with a focus on striking a balance between maintaining familiarity with the classic System Preferences design while also bringing it more in line with Settings on iOS and iPadOS.\n\nThis, together with the fact that the article was posted months before the WWDC, shows that it doesn’t describe an actual idea but rather an idea somebody had about how a revamped System Preferences panel could look like.\n\n*\n\n*https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/settingsapp\nThey predicted a lot of things quite well but obviously their made-up name for the next macOS release missed the mark.\n", "Q: Can't `pip install p4python` on Apple Silicon I recently upgraded my system from an Intel Mac to an M1 Pro.

Whenever I resume the mac from sleep, the 2 monitors take a few seconds to boot up. In that time, macos determines that no displays are connected and moves all the windows to the laptop display, ruining my layout. Can this be avoided? I've tried apps like Rectangle Pro to save layouts, but since I have multiple instances of each app rectangle manages to mangle the layout even more, taking 2 different windows of the same app and stacking them.\n\nA: What could be happening is the Mac is trying to get EDID from the problem monitor and timing out.  If there was some way to make the Mac skip this check and just override it with some specific settings that might resolve the issue.   Another trick would be to use an EDID emulator that plugs in line between your monitor and mac and answers the DDC queries coming from the Mac so your monitor can take its sweet time waking up.\n", "Q: Macintosh IIsi Hard disk pinout A simple one if you know the answer: how many pins does the SCSI interface on the Mac IIsi have.\nI thought I could just pull drives from my SE/30 collection but it sounds like that's not the case. Please advise.\n\nA: The Mac SE/30 and IIsi use the same SCSI interfaces, and you should be able to swap drives freely between them (though a Mac OS system that'll boot one won't necessarily work with the other).  More specifically, both have:\n\n*\n\n*A 25-pin DB-25 external connector. This is nonstandard, but it's the same interface Apple used starting with the Mac Plus, and IIRC ending with the beige PowerMac G3s.\n\n*An internal 50-pin header connector (data) and 4-pin Molex power connector. This is standard; see the \"Internal Industry Standard 50-pin SCSI F/W\" connectors in this IBM doc. In fact, pretty much all 8-bit (\"narrow\") SCSI drives from that era use this same internal interface (though the standard external interface is a 50-pin Centronics connector, with the same pinout as the internal header version).\n\n\nA: The IIsi has a DB-25 SCSI port.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/sp199\nUnless you really want to reuse existing drives for reasons (and there are several I can imagine) an emulator is also a good option.\n\n*\n\n*https://tom.scsi.blue/product/bluescsi-db25/\n\n*https://github.com/erichelgeson/BlueSCSI/wiki/Supported-Systems\nNote the IIsi doesn’t provide termination power, so that might be why you are thinking the pin out is sus.\n\nThe IIsi does not provide TERM POWER. It must be powered via the Berg connector or USB on the BluePill.\nFrom the IIsi service manual:\n\n\"The 85C80 [SCSI controller] does not provide the internal SCSI disk drive with termination power; the drive provides the termination power.”\n\n\n", "Q: defaults delete domain is not working I'm trying to clear out the defaults for an app I'm working on.\ndefaults read com.mycompany.Foo\n\nThat prints a bunch of stuff.\ndefaults delete com.mycompany.Foo\n\nSilent.\ndefaults read com.mycompany.Foo\n\nIt's all still there.

I've opened it and found there was very little dust inside, but I cleaned out whatever little bit there was. Now my MBP seems to have two modes: (1) frying pan on my lap. (2) fans running full blast. I've installed a fan controller app to avoid over-heating but this just makes the fans run more than the default settings allow.\nMost advice I can find online says to clean out the dust or get a cooling pad. Is there really no fix for this hot slab of metal or my fans running full blast? I'm not afraid of opening it up and poking at stuff if I need to.\n\nA: Reset your PRAM and SMC. Those can sometimes make cooling a little wonky.\nPRAM:\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer and disconnect all USB devices (except wired keyboards).\n\n*Press the power button to turn on your Mac.\n\n*Immediately press and hold the Option, Command, P, and R keys on your keyboard. You need to press this key combination before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold down these keys for 20 seconds, during which time your Mac will appear to restart.\n\nOnce you hear the startup chime for the 2nd time, release the buttons. Your Mac will now restart and some basic settings like volume will be reset.\nIf that doesn't work, reset your SMC as well. Check this site for specifics, as your exact model will matter.\nAfter resetting both, your issue should be resolved as long as it isn't a hardware issue like a temperature sensor going stupid.\nAlso, I've used Macs Fan Control before and it works really well at letting you control your fans.\nI hope at least one of those helps!\n", "Q: Slack not recognising Screen Recording permissions I have two users who are reporting that the Slack app continues to send them to the System Preferences→Security & Privacy→Privacy->Screen Recording list when they try and screen share.\nThey have confirmed that it is checked.

I asked one to go in to the Slack Preferences→Audio & Video and run Run an audio, video and screen sharing test and usually it says Screen sharing is denied, occasionally it says it should work, but it doesn't when they try again.\nOf course I cannot replicate the problem at all.\n\nA: I removed the app store version of Slack and downloaded it from the official Slack website instead, then it's working fine.\n\nA: I've had issues with similar settings in Privacy before. I've found that selecting the app then using the minus (-) to remove the app, then the plus (+) to add the app back often fixes it and makes it recognize.\nAlso, make sure there aren't multiple instances of the app running in Activity Viewer.

Another one I have on a USB extender cable running to underneath my sofa, for the Mac I use to watch TV on. The third, an older type with its own little stand, was lifted up to sit under the monitor, again as close to the mouse as we could get. Different Logitech types, only one is an MX, but all similar in behaviour. All used to get the hiccups before we took this remedial action.\nI also very occasionally notice Options seems to forget it's running & consequently my programmed actions fail until I re-open the control app, but this doesn't seem related.\n\nA: I have the same issue on my MX Master 3S on both Linux Debian 11 and Windows 10. I called Logitech tech support and they decided to replace via warranty after I explained the issue regardless of even having options installed. The replacement device will be here later this week.\n\nA: Ok, so this doesn't seem to make much sense, but oddly enough, the only way to get the MX Master 3S to work smoothly on a new M2 MBP, was to also connect the USB cable, while using the mouse in Bluetooth mode through the dongle that came with it.\nFor some reason, macOS stubbornly refuses to accept the MX Master 3S if it's only connected by USB. Same is the case when trying to connect through Bluetooth directly - i.e. without Logitech's dongle. In both cases, the mouse isn't recognized.\nBeside that, neither disabling \"Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices\" in System Preferences->General, nor installing Logi Options+ had any (noticeable) effect.\nThe fact that the mouse is working flawlessly on both Ubuntu and Windows indicates that this is a macOS issue.\n", "Q: All of a sudden can't open .dmg files on Monterey My MacBook Pro 13\" M1 crashed last night, I think because I switched off my external USB-C monitor.

I have a PDF that is from a scanner that is only an image (no text).\nIs there any way to extract the image out of the PDF in Mac Preview?\nOr is that the same thing as converting the PDF to an image?\n\nA: Method 1\nThe Poppler PDF rendering library provides pdfimages (amongst other useful utilities) which will extract individual images from a PDF to an output specification e.g.:\n% pdfimages -png input.pdf output\nwill produce a set of numbered output images in PNG format. The default output formats are PBM or PPM for mono and colour images respectively. The -j flag will extract embedded JPGs as JPG but other files will usually be output as PPM if the default is not changed. See the manpage for more options.\nPoppler can be installed from Homebrew % brew install poppler\nMethod 2\nWhile not actually extracting embedded images in a PDF as usable files, convert from the ImageMagick suite will output each page as an image file, given a suitable incantation. Note the example from SU:\n% convert -density 600 foo.pdf foo-%02d.jpg\n(The %02d is to specify an incrementing number suffix in each output file.)\nThere are many other command line options to convert. With a suitable density you can crop the resulting images if required with little loss of resolution.\nThe ImageMagick download page has numerous install options for the package, including Homebrew and MacPorts.\nUsually with these sort of issues you will need to think outside the box of the common tools such as Preview, there's usually always something open-source that will do the job.\n\nA: I have always used File Juicer for extracting all the individual components of PDFs.  It works fine for a PDF with a single image inside.\nFile Extractor is cheaper (particularly from the App Store), but I have never used it.\nI expect there are other GUI apps, as well as command line utilities which will do the job for you.\n\nA: It is not possible to extract just the image from a PDF in Apple Preview.app. However, here are two alternative ways:\n1. Crop the PDF to the image.\nGo to the Menu Bar -> Tools and select Rectangular Selection. Then:\nDrag a box around the image in question and then press Command+K which will crop to the selected area. Then you can save.\n2. Screenshot the image.\nPress Command-Shift-4 and then drag a box to select the image - when you let go, it will automatically save to your screenshots location. (By default this is Desktop.)\nThese might not be the most effective ways for batch converting, but they will work.\n\nA: If it's a standard PDF file then you can save the image from the right-click option.\n", "Q: What are all the apple entries in my KeyChain?

I've been looking for a nice contact sheet facility.\nI learned that Preview has such a thing — \"Oh joy!\" I thought!\nBut Preview (Version 11, from Catalina) disproportionately scales height and width, yielding square images in the contact sheets!\nAAARRRGGGHHH!!! NOBODY wants that to happen to their images! Looking back on the historical meaning of \"contact sheet,\" how could they even THINK that would be acceptable?\nI've been poking around, trying to see if this could be changed somehow. Holding down any of the meta keys while selecting \"Contact Sheet\" does nothing useful. I've glanced through Preview's .plist file in ~/Library/Preferences.\nI don't know enough about defaults(1) to know if there's anything in there that could be hacked.\nI posted this on Apple's community site, and apparently this is fixed in newer MacOS releases, but there are no plans to fix this for Catalina, and my hardware won't run anything newer. Alternatively, anyone know if a newer version of Preview (with aspect-preserving contact sheets) works in Catalina?\nThanks in advance for any information offered! I'm a retired developer, and am willing to poke around if given a decent likelihood of finding something.\n\nA: I've asked experts at Apple and in several developer groups — no good answer for Preview on Catalina.\nI've also browsed the App Store and numerous download sites for such a thing. The ones I found all had some fatal flaw — and many of them offered you a \"pro\" version that got rid of that fatal flaw! No thanks; I want to see what I'm paying for.\nThen in one venue, I got a recommendation for XnView MP. It is free — and unencumbered with nagware or missing features — to individuals and non-profit organizations, but they request a payment for business use. They do welcome donations, but don't insist on it. I've voluntarily contributed!\nIt's a little bit quirky and very much a cross-platform application; the \"MP\" stands for \"Multi Platform,\" and there is a \"Classic\" version that is Windows-only. The MP version carries a lot of Windows heritage, such as \"Explorer\" instead of \"View in Finder\", and Windows-style text editing, for example.\nBut these are minor annoyances, and it does a lovely job of making highly configurable contact sheets, with or without a wide variety of supplemental information.\nI did find one bug, which was quickly acknowledged on the XnView forum: pre-configured output dimensions in inches are not \"sticky\" in the contact sheet settings. With developer guidance, I simply chose \"pixels\" (instead of \"inches\") with the proper number for 8.5\"x11\" paper, and it remembered my setting.\nI'm still annoyed that Apple made such a blunder in Preview, but I'm very happy with my new contact sheets from XnView MP.\n(I have no relationship to the makers of XnView MP, except as a satisfied user.)\n\n", "Q: Security Preferences: Open Anyway button gone I'm developing a desktop app, so it's unsigned. When launched first time, it fails with access denied. I used to be able to click Open Anyway in the Security Preferences, but now that button is gone.

Since updating to Mac OS 12.4 (from 10.14.6), I notice that the little grey arrow next to email threads in the Mail app now appears next to any thread on which I've written a reply, even if the latest message in the thread is incoming from someone else and I haven't replied since it came in.\nOf course I consider this is a regression in user experience; I like to know whether I've answered the thread since the last email came in, which is what the little grey arrow used to indicate.\nIs there any hidden setting or option somewhere that controls this feature?  Does anyone know of a workaround to restore the previous behavior, or any approximation thereof?  (Any way to see at a glance which threads I've answered and which I haven't.)\n(If you're pretty sure there isn't a way I'd welcome your comment even if you're not sure enough to write it as an answer.)\n\nA: There is no \"hidden setting\" for this, and that is default behavior in Monterey. However, you can set up a Rule to make them appear differently. Rules can be found under Mail -> Preferences (Command-comma) -> Rules. Then add Rules based on if you are the sender of a message and make it a different color if it is. This will make it a whole lot easier to differentiate.\n", "Q: Iphone keeps reconnecting and disconnecting via USB Occasionally, when I connect my iPhone XR to Mac Book Pro (Mid-2015) model, the iPhone starts disconnecting and reconnecting.\nIt doesn't happen all the time, but it does usually happen once a day. Is there anyway to fix it?\nSometimes the iPhone won't be detected by the Mac at all, but this is much rarer.\nI recently did a clean reinstall of MacOS Monterey, so that should probably rule out a lot of issues.\nI only use the official lightning cable that comes with the iPhone. I have also checked the iPhone port has no dirt in it.\nThanks!\n\nA: Your phone is not staying connected so that means something in the chain isn't functioning. Whether that's the MacBook's USB port, the cord, or your XR's dock, you would need to replace the faulty component.\nI would make sure all the ports & connectors are clean. I would try a new cord (a few to be safe) using different ports on your MacBook. If that doesn't work then most likely you need to replace your phone's dock (part with the charging port).\nIf you have a good eye & a flashlight, you can look inside the ports to see if any of the metal pins are bent/missing, or corrosion (dusty green stuff). It's always a best bet to take them to to a repair shop to have them test the components using tools you might not have access to.\n", "Q: Using Time Machine for Backup on Old OS Version Tomorrow, I am getting the battery replaced on my early 2015 macbook air. As there is a chance of data loss, I plan on using \"time machine\" to make a back up on an external drive beforehand. I am currently using macOS Catalina. If my disk gets completely erased and I have to re-install macOS, potentially a newer version, will I still be able to restore my data from the backup made in Catalina, or should I update my computer beforehand? If I update, I will have Monterey, (edit: it turns out that Ventura is not yet the current version, so no cause for concern there). I would rather not update if not necessary out of concern that the newer versions may not run as smoothly on my old hardware, and if \"time machine\" would not work either way then I am seeking an alternative that would work in the event of total data loss on this computer.\n\nA: This general advice:\nYou should be able to restore from a Catalina backup with Catalina or any more recent version of macOS (e.g. Monterey). But, it is always most trouble free to restore with same version as that of the Time Machine backup. So I recommend to either:\n\n*\n\n*Restore with Catalina and use your current backup. You may need to use a bootable USB flash drive to install Catalina.\n\n*Update to Monterey first and make a Time Machine backup. Restore by installing Monterey and recovering from the most recent Monterey backup.\n\nBefore any upgrade, make sure that your applications will run with the newer macOS - or have replacements.\nWhen you do upgrade to Monterey, consider starting Time Machine on a new backup disk. I say this because Time Machine now uses APFS disk format which is much more robust for backup.\nIn any event, keep your old Time Machine backups until you are sure you don't need them.\n", "Q: What is the user 'mobile' for on iPad? I just sshed to a jailbroken iPad(Pro 3, iOS 14.2), and found other than root and daemon, there's an existing user mobile, which seems to come with the system. I was wondering\n\n*\n\n*what the user is for?\n\n*if I do not change the password, can others ssh to my device with this account?\n\n*if I do change the password, can it mess with the normal system operation?\n\n\nA: mobile is the default Non-Privileged user for the device. This user is for using the terminal when you do not need escalated privileges for everything (i.e. root). Since it is an existing user, I would recommend changing it and all other default passwords you haven't changed yet as that is a security risk. Your system will function all the same, just make sure you remember the password if you ever need to get back in!\nI would also like to note that is it better practice to login to the non-privileged user account and escalate to root as needed.\n", "Q: Saved iMessage Audio clips - Where are they stored? A very precious audio message came my way via Messenger this evening, and the app offered for me to save it once I finished listening to it, so of course I saved it. Now I am wondering where these recordings are stored to on my device, and how I can access them in the future.\nI'd like to know several things:\n\n*\n\n*how do I access these saved recordings?\n\n*is it possible to export them via email, messenger, or other applications so that I may save them to external storage?\n\nRunning ios 15.5 on Apple Iphone 7\nThanks!\n\nA: By default, iMessage audios expire and are automatically deleted 2 minutes after listening to them.\nSo when you were prompted to save it, it wasn't actually being stored but rather just not being expired and deleted. If you scroll back on the iMessage conversation you should be able to still see it and reproduce it.\nNow the weird bit.\nIf you now long press on the audio, you'll be prompted to save it. This  should theoretically send it to the Voice Memos App, but this doesn't seem to be happening.\nAt this point, the simplest way of storing these audios would be through a Mac – one on which you are logged in with the same Apple ID.\nIf you open the appropriate conversation in the Messages application, scroll to the audio, you should then be able to just drag and drop the audio into any folder you want.\n\nBy the way, iMessage's default action for audios can be changed under Settings > Messages, and the Audio Messages section.\n\n", "Q: macOS keeps trying to open .yml files with Xcode after being told to use Atom I use the Atom text editor, and I want to use that to open .yml files.

A few weeks ago it stopped backing up and when i try and manually start a backup this occurs.\n\nHow do i prevent this happening so i  ay continue to backup my computer?\nCheers.\n\nA: I don’t back up to nas so I can’t fix that specific error, but one excellent troubleshooting step you can do is attempt a restore from that volume.\nThe requirements to restore are fewer than a complete backup.\nNext step is to add an external drive and add it as a second destination. See if Time Machine can do a backup to a different clean disk. It will still continue to try to back up to the nas every other interval, but at least you will know the system itself is good and keep backups current while you suss out the cryptic error code.\nLastly, even if you can’t restore from the sparse bundle, can you select it in finder and get it to mount? That will let you know if it needs repair in Disk Utility.\n\nA: I happened to have the same problem and found a lot of useless hints to solve the issue.\nI can assure you 100% it has nothing to do with file permissions, NAS version, NAS filesystem, ... it is 100% an incompatibility a Monterey patch introduced depending on when the disc was initially created.\nI'm using Synology DS918+ DSM 7.1-42661 Update 4 - which has served as a time machine capsule for years without problems.\nNow I'm getting error 19 while still being able to access the files and folders on the NAS without problems via SMB, AFP, SSH,...\nDepending on when you initially created your backup disc, it is not compatible anymore with Monterey.\n\nIf you upgraded to macOS Monterey, your existing backups are not\nupgraded.

Why does it produce different output?\n\nA: Various versions of strings have existed. Most of them simply look for a certain number (four or more) of printable ASCII characters, and decide, without context, that it's found a human-readable \"string.\" This appears to be the case with the supplied strings command.\nGNU gstrings appears to be much smarter. I don't have gstrings installed, but it seems to be using a heuristic that is a bit smarter than merely looking for printable ASCII characters. (Some 40 years ago, in a C programming class I took, one of our assignments was to write a better version of strings. It wasn't very difficult!)\nTo better understand the discrepancy, I suggest you use a different utility, hexdump.\nhexdump -C /bin/ls will show you the hexadecimal codes in a table for every byte in the file, with ASCII interpretations of them an the end of each row:\n00000000  cf fa ed fe 07 00 00 01  03 00 00 00 02 00 00 00  |................|\n00000010  13 00 00 00 10 07 00 00  85 00 20 00 00 00 00 00  |.......... .....|\n00000020  19 00 00 00 48 00 00 00  5f 5f 50 41 47 45 5a 45  |....H...__PAGEZE|\n00000030  52 4f 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |RO..............|\n00000040  00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000050  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000060  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  19 00 00 00 28 02 00 00  |............(...|\n00000070  5f 5f 54 45 58 54 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |__TEXT..........|\n00000080  00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00  00 50 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.........P......|\n00000090  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 50 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.........P......|\n\nAs you can see, the same \"real\" human-readable strings shown on the right are also in the gstrings output.\nSo, the simple answer is, GNU strings does a better job than the default BSD strings.\n", "Q: Syncing iCloud Drive to my Mac immediately creates 100 GB of system storage - OS Monterey I love iCloud and have been using it since forever. I understand that iCloud Drive is not a perfect cloud feature and is mostly about syncing files across devices. As an owner of an iPad, 2 Macbooks, and 2 iPhones, I really love iCloud.\nThe problem started when my Macbook Air for work became glitchy as I was lacking enough free space. I did a factory reboot and downloaded the new OS Monterey (yay!). Just in case, I didn't reboot through Time Machine back up. I wanted the Macbook as clean as possible. As soon as I synced my iCloud Drive, i gained 97 GB of system storage and I was again out of storage (121 GB Macbook Air)\nI got angry and unsynced my iCloud Drive.\nDouble checked that Time Machine was never on after the reboot.\nAnd then I deleted my cached files through Finder > option Go > Library > Caches.\n= 12.4 GB of system storage\nI became happier and decided to sync iCloud Drive again (because I need the easy navigation for work), but then system data started increasing and became 97 GB again.\nI assume that a stuck \"Waiting to Download\" (not upload) iCloud action is the culprit of this mess. But I have no method of tracking this action and deleting it. And now, I can't sync iCloud Drive to my Mac.

System Data is, really, \"everything else\". (Mine is currently 60Gb.)\nIf you're running out of space, check out how much space your entire User account takes up. Also, how many applications have you added, and how much space do they take? These are going to be the largest quantities.\nSecondly, deleting caches achieves nothing, as they will be recreated by the OS.\nIt's possible that iCloud has got itself into some sort of mess, but I would try to leave it and let it complete.\nOnce that's done, use an app like OmniDiskSweeper (free) to browse through your disk, sorted by file size. This will show you what and where the biggest files are, and let you delete them, if necessary.\n", "Q: Why is there a disk space discrepancy between System Report and Finder on MacOS Monterey? I'm using MacOS Monterey on a 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro.

The tools are doing what they’re designed to measure.\n\nFinder filters what you see based on permissions and assuming copies of files take all the space possible before optimizations.\nDisk utility is reporting block\nstorage which also contains snapshots, files you don’t have\npermission to measure and deducts space for duplicate files (copy on\nwrite changes, revisions of files, hard links, compressed files, etc…). If you use cloud\nfiles, finder and tools can be off even more due to “dehydrated”\nfiles that free up space on the device and are cloud backed so that\nthey download on demand.\n\nWhen you have 350 GB full, these effects will be far easier to measure - having 50 GB free should make it irrelevant how any of these “edge cases” affect the storage. You might be able to run even closer to less storage free and be totally happy and not run into issues, but that’s a long way off as you have barely begin to accumulate storage on that system.\n", "Q: 1991 timestamp in safari history I just opened my Safari History.db and realised that there are timestamps like\n671015068.337777\nwhich don't make sense, as I started to use my laptop this year...\nany idea ?\nthanks\n\nA: ok,\nthere is apparently 978307200 missing\ngot it from\nSee website visit time in Safari history\n(although, don't know why)\n", "Q: How to prevent MacBook Pro notch from hiding menu bar icons (from the right) In macOS Monterey it seems that menu bar entries can only occupy the space from the right corner to the notch in the middle. If you add more menu bar entries they just get hidden and you don't have any chance to see/interact with them.\nConsidering that the spacing has been increased (Can the spacing of menu bar apps be modified in Big Sur?) this is really a big problem. Menubar-living tools like iStatMenu are hardly usable.\nSo my question boils down to: How to force macOS to really show all menu bar icons? (be it by overflowing to the left side of the notch, decreasing spacing between the icons, 2-line menu bar, whatever)\n\nA: Dealing with the same issue on my MacBook. The only solution I know of is using Bartender to manage the items. It has a feature called Bartender Bar that allows the icons to move to a separate space below the menu bar where they won't be cut off by the notch. It also allows you to decrease the spacing between icons allowing for more icons onscreen before they hit the notch. Unfortunately, it's a paid software with a one-time $16 fee (though it does offer a free 4-week trial). Free alternatives to hide menu bar icons (like Dozer and HiddenBar) can't prevent icons from hiding behind the notch when expanded, or change the icon spacing.\n\nA: Apple lets you scale the menu bar for this use case.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212842\nThis is a per-app preference, so you need to quit the app and then get information on each app in Finder.

You would also need to isolate the virtual machine from the network to stop macOS fetching the time remotely.\n\nA: I created a script to solve this specific problem and then converted it into a shortcut to automate the process.

I noticed that starting Siri pauses the fans, probably combined with throttling the CPU.\nDoes anybody know a good way to approach this?\n\nA: Apart from fiddling with tools that can change the fan speed (which can potentially be risky), you can also put to sleep some (but not all!  ) of the CPU cores.\nFirst, find out how many CPU cores you have:\nsysctl -n hw.ncpu\n\nFor example, if the command above shows you have 16 CPU cores you can put half of them to sleep by running the following from the terminal:\nsudo cpuctl offline 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nPut the cores back online:\nsudo cpuctl online 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nView the online/offline state of the CPU cores:\nsudo cpuctl list\n\n\n❗️❗️ Do NOT pull all the cores offline, or otherwise your mac will crash! \n\nIf you feel nostalgic and want to re-experience the performance of pre-mswindows intel 386 computers then leave a single core online. Having only one core active will reduce both the fan noise and performance. :D\nFor details also see in terminal the manpages for:\nman sysctl\n\nman cpuctl\n\n\n NOTE: This only works on Intel macs, but does not (yet?) work on Apple Silicon M1/M2 chips.\n\n\n\n To visualize real-time CPU cores usage double-click the CPU LOAD graph in the Activity Monitor.app.\n\nThis is what you might see with only a single core online:\n\n", "Q: Apple Studio Display with Lenovo P1 running Windows 10 I have a Lenovo P1 (Gen 2) running Windows 10, and I am trying to get it to work with my new Apple Studio Display. The laptop has 2 x Thunderbolt 3 ports, and I have tried plugging in the display (using the cable that came with the display) into both of these ports. When I do this, the laptop seems to recognise the display, i.e., it shows up in my displays (see pic), and the speakers and microphone connect. Sound comes out of the speakers, and I think the microphone works, however, there is no picture.\nAny thoughts on how I can get the display to work as expected?\n\n\nA: The cable Apple provides does not work with the Lenovos over thunderbolt 3. Get another cable that supports power delivery.\n", "Q: When i press \"CTRL + C\" at \"caffeinate -i\" I get a non 0 exit status. Why? If I press CTRL + C at caffeinate -i I have a non 0 exit status.\n\nMy terminal prompt shows me with red x that the previous command had a not 0 exist status. Why is that?\n\nA: The source is at opensource.apple.com. Basically caffeinate -i ends up in a call to dispatch_main() which never returns (so it only can be interrupted).\n\nA: Because 0 indicates normal exit with a success status. Any other way to exit (with an error report, or an abnormal exit) causes a nonzero status.\nThere are two ways a program can end: either because it explicitly asked to exit (with the exit system call or equivalent), or because it was killed by a signal. If the program exits, it indicates its exit status as an argument to the exit system call, which is conventionally 0 for success and a number between 1 and 255 for errors. (What happens with higher values, or whether even higher values are possible, depends on the operating system, so very few programs even try.) If the program is killed by a signal, there is no exit status from the program (it didn't get a chance to set one), but instead the exit status indicates which signal killed the program.\nThe program's exit status is conveyed to the program's parent process via the wait system call (or equivalent). It encodes both the explicit exit status for normal termination (if the program called exit), and the signal number for abnormal termination (if the program was killed by a signal). In the shell, the status information, available in the special variable $?, is blended somewhat: it's the program's exit status for a normal termination, and the signal number plus 128 for abnormal termination. All signal numbers are in the range [1, 127], so $? is 0 for success, (normally) 1 to 127 for a normal exit indicating failure, and 129 to 255 for a signal.\nPressing Ctrl+C sends the signal SIGINT. If the program dies from it, its shell exit status is 130 (128 + SIGINT, and SIGINT = 2 on macOS).\nSome programs catch signals and run some cleanup code so that events like Ctrl+C cause a clean shutdown. Normally, once they've finished cleaning up, they disable the signal handler and re-raise the signal (rather than calling exit), so that the reason for termination is reflected in their exit status.\n", "Q: `open` is not functioning for ~/Documents/* On my main account on my main Mac, the open command is not functioning only for the sub directories under ~/Documents/.

The ls -la is intended to confirm that you are in the right place. The i in the rm is optional and will ask you to confirm each file - leave it out once you gain confidence! You would be safer to use rm -Ri Xamarin, etc. doing each folder individually.\nRead man rm if you are not familiar with the rm command.\nOf course, deleting anything as the root user can be risky (your risk).

I connect either laptop to the monitor through an Anker A8383 hub.\nI have noticed the following problem when switching between operating systems.

Rebooting the other MBP and then plugging in the BenQ monitor also allows the monitor to work.  I'd guess this is an interaction with macOS and the BenQ because Windows always works with the BenQ (at least, I haven't been able to get a black screen) but macOS appears more fussy.  Maybe it needs to talk to the BenQ and reconfigure it for macOS, and it only does that once on boot, I'm not sure.\n", "Q: How can I change the amount of iCloud storage for one family member? I've two kids under 13 set up in my Family Sharing with access to my 2TB iCloud storage.\nFor some reason, my son has an amount set of 5GB, which is way too low for what he needs on his iPad.

I've been looking on forums to see if and how I can change this 5GB limit (as I've plenty of memory available), but I haven't found anything yet.\nCan anyone advise me on how I can sort this out?\n\nA: I know of no way to configure iCloud storage per user in a Family. Most likely your son is limited to 5GB because he is using the 'free' iCloud storage of 5GB. He is either not signed into iCloud or he is signed in under a different account than you have for him in your Family Share. Since your daughter has more than 200GB, she is using the Family Share storage.\nEach iCloud account must be added to the Family Share, and each device must be logged into an iCloud account that is in the Family Share.\n\nA: I would chat with Apple support online before doing anything as drastic as kicking them from the family.

You can use two different terminal windows for this at the beginning. If everything goes as planned the shairport-sync will connect to pulseaudio and pulseaudio will in turn play the streamed data that receives from it. You can tweak settings in /usr/local/etc/shairport-sync/ and /usr/local/etc/pulse/\npulseaudio --exit-idle-time=-1\nshairport-sync\n\nGo to another device and select your Mac as the airplay destination. And walla, your Mac is the airplay receiver. It works for audio only. You can then dedicate your time to make pulseaudio and shairport-sync start automatically at login as daemons and with no terminal required.\n", "Q: How to remove Safari.app's \"Favorites\" Bookmark folder This is Safari version 15.6 (17613.3.9.1.5) running under macOS 12.5 (Monterey).\nI'd like to remove the Safari Bookmarks folder. It's easily emptied, but I've found no way to move it (putting it at the end of the Bookmark list would be an improvement) or delete it. Neither Google, nor the Apple user communities, nor this Stack return any useful advice on this issue. Apple certainly doesn't want the user to do this.\nIs it possible to delete this Bookmark folder? If so, how?\n\nA: You cannot remove this folder since it represents the bookmarks bar shown when the Bookmarks menu is accessed (as has been pointed out in the comments).\nIt's not just a pre-created folder; it's a built-in folder that cannot be modified.\n\nA: Rename the actual folder (wherever that resides???) putting a 'full stop' at the start of the word Bookmark so you'll have .Bookmarks or .Favourites. This may work but you've probably tried this already.\nAnother option is to look into the defaults command in the Terminal.app with caution obviously. I would > the output from the Terminal to a text file for the Safari defaults and the NSGlobal domain.\nI'm no expert but that is where I'd start.\n", "Q: Is it ok to use different size tips in each ear on my AirPods Pro? I tried using medium sized tips for both my ears but the left AirPod wasn't stable and kept coming out. So, I tried a small sized tip for my left ear and medium sized tip for my right ear. Now, they are stable in both ears. The ear tip fit test shows a good seal for both ears in this configuration. However, I'm concerned whether the difference in sizes can affect my ears because I listen to them for long periods daily and will probably do so for a few years at least.\n\nA: Symmetrically sized and placed appendages, organs, etc, of the human body does have measurable differences in: the comparative size of nostril openings; breast size and positioning (without surgical intervention, one breast is usually a bit lower down on the body;) leg and arm length; and ... ear canal diameters. You have proved this empirically! Congratulations!\nI do caution you, though, not to rely on earbuds solely for listening, especially for long, continuous periods of time, as you have indicated. They can push ear wax back into the ear canal when used too often (it happened to me.) Incidental high-volume audio glitches can also cause damage to your hearing.\nI prefer small Bluetooth/wired ear-cup headphones to ear-buds now. I only use my Bose Noise Cancelling buds when flying.\n", "Q: Cmd + shift + V not working in safari Shortcuts such as Cmd + Shift + V (paste plain text) or Cmd + Shift + 7 (comment out many lines in Overleaf) do not work in Safari, but do in Chrome.

The question is in the topic; the case is the following. I have several MacBooks and no iPhones at all - I just don't like them. I have a cat and I ordered an Airtag to follow him if he passes outside.\nMacBook Pro M1s seem to run very similar hardware as iPhones; even native support for running applications is there. I wonder why I just couldn't set up the Airtag on a MacBook since exactly that device all the time reaches the Airtag. It seems to me like a ridiculous attempt from Apple to lock Airtag not even to \"Apple trademark\" but to make every Apple user to buy an iPhone and it's quite disappointing.\nI would like to have any option to track my cat via MacBook M1, Mini M1, or Mac Studio. Does anyone know any way to do it? (as it seems, Xcode emulation for iPhones is quite limited and the application \"Find My\" for the iPhone version is hidden for macOS users). Maybe there is a hack that would allow installing the \"Find My\" application with the version from iPhone, not macOS?\nI hope someone could manage to solve this puzzle since Apple blocked this post on their own discussion pages.\n\nA: Apple only permits Airtags to be setup using an iPhone, iPad, or ipod.\nYou can't use any Mac to setup an Airtag at this time. In addition, because of how Airtags work, Apple also doesn't recommend using them to track pets.\n", "Q: Maps not rendering in Firefox and Safari on MacBook Pro 15\" early 2011 I have a MacBook Pro 15\" early 2011 running macOS Catalina with dosdude1's Catalina patcher. The dedicated GPU is inactivated with the non-permanent solution circulating elsewhere.\nEver since I upgraded (perhaps already in Mojave, but not sure about that) I'm unable to use Google Maps and most other map services in Firefox and Safari. In Google Maps, the map view renders correctly, but I'm unable to click any points of interest, and if I move around the map it lags heavily and soon turns black; basically unusable.\nHowever, in Opera Google Maps works perfectly fine! The computer does heat up and the fans start spinning, but at least Google Maps is fully functional and runs smoothly. Apple's own Maps app also runs without any trouble at all.\nI also have two MacBook Pro 13\" mid-2012 also running Catalina (officially supported), where Google Maps works perfectly fine on both Firefox and Safari, so it doesn't seem to be due to lacking browser support.\nAny idea what could be causing this? I assume the inactivated GPU may have something to do with it, but why does it work fine in Opera?\n\nA: I can only guess it's trying to render using hardware acceleration. As you don't have a Metal2 graphics chip, I doubt you'll get it to work unless you can disable that.\nAs of Catalina this is no longer possible in Safari [as all supported hardware is capable.]\nOn Chrome it's in Settings > Advanced > System\n", "Q: MacBook Air stuck on windows I was attempting to download Windows on my MacBook and it was successful so far.

I just suddenly noticed my iPhone 7 plus stopped giving me notification beeps despite all notification settings properly configured.\nI’ve read through solutions found online and after trying all steps, it’s still the same. The better solution I have experienced so far is that it’ll give me notification beeps for few minutes (max 1hr) and then it stops giving notification beeps again. Please let me know if anyone is experiencing this or has experienced it and what solution did the person arrive at?\nRight now my last hope is to restore factory settings but I’m still scared of losing apps and their data and at the end of the day, the issue won’t be resolved. I’ll be so glad if someone experienced can engage in this post.\n\nA: Try the following general tips if you have not already:\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut the phone down (long press the side button and swipe to shut down) and open it back up.\n\n*Make sure Do Not Disturb is off.\n\n*Check the ringer on the side and turn it off/on, sometimes there are unusual glitches that cause them to silence notifications.\n\nWhen you refer to beeps, are you talking about the audible \"ding\" noise that you hear out loud, or are you referring to the phone vibration? The audible \"ding\" may have to do with your volume settings or potentially could be a result of your environment, such as:\n\n*\n\n*The WiFi disconnects frequently or you don't have a solid internet connection for various periods of time at your home/wherever you use your phone (this can cause notifications to not load and you won't receive a notification)\n\n*Driving (there is a setting which mutes/blocks notifications while driving, some people are unaware this exists).\n\nIf you have a problem with vibration,  go to Accessibility > Touch > Scroll down to Vibration and click this setting on/off/on to make sure it is working properly.\nIt is important to note that some newer iPhones give a quieter notification sound when it detects that the user is looking at the phone/currently using the phone (Settings > Accessibility > FaceID & Attention >  Attention Aware Features). This feature is not on iPhone 7 as far as I know, but it is important to know for users who have the FaceID feature on their iPhone and are experiencing a similar issue.\n", "Q: Universal Control Stops Working after putting iPad to sleep (12.5) Universal Control has always been extremely glitchy for me, sometimes it works great a week, other times it flat out refuses to show up at all.\nI recently managed to get it working by factory resetting the MacBook and re-installing 12.4 but it broke again when updating to 12.5. I tried to factory reset the MacBook and iPad (again), this worked temporarily for a few hours and stopped working again.\nI have spent about 15 hours on the phone with Apple on 10+ calls and finally they agreed for a single person to take ownership of the case, but they will not pass it to engineers yet (argh!). Their suggestion has always been to re-install the OS so far (which I have done twice this week!) after the same common troubleshooting steps:\n\n*\n\n*Turn it off and back on, create a new user, safe mode, disable screen time.\n\n*Signing out/back in of Apple ID on all devices, ensure no VPNs, security software, etc, etc, etc - all of which I followed countless times at this point\n\nMy setup is:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro 13\" M1 2020 - v12.5\n\n*iPad Air 4 - v15.6\n\n*I also have an iPad Mini 6 (v15.6) but I am keeping it switched off to isolate the issue.\n\n*Tried on multiple wifi networks, as well as a Virgin Media Hub (latest with wifi6) isolated to just my MacBook and iPad (I'm usually using a Ubiquiti Wifi6 LR AP, testing 1m away from the dish).\n\nAfter many many hours of experimenting, I found a consistent reproducible case and captured some logs. These are the steps to reproduce:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off \"Cursor and Keyboard\" on iPad\n\n\n*Kill UniversalControl process on the Mac and delete the settings by running:\ncd ~/Library; killall -9 UniversalControl; rm ./Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.universalcontrol* ./SyncedPreferences/com.apple.kvs/ChangeTokens/EndToEndEncryption/UniversalControl/com.apple.universalcontrol; killall -9 UniversalControl\n\n\n*Toggle universal control off and back on on Mac\n\n\n*Turn on \"Cursor and Keyboard\" on iPad and reboot the iPad\nThis will make Universal Control work.

With the transition to Big Sur, the standard icon style for applications has changed to the rounded-square motif. Not a fan, I like to replace a few applications' icons with their older variants. I've typically done this with the \"Get Info / Drag Icon\" method (call it GIDI) similar to what is described in this question and answer. However, I'd like to automate the process instead of the manual one.\nI've noticed that after the GIDI method, there is a file Icon^M in the application's root folder. I can't determine what kind of file it is since file doesn't recognize it and it has zero size; otherwise, I'd presume it to be a copy of the .icns file. Looking in the Application's Resources folder, I see that the GIDI method doesn't replace the application's standard icon, so something else is happening.\nSo that being said, what is the Icon^M file and is there a way I can do this replacement programmatically?\nNote: I know that Apple's own applications that come with the macOS are protected under SIP and thus I would have to disable that for those icons. Those are out of scope for this; I'm only interested in 3rd party applications which do not require SIP to be disabled.\n\nA: I found a tool that makes this scriptable: fileicon.\nIn short, if you have a .icns file you can do something like:\nbash$ fileicon set /Applications/Microsoft\\ Word.app icon_i_prefer.icns\n...and it will do the resource fixing similar to what the 'Get Info / Drag Icon' routine I describe in the question does.\nProblem solved!\n", "Q: Microsoft Word Inter font only showing regular and bold I'm trying to use the Inter font in Microsoft Word but all of the different weights just show up and display as 'Regular'. I use this same font elsewhere and it works on my system, it's just an issue with MS Word, Excel, etc.\n\n\n\nA: Clear the font caches:\nquit all Microsoft Office applications; open Apple's Font Book. The procedure varies slightly depending on the MacOS respectively Fontbook version you are using - you basically have to check for duplicates and remove them.\nRestart the computer. MacOS will rebuild its font cache, and Word will rebuild its font cache from that.\nIf you only disable fonts you must do this every time you install an MS Office update, because the Microsoft installer tries to restore the disabled fonts each time - therefore deleting duplicates is the better option.\nIf the problem persist remove the installed Opensource Inter font family, download it and install it again via Fontbook.\n\nA: If Inter is not working in Word, make sure to use this download link (tip by slartibartfast) and install the individual OTF files, not Inter-V.ttf. After that, restart Word.\n", "Q: LaunchDaemon to run when a USB Hub is attached I'm trying to create a LaunchDaemon that runs a script when a USB-C or Thunderbolt dock is connected. I've found several solutions to run a script when a specific device is connected. But I need a solution that runs a script when any dock is connected.\nAs virtually all docks include a USB Hub, I tried to identify those and include them in a LauchDeamon: No luck. Then I looked into just triggering a script on any USB device like this:\n<key>LaunchEvents</key>\n<dict>\n        <key>com.apple.iokit.matching</key>\n        <dict>\n                <key>com.apple.device-attach</key>\n                <dict>\n                    <key>IOProviderClass</key>\n                        <string>IOUSBHostDevice</string>\n                        <key>IOMatchLaunchStream</key>\n                        <true/>\n                        <key>IOMatchStream</key>\n                        <true/>\n                </dict>\n        </dict>\n</dict>\n\n(Not the complete files)\nBasically the same approach I've found for specific devices, but removing the device identifiers. Also no luck.\nI've found EventScript. This application can run a script when a USB device is attached. But I prefer a solution that leverages macOS built-in tools/capabilities.\n\nA: I've been able to create a launch daemon that in my limited tests runs whenever any drive is mounted. However, this daemon runs in more cases than it should, as I'll explain later.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\nhttp://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd>\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.example.mountdrive</string>\n\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>say</string>\n        <string>Drive mounted.</string>\n    </array>\n\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Volumes/</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nSave this code in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.mountdrive.plist and load it by running sudo launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.mountdrive.plist (unload by changing the subcommand to bootout)\nWhen I have this daemon loaded and I plug in a portable storage device, I can hear my Mac say 'drive mounted' (turn up the volume or invoke another utility to test it yourself).\nThis watches for any changes in the /Volumes directory, which is where drives show up. Sadly this also means that this gets triggered whenever a device get UNmounted, and also when you plug in a device it gets triggered once and again when the mount is finished properly. Even though this means the event gets triggered more often than you said you want, I think that you can use this daemon to call a shell script to double-check whatever changed in the /Volumes is an event that you care about, and then perform the action that you want.\n", "Q: How to make notification but no noise when timer goes off? Using the timer in the clock app, how can I make it so that there is a notification and maybe even vibration, but no noise, when the timer goes off? All the options I can see are for audible ringtones. When I change it to \"stop playing\" there is no notification either.\n\nA: This website describes a way to create a ringtone using only your iPhone.\nI achieved a silent timer on iOS 15.6 using GarageBand 2.3.12.\n\n*\n\n*Download Apple's GarageBand app free of cost.\n\n\n*Open the app and scroll through the start screen until you see 'Audio Recorder', open this new project.\n\n\n*Use the red record button up top to record for a short moment (stop by pressing the button again), we will make it silent later. Ensure that the recording stays under 40 seconds.\n\n\n*Open the track controls (icon showing three mixing board sliders in the top left). In the output panel move the track volume slider all the way to the left. When you play your track it should now be completely silent.\n\n\n*Export the song using the downwards pointing triangle button on the top left, and choose to export to 'My Songs'. You should now see a Files view, long-press the newly exported \"song\", tap Share, and choose Ringtone as a format. Export it using the name that you like. Press OK.\n\n\n*Go to the Clock app, and in the 'When Timer Ends' menu you should now see your silent recording at the top of the list. When the timer now ends you won't hear any sound, but will still receive a notification and feel the vibration (if enabled).\nIf you want to edit your GarageBand ringtones, before you finish step 5 above you can tap on 'Your Ringtones' to delete any you have saved.\n", "Q: 'Scale to fit below the built-in camera' option not avaliable on M2 Macbook Air I cannot find the 'Scale to fit below the built-in camera' option on my M2 Air on MacOS 12.4.\n\nAny other options?\n\nA: FaceTime can't do Full Screen, nor change its window size to fill the screen.\nThe checkbox is an option for some apps; not for all.

I open it, then share icon, then \"Save Video\". A dialog box comes up that says \"Preparing Video...\" with a progress circle underneath. Normally, the circle begins to fill up and the video is saved. In this case, it just stays as a gray circle. Several minutes later there is still no progress. Is there any way to resolve this?\nI am using iPhone 13 with more than 30 GB free and the latest iOS (15.5). I tried force-quitting the Photos app and restarting the phone. I also tried \"Add to Shared Album\" and \"Save to Files\" instead of \"Save Video\". Still the same problem.\n\nA: Depending on the size of the slideshow and your internet speed, it may take longer for the video to load (the slideshow is most likely a large file). I've had a similar issue where the progress bar for saving a video doesn't move. In my case, the progress bar didn't move until 10+ minutes later and then the progress bar immediately went green. I would suggest waiting for a longer time period (try 15 minutes) and see if it loads. During this time just leave your phone open on that loading screen and wait. If it still does not load, make sure to check Settings > Photos > scroll down to Cellular Data > make sure Cellular Data is turned on. Sometimes cellular data is preferred when downloading things if the cellular data is faster than your wifi speed.\n", "Q: How to hear just Maps' spoken directions, without triggering music/podcasts? I have my iPhone 13 Pro connected via Bluetooth to my car stereo.  Normally, I listen to podcasts or music while navigating via Maps.  The spoken directions momentarily pause the music or podcast.  Sometimes glitchy, but mostly seems to work as designed/expected.\nThe other day I was with a passenger and just wanted spoken directions.  I was having a conversation and did not want to hear the podcast.  I just wanted spoken directions and silence.  Except for Apple Maps spoken directions, I do not want anything else playing during my trip.\nThis simple thing seems to be impossible to do.  After each spoken direction, my podcast resumes, forcing me to manually hit the stop button on the car stereo.\nForce-quitting the Podcast app made no difference.  After the next spoken direction, my last podcast just resumes playing.\nWhat is going on here?  Why is it impossible to just hear spoken directions and nothing else??\nMy issue is very similar to this, but \"solution\" here does not seem to work:\nCarPlay starts playing music after activating Siri even if no music was playing before\n\nLike the answer below and other online sources, it's suggested to disable cellular data for the Music and Podcast apps.  I tried that.  It makes no difference.  The Podcast is already saved on my phone and it just resumes playing.  So far, no viable workarounds or solutions.\n\nA: Found this link: How to Stop iPhone From Auto-Playing Music In Car, that possibly contains a correct solution. Specifically, the 1st solution that says:\nDisable Autoplay in Car’s Infotainment System\nFor this you need to access the settings of your Car’s infotainment system and see if there is an option to disable or Turn OFF Auto-Play.\nHowever, if this first solution does not work for you, I believe the best possible solution will be to disable the use of Cellular Data within the Apple Music app and the Podcasts app (depending on which apps you use for podcasts/music). This will prevent the music from playing but still allow you to use Apple Maps. Here is a guide on how to disable Cellular Data for the Apple Music app (scroll to solution #6).\nI also found this link: Prevent Apple Music from Auto-Playing with CarPlay that says \"there is no native way to disable Apple Music from playing when it connects to CarPlay\", which leads me to think that it is not natively possible to stop Podcasts from playing automatically either. Either way, if you use the second solution I mentioned and disable the use of Cellular Data for Apple Music, it will most likely fix your problem.\n", "Q: How can I configure a key to \"Start Dictation\" with a Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard? I have a Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard paired to my MacBook Pro over Bluetooth.\n\nmacOS has detected the keyboard as an \"Ergonomic Keyboard.\" When I go to the keyboard settings and click \"Modifier Keys...\", it thinks I have a  instead of Fn. But this keyboard doesn't have a  (as far as I'm aware), and it does have an Fn. Pressing Fn toggles a light on and off on the key.\nHere are the \"Modifier Keys...\" options:\n\nKeyboard settings:\n\nThe problem is that pressing Fn twice does not start dictation. Instead, it just toggles Fn light on and off. I'm not 100% sure how this works, but maybe this is actually just toggling an internal state inside the keyboard. Maybe it doesn't send a keypress event until you actually press one of the function keys (e.g. F1, F2), and the Fn state just determines if it sends a plain F1 key, or one of the special functions (e.g. mute, play/pause, etc.)\nIs it possible to configure Fn to start dictation? Is it possible to change a setting on the keyboard to disable the Fn light turning on and off, and send a Fn /  keypress event instead?\nI installed Karabiner-Elements and played around with it, but I couldn't figure out how to change the behavior of Fn or remap it. I was able to remap the right Windows as Fn, so I'm able to start dictation by pressing this key twice. But I would still be interested to know if it's possible to use the Fn.\n\n\nA: I finally figured out a decent solution with Karabiner-Elements. I just found out that it supports complex rules with variables, conditions, and delays, so I was able to customize the behavior of the Enter key on my keypad.

Save the file to your home directory: ~/double_tap_keypad_enter_to_double_tap_fn.json\nOpen a terminal and run these commands:\nmkdir -p ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/\nmv ~/double_tap_keypad_enter_to_double_tap_fn.json ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/\n\n(The ~/.config directory is usually hidden from Finder and the \"Save File\" window, so it's easier to use the terminal for this step.)\nGo to the Complex Modifications page and click Add Rule. (You don't need to restart Karabiner-Elements if it's already running, it should find the new JSON file immediately.)\n\nYou should see the new rule. Click \"Enable\".\n\nFinally, make sure your keyboard settings are correct. (In case you've been trying a few other things before finding this solution.)\nOpen the System Preferences and click \"Keyboard\".\nMake sure the dictation shortcut is configured correctly: \"Press  to Start Dictation (Press  twice)\"\n\n\nSide note: The Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard doesn't actually have a  Globe key, but this is just the Fn key with a different name and icon.\n\nNow click \"Modifier Keys\":\n\nYou should see the virtual Karabiner keyboard driver, and the Globe () key should be set to  Globe.\n\nThe rule is now active, so open your text editor and try it out. When you press the keypad enter key once, you should see a new line after a short delay. When you press it twice, it should start dictation.\nPlease feel free to modify this rule and choose your own key, or change all of the logic. I hope this example can help you get started with your own customizations. Make sure you check out some of the other examples in the documentation, and read the \"complex modification\" documentation to see all the things you can do with Karabiner-Elements.\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: Forward foo:8080 to localhost:8081 while keeping localhost:8080 available To emulate the CI integration testing environment for the application that I’m working with, I want to be able to have the following mapping of requests happen:\n\n*\n\n*foo:8080 ⟶ localhost:8081\n\n*bar:8080 ⟶ localhost:8080\n\nWithout the port change, I can do this easily enough by editing /etc/hosts¹ to define foo and bar to be 127.0.0.1, but the port forwarding has me stumped.

My question is in two parts:\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to deploy an application to my iPhone without using an AppleID? - I don't want to associate my personal apple ID in any way with my work laptop, and since my company set me up with a local account I don't have a company apple ID either.\n\n*If I give an Apple ID to XCode, will it link that Apple ID to any other part of the macbook (eg. assign it to my local account in Users & Groups, log in toiMessage, iCloud, App Store etc) or is it completely contained inside XCode/the XCode project?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Not in any easy manner\n\n*No - you have to enter your Apple ID in each place and setting and application unless you consent to easy setup when making a new account or when the OS is new.\n\nMy general recommendation, is make a work AppleID if you are paid to develop and never use your personal iCloud on any work development or device, ever.

However, I want to fully uninstall/delete it because it's taking up a massive amount of storage. However, I am concerned that if I drag the app into Trash and delete it from Trash, it won't delete all of the files associated with it. Specifically, there are files associated with the UTM app that are stored in /Users/user/Library/Containers/UTM that take up around 40gb and I want to make sure these files are deleted as well. I would have tested this by simply putting UTM in the trash and then taking it out again, but I am concerned because I had a similar issue a few years ago with a completely different application and it did not delete the associated files, so I ended up having weird file errors/command missing errors on my Mac and spending many hours of research and consulting before I was finally able to manually delete dozens of files by hand.\nI also found this free app called AppCleaner which supposedly solves my issue.

Run the app in the link.\n/Applications/OtherName.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp\n\nYou may want to create a script in your path to facilitate starting the app.\nYou may also need to supply arguments to the app so that two instances run without conflicting each other. In my particular example, the application was DBeaver, eg.\n/Applications/OtherName.app/Contents/MacOS/dbeaver -data ~/Library/DBeaverData/someworkspace &>/dev/null &\n\n", "Q: Horizontally scrolling a PDF without going back to previous webpage in Safari I am having frequently the following problem: I click on a click to open a PDF in Safari; I zoom into that PDF; I need to pan left on the PDF, and instead of using my arrow keys I naturally try to scroll with my mouse pad; Safari then interprets this as me scrolling back to the previous webpage, and instead of panning the document horizontally I am taken back to the page I got to the PDF from. How do I prevent this?\n\nA: Click the Apple Logo on the top left of the screen, click System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures > Swipe Between Pages. Here, you can customize the settings for the feature that you are referring to. I personally turned this setting off because it causes the issue you mentioned. However, if you would like to keep this feature on, you should choose the \"3 Finger Swipe\" option so that you are still able to move left and right on a pdf.\n", "Q: Applescript search and delete specific Mac Text Messages Hackers have daily targeted my Mac Messages app. I get a dozen or so messages daily from similar but slightly differing handles.\nFor example:\n\nAll of the handles using an email address has consistently utilized \"pqe@icloud.com\" at the end of the address. Yet, last week, these hackers are now using phone numbers too. So I can't programatically search for messages by handle now that email and phone number is used.\nHowever, the message body copy is the same:\n\n\"Hello there\"\n\nCan I use actionscript to specifically target any message with \"Hello there\" string, then delete it without all the modal windows asking if I am sure, or if I want to report spam? And also a schedule the script to run every minute or so?\nThank you so much!\nBruce\n\nA: I've been getting the exact same messages - about 30 per day, from random looking iCloud addresses which usually take the form of name.random-characters.pqe@icloud.com, but can also be cellphone numbers. They mostly arrive during the evening and overnight. I've tried \"Report Junk\" but it doesn't seem to do anything, and blocking the sender doesn't work because it's rarely the same sender twice. It's really frustrating!\n\nShort of contacting Apple support the best thing to do is to keep reporting them as spam in the app.\n", "Q: Virtualized macOS via UTM will not allow sign in to the App Store for installation of Xcode? I've installed macOS 12 via UTM on an M1 Max, but when I attempt to download Xcode from the App Store with my Apple ID account, it fails to authenticate each time.\nIs there a known issue that's blocking the App Store from working in virtualized guests by way of the Apple virtualization technology on Apple Silicon?\n\nA: Yes. There is an 'entitlement restriction' which prevents Apple ID related actions in VMs.\nHoward Oakley covers it in his series on Virtualisation on Apple Silicon\nThe Entitlement Restriction refers to the ability of the VM to use bridged or NAT networking. The former requires the entitlement from Apple (which I think applies to the entitlements granted to UTM), and would support Apple ID use, the latter (NAT), while freely available, won't support Apple ID.\nSee Networking in https://eclecticlight.co/2022/07/04/virtualisation-on-apple-silicon-macs-1-how-well-does-it-work/\nThough, UTM does allow a switch to bridged networking in a VM's configuration. I haven't tried with a Monterey VM, but feel free.\nUpdate\nI've tried a Monterey VM in UTM in both shared and bridged network settings. Neither allow the logon with an Apple ID, as you experienced. Maybe as Apple VM, and the applications, mature, it will be feasible. UTM may not have been able to get the entitlements granted. Maybe Apple has something up it's sleeve in Ventura, but now I'm speculating...\n", "Q: Send email from command line (macOS Monterey 12.3) I'm trying to send an email from the command line but it does not work:\necho \"Hello World\" | mail -s \"Test email\" someone@example.com\nYears ago \"it just worked\" because mail would (apparently) use an smtp server from Mail.app and send the email.\nThere are two working smtp servers in Mail.app (iCloud and my ISP on port 25) but still mail cannot send email from the command line.\nWhat's going on?\n\nA: OK, it works now. I'll leave this report for posterity.\nWhen using mail from the commandline, postfix has to be configured properly. It does not seem to get its smtp server settings from Mail.app (maybe it used to, but not any longer). You have to set these yourself.\nThe relevant documentation can be found here: http://www.postfix.org/SOHO_README.html#fantasy\nThese settings work:\n# Set external SMTP relay host here, IP or hostname accepted along with a port\nrelayhost = smtp.myispserver.com:465\n# Set username and password\nsmtp_sasl_password_maps = static:myusername:mypassword\n# Enable auth\nsmtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes\nsmtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous\n# Turn on tls encryption\nsmtp_tls_security_level = encrypt\nheader_size_limit = 4096000\n\n# For port 465\nsmtp_tls_wrappermode = yes\nsmtp_tls_security_level = encrypt\n\n# For rewriting mymacusername@mymacname.home to myusername@myisp.com\nsmtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic\n\nIf outgoing port 25 is blocked, use 465 or 587.\nMy suspicion that the smtp server refused to accept connections with incorrect sender \"From: \" headers was right. The response was: Sender address rejected: Domain not found (in reply to RCPT TO command).\nUse smtp_generic_maps to rewrite.\nCheck smtp and smtpd logs with:\nlog stream --predicate  '(process == \"smtpd\") || (process == \"smtp\")' --info\n\n\nA: Found this reddit thread that discusses the issue and offers this solution:\n\"If you have Mail.app configured with an account, you can do the following:\necho \"Hello World\" | mail -s \"BCC Testing email\" someone@example.com -c second@example.com -b third@example.com\nThe -c is for carbon copy and -b for blind copy.\"\nAlso, people in this thread say that you need a utility to do this and recommend Sendemail. If Mail.app still isn't working for you after trying the solutions, try using Sendemail and see if it makes a difference.\n", "Q: Incorrect Boot Camp Delete I tried to remove some space from the Boot Camp partition and return it to the Mac partition using MiniTool Partition Wizard. It required me to restart my Mac to have it work (MiniTool Partition Wizard is in Boot Camp).\nOnce I reloaded, it showed an error, so I thought I may have taken away too much from Boot Camp, making it not able to show, so I just went into Mac, opened Disk Utility, and took away all of the space from Boot Camp and gave it all to Mac.\nAfter that, I want to reinstall Boot Camp but the software would be stuck in the Install screen, not really loading:\n\nI checked holding Option while opening my Mac, and it still shows Windows, however, when I click into it, it just shows an error screen. I have also tried using terminal diskutil list but couldn't find the microsoft disk.\nAny input would be helpful.\n\nA: The posted image shows the Boot Camp Assistant is stuck at the step where the Windows Support Software should be downloading from Apple. Sometimes the download can take a while to complete. Other times, there can be problems, with the connection or Apple servers, resulting in being stuck at this step. You may be able to solve the problem by trying again later.\nUsing the Disk Utility to remove the Windows partition does not necessarily remove the Windows boot code. Therefore, the option to select Windows may still appear when \"holding Option while opening my Mac\".\n", "Q: Does transfering data to a new iPhone from old iPhone keep all app state? Let's say I bought the latest iPhone.\nI migrate my data from my old iPhone to the new iPhone.\nWhat does the transfer does to my banking app for example?\nWill I still be logged in the new iPhone or it will consider the banking app to a freshly new installed app?\n\nA: This depends on the app, as apps can mark keychain items and files as being contained to the current device. Those items and files are not transferred.\nEspecially banking apps make use of this to tie the app instance to a device; after migrating to a new device you often have to re-authenticate. See the support page of your banking app for details.\n\nA: Apps with logins will usually log you out, so get all the login info before you delete the old phone data. I recently transferred my data from an old iPhone to a new iPhone and found that Apple has a newer method to transfer data that will make it easier and retains the data for most apps.\nBefore doing this method, I recommend you go to your iPhone Settings > click on your name/profile at the very top > iCloud > make sure everything setting is turned on for backup. Do not worry about buying iCloud storage, they have a new feature that gives you enough iCloud storage so that you can transfer data to your new phone. Here is a link to the Apple article explaining exactly how to do this.\nFor me, all my apps were normal and still had the same exact data where I last left off (even some apps that I thought would reset the score/reset my progress got saved because I turned on all settings in the iCloud section I mentioned).\nAlso, do not reset/delete your old iPhone data until you have 100% confirmed all your data and apps are in your new phone. Trust me, check every app, make sure everything is good before deleting your old phone data because there are multiple ways to still recover that old phone data if it did not transfer properly.\n", "Q: Maximize the system preferences window How do I maximize the system preferences window?\nSpecifically I am creating a Siri Shortcut to take a screenshot of the screen time window, extract the text from it and paste it in spreadsheet.\nSo, I would like to maximize the screen time window.\nBut there appears to be no option.\n\nA: It cannot be resized.\nIt sizes to fit its contents and has no other option.\n\nA: System Settings.app in macOS Ventura can be resized vertically (not horizontally).\n", "Q: Time Machine external HDD backup drive won't mount, freezes system UI I have a Western Digital Passport 2TB external HDD that I use for Time Machine backups. I formatted it using APFS and it is encrypted. I've used it for around 2 years now, backing up every week.\nWhen I now attach it to my MacBook Pro 16\" 2019 running Monterey 12.5, it doesn't mount. The drive spins up and I don't hear any abnormal sounds. Disk Utility and commands like diskutil freeze until I pull the device out. Finder also becomes incredibly slow.\nI don't think the device itself is damaged, and the backups don't really matter to me if I can simply reformat the drive. The problem is nothing can actually identify the device without freezing.\nIs there a solution, preferably free, to repair the drive or reformat it?\n\nA: I couldn't get it to work or format on a Mac or Linux laptop without freezing the system. I checked the HDD's SMART status through BIOS and found no issues.\nMy solution was to use Windows's Disk Management to delete the partition and temporarily formatted it as exFAT. On MacOS I then reformatted it to APFS and it has been working fine.\nThe volume must have become damaged at some point and macOS couldn't handle it.\n", "Q: Block Incognito mode in any browser Is there any way to close the Incognito window automatically as soon as it is opened on any browser?\nI am currently using the Arc browser by the Browser Company which is based on Chromium but I couldn't get a command like Chrome to disable it.\n\nA: you are asking wether it is possible to disable incognito mode system wide on MacOS, iOS or iPadOS? No. It is not possible.

AppleScript, CLI, etc I'm looking to retrieve a list of my Apple devices via FindMy.\nAt the minimum, I want to retrieve my phone's location. Best case scenario, I'd like to get the location of all of my devices (Mac, Watch, AirTags, etc, etc) as well as their battery levels. This seems possible as the information is available via the FindMy app as well as through the web interface https://www.icloud.com/find/. Ideally, I'd like a way to programmatically retrieve this information. I'm pretty flexible as far as the output. I'm retrieving things like Contacts, Reminders, and Calendar already using AppleScript- but I'm not seeing a way to get FindMy info. I'm a developer and very comfortable with code and terminal, so I'm open to getting a little gritty if need be.\nDoes anybody have any leads on how to go about getting this data? Worst case I'm thinking I can attempt to scrape the web interface, but would prefer to use a slightly more official means, if possible.\n\nA: There's no official API for accessing the data you seek.\nAs you mention, one possible method of retrieving this information would be to simply web scrape it from Apple's iCloud web site. However, you should note that this site does not offer all the information you seek - in particular for example the locations of AirTags are not exposed there.\nAnother method, which also makes it possible to get to the locations of AirTags, is to use private APIs on a Mac to access the information via Apple's own code. Luckily, others have already researched this option and created open source code for that purpose.\nAs accessing the private APIs require a specific entitlement, the most common way forward is to tag on to Mail.app as a plug-in, which makes it possible to run code with that entitlement. You can find the source code for such a plugin here:\nhttps://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/tree/main/OpenHaystack/OpenHaystackMail\n", "Q: Mu fails to install and Mu4e fails to start: /usr/local/opt/emacs not present or broken I upgraded mu and emacs and now mu4e stopped working.\nI removed Emacs with:\nbrew uninstall --force emacs\nbrew uninstall --force homebrew/cask/emacs\n\nand mu with:\nbrew uninstall mu\n\nThen I installed emacs again with:\n$ brew install homebrew/cask/emacs\nRunning `brew update --auto-update`...\n==> Downloading https://emacsformacosx.com/emacs-builds/Emacs-28.1-4-universal.dmg\n==> Downloading from https://emacsformacosx.com/download/emacs-builds/Emacs-28.1-4-universal.dmg\n######################################################################## 100.0%\n==> Installing Cask emacs\n==> Moving App 'Emacs.app' to '/Applications/Emacs.app'\n==> Linking Binary 'Emacs' to '/usr/local/bin/emacs'\n==> Linking Binary 'ebrowse' to '/usr/local/bin/ebrowse'\n==> Linking Binary 'emacsclient' to '/usr/local/bin/emacsclient'\n==> Linking Binary 'etags' to '/usr/local/bin/etags'\n==> Linking Manpage 'ebrowse.1.gz' to '/usr/local/share/man/man1/ebrowse.1.gz'\n==> Linking Manpage 'emacs.1.gz' to '/usr/local/share/man/man1/emacs.1.gz'\n==> Linking Manpage 'emacsclient.1.gz' to '/usr/local/share/man/man1/emacsclient.1.gz'\n==> Linking Manpage 'etags.1.gz' to '/usr/local/share/man/man1/etags.1.gz'\n  emacs was successfully installed!\n\nand mu with:\n$ brew install mu\nWarning: You are using macOS 10.14.\nWe (and Apple) do not provide support for this old version.\nYou will encounter build failures with some formulae.\nPlease create pull requests instead of asking for help on Homebrew's GitHub,\nTwitter or any other official channels.

I bought a Mac recently and I am very new to Mac. The seller says its 512 GB but from the screenshots below I don't know if its 512 GB or 256 GB please kindly let me know.\n\n\n\nA: That system has 256 GB of storage.\nAccording to both of those screenshots you do not have 512 GB storage on that Mac. There is only 256 GB of storage.\nThe easiest way to see this is via the “About This Mac > Storage” tab screenshot you have posted.\n\nThe two areas you can see it is in the text beneath the storage icon that reads “251 GB Flash Storage” as well as the calculation graph with the text that reads “224.71 GB available of 245.11 GB.”\nAnd, if you care, the difference between 251 GB and 245.11 GB can be explained by the spaced taken up the recovery partition as well as Time Machine snapshots. So 245.11 GG is normal for a 256 GB storage device like this. But it sure as hell isn’t 512 GB storage as the seller claimed it is!\n\nA: If your seller has just run df to check the size and naively taken the largest figure, then that's maybe why they reckoned it was 512GB.

I tried booting from Startup Manager, expecting the Apple logo to appear and the CD to boot from the installer, but I got a grey screen for a long period of time, and then I saw a folder icon with a question mark briefly, then it changed to a Finder icon, then froze, however the disc was still spinning in the drive. I tried it on my PowerBook G4 Titanium. Saw an Apple logo, but then KERNEL PANIC. Do you think these 2 computers are compatible with Mac OS X Jaguar? (according to the readme file in the disc, I believe it mentioned it was compatible with PowerBook G4 and iBook models) or did I get a corrupted copy of Jaguar?\n\nA: According to everymac.com, the earliest iBook G4 12-inch requires at least OS X 10.3. Therefore, you should not expect to boot from Jaguar (OS X 10.2).\nJaguar is compatible with some (but not all) PowerBook G4 Titanium models.\n", "Q: Uninstalling useless dependencies from a partially-installed failed MacPorts package I tried to install the xfce package on MacPorts, which has about a hundred dependencies. It got pretty far, but ultimately the install failed due to whatever reason, about 85 dependencies in. So I'd like to uninstall the entire thing, in particular the 85 useless dependencies which I no longer need.\nThe problem is that if I try sudo port uninstall xfce, it doesn't do anything. Neither does sudo port uninstall --follow-dependencies xfce, sudo port uninstall --follow-dependents xfce and so on. From what I can tell, this seems to be because MacPorts doesn't think that xfce is installed at all, since the installation never finished, so it doesn't try to uninstall anything. I've also tried sudo port clean --all installed and it didn't seem to do much.\nWhat did do something is scrolling up to the beginning, when I tried to install the package, and looking at the list of dependencies it said it was going to install and manually uninstalling each one. For instance, I scrolled up to this:\n$ sudo port install xfce\n--->  Computing dependencies for xfce\nThe following dependencies will be installed:\n Thunar\n apr\n apr-util\n at-spi2-atk\n at-spi2-core\n atk\n...\n\nAnd then typed\nsudo port uninstall Thunar apr apr-util at-spi2-atk at-spi2-core atk ...\nwhich did it. But is there some better way to do this?\n\nA: Macports tracks if a port was explicitly requested by you (ie an argument to port install) or if it was loaded because another port needed it.\nTo clean up you need two stages.\n\n*\n\n*Remove the xfce port by port uninstall and port clean. But if one of the ports xfce failed then this step is not needed as nothing of xfce was acted on.\n\n\n*Remove all the unrequested and unneeded ports. This is all in the Macports Guide\nThe unrequested can be seen by port list unrequested but this includes ones that might be required by other ports.\nThe command that lists all the ports that you have not requested and don't have ports dependent on them is port echo leaves You then need to uninstall these.\nLuckily there is code to do this but not as part of the base Macports install.\nYou need to install a package and then run it.\nsudo install port_cutleaves and then sudo port_cutleaves This finds the current leaves and asks if you want to uninstall each one in turn. When that has done it then asks if you want to uninstall a new set of leaves that have been uncovered.\n", "Q: External hard drive won't eject because of QuickLook I have an external hard drive that is APFS encrypted, but I also tested this with an APFS drive that is not encrypted.\nSimply put, I mount my hard drive, view some files via quicklooking (press space on the item) or launch them into VLC, then eject the drive. There is a catch, and that most of the times I do this, I have to force quit all quicklook tasks via activity monitor. The error actually just says it's being used (doesn't say what task) and gives me a prompt to wait, cancel, or force eject.\nSo, how can I make it so quicklook isn't always preventing my hard drive from ejecting and 'yank it out' preferably shouldn't be a solution. None of the files are applications, but dmg files that I look through, and yes; I've ejected everything or closed every window before ejecting the drive.\n\nA: Before trying to eject your hard drive, make sure none of the files you \"quicklooked\" from your external hard drive are currently selected.\nIf any of the files from your external hard drive are currently running in VLC or any other app., those files need to be closed before you can eject the external hard drive.\nIf you still cannot eject your external hard drive after my first 2 suggestions. open Terminal.app and enter this command killall -KILL Finder\nThat will kill and relaunch Finder, which should also kill any stubborn quick look processes which are stopping you from ejecting your external hd.\nIf this happens often enough, you may consider creating a new Automator quick action and add a \"Run Shell Script\" command to the workflow and use the code from above.  Then you could assign a keyboard shortcut to your new Quick Action, in System Preferences.\n\n\nA: I don't have an answer for how to prevent QuickLook from keeping a file on the disk open in the first place; this has been a bug with QuickLook for a very long time.\nI have to execute this command every time QuickLook prevents eject:\nkillall -9 QuickLookSatellite\n\nThen I can eject the disk.\n", "Q: Turn off receiving emails from main iCloud email address?

I noticed in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions it states:\n\nYou may use the Services and Content only for personal, noncommercial purposes (except as set forth in the App Store Content section below).\n\nI looked at the App Store Content section and didn't find anything relevant to my question. Based on the statement excerpted above, it sounds like I cannot generate revenue from any iOS apps that I develop using XCode from the App Store (since XCode would fall under an Apple Media Service). Am I understanding this correctly?\n\nA: I assume this is about https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html. From the first paragraph there:\n\nThis Agreement governs your use of Apple’s Services (“Services” – e.g., and where available, App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News, Apple News+, Apple One, Apple Podcasts, Apple Podcast Subscriptions, Apple TV, Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Game Center, iTunes), through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to content, Apps (as defined below), and other in-app services (collectively, “Content”).\n\nSo these T&C apply to the use of media/content services provided by Apple (movies, music etc), not to software development.\n\nA: To answer your headline question:\nYes, you can definitely develop iOS apps using Xcode that will generate revenue for you from the App Store!\nHowever, in order to be able to do so, you must first enroll in the Apple Developer Program. It has a separate set of terms and conditions, and they will allow you to generate revenue from sales in the App Store.

For an illustration of a crontab entry which uses ~, see the top rated answer to Get low battery notifications for mouse earlier.\nYou can also test a simple example with this crontab entry:\n* * * * * touch ~/NOT_A_FILE_I_CARE_ABOUT.txt\n\n\nA: ~ is a symbol shells automatically expand to $HOME, a standard /bin/sh (which cron uses to run the commands) does not need to support ~ expansion. The portable way is to use $HOME instead in your crontab file.\n\nA: Some shells support ~, and some don't. Perhaps Apple uses dash as the default cron shell in Catalina, and bash in Monterey?; perhaps Apple changes the cron environment depending upon the phase of the moon?\nBetter than guessing what Apple has (or has not) done on some particular version of macOS, and on a machine that may or may not have user modifications... wouldn't it be better to run some simple tests - ask cron to tell you something about its environment? This would be an objective truth; one that requires no assumptions, and is not dependent upon vagaries in Apple's documentation.\nOnce a day (or whenever you wish), you can run a cron job that logs its environment and some other useful information from your system to a file. The file is always there, and its never more than 24 hours old (assuming your system was operating at the time you scheduled it).\nA job similar to the one below in your crontab would answer your questions \"definitively\" (however see NOTE 3. below):\n0 12 * * * (echo $(date); echo \"What is '~'?:\" ~; printenv) > /Users/seamus/mycronenv.txt 2>&1\n\nThis produces a file named mycronenv.txt in my $HOME directory that looks similar to this:\n\nSat Jul 30 23:35:00 CDT 2022\nWhat is '~'?: /Users/seamus\nSHELL=/bin/sh\nMAILTO=\nUSER=seamus\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin\nPWD=/Users/seamus\nSHLVL=1\nHOME=/Users/seamus\nLOGNAME=seamus\n_=/usr/bin/printenv\n\nAs you can see, my system's (Catalina) cron recognizes ~ as $HOME. To verify this, I added another job to my crontab (see NOTE 1. below):\n* * * * * (echo \"Write this line to the file ~/testdir/testfile with a timestamp: \"; echo $(date)) >> ~/testdir/testfile.txt 2>&1\n\nWhich worked as expected, writing the result to $HOME/testdir/testfile.txt.\nAnd since I used the append form of the redirect (>>), it adds a new entry every minute - i.e. remove this job after your test!\nHope this helps clear the confusion - please let us know if the issue persists, or you have other questions.\n\nNOTES:\n\n*\n\n*If you want to try this on your machine, create the directory testdir first:\n% cd\n% mkdir testdir\n\n\n\n*On my system (Catalina), Apple has set the default configuration to send mail to me with a note re my cron job - which is not something I want. Consequently, I have added a line to my crontab to disable that:\nMAILTO=\"\"\n\n\n\n*Wrt defitively:\nFrom man sh it seems that, rather than being definitive, Apple has given themselves some latitude: cron may use any one of three shells (bash, dash or zsh) in service of /bin/sh:\n\nsh is a POSIX-compliant command interpreter (shell).  It is implemented by re-execing as either bash(1), dash(1), or zsh(1) as determined by the symbolic link located at /private/var/select/sh.  If /private/var/select/sh does not exist or does not point to a valid shell, sh will use one of the supported shells.\n\n", "Q: How to determine what process plays relaxing jazz music on MacOS Monterey 12.4? My computer(macOS Monterey 12.4, Apple M1 Max) occasionally starts playing some relaxing jazz music. I don't have any players running or at least the task bar doesn't show anything. The computer has Slack and Zoom installed. Once this music started during a Zoom meeting.\nThe fix so far is to restart. I want to determine what process is playing this and to stop through the terminal.\n\nA: I would suggest first going through your open windows to see if you should have some program there that is playing the music. It could for example be coming from a browser tab. If you're using Safari, those tabs are usually marked clearly with a small speaker icon.\nIf you're not able to locate the process using this method, you can go through each running program one by one, temporarily pausing each one to see if the music stops. Do that by first opening up Activity Monitor to identify running programs.\nAt first I would use the View menu to select Windowed Processes - the list is usually much shorter, and it is likely to be one of those programs. When you have gone through this list without luck, I would advance to Active Processes, then My Processes - and eventually trying All processes.\nNow that you have a list of potential culprits, open up Terminal.app and go through the list one by one, writing the following command to pause a program:\nkill -STOP <PID>\n\nwhere  should be replaced with the number listed in the \"PID\" column in Activity Monitor. For example with actual numbers, it could look like this:\nkill -STOP 72104\n\nIf the music does not stop playing, you can resume the program again with this command:\nkill -CONT <PID>\n\n", "Q: How can I paste from my Android clipboard? On my previous Android (OnePlus) phone, my Mac's right-click menu would include \"paste from ONEPLUS...\" which was very handy. However, I have no recollection how I set this up - it just seemed to work.\nMy newer Android phone is not presenting this option; are there any settings in macOS pertinent to this to allow clipboard sharing with other devices?\n\nA: @tetsujin is correct. It would have to be a third-party app for Android that was on the previous device.\nThe service that your Mac uses to do that, along with KVM functions, is called Universal Control, you can find it in System Settings > Displays. It works seamlessly with Apple devices on the latest OS versions, but it does require all to be logged into the same AppleID.\nDo a Google search for \"Universal Control for Android\" or \"Universal Control alternatives\" to see what may be available.

Eventually I upgraded to Big-Sur and used it for nearly a year, but very occasionally it would do minor weird things causing the computer to run slow, or have applications not respond.\nEventually I thought, I need to do a clean install of MacOS, maybe that will fix these bugs.\nI did that two weeks ago, but I have realized it was a bad idea. The iMac is doing really weird things now. Now, about half the times I reboot it, or after I wake it up from sleep, it starts crashing. I usually have to trigger it a few minutes later by quickly interacting with two applications. For example, it's usually something like, I'll open my browser and while the app is opening and loading the data, I'll do something else like open another application or finder window, and this can trigger it to go crazy. But once it starts with the spinning loading cursor, it just doesn't seem to fix until I manage to reboot the iMac. What's really annoying is that because it's freezing, it takes about 10-20 minutes to actually reboot. I try and click the Apple symbol in the top left, but it takes two minutes to open etc.; each step taking a painful amount of time. On around three occasions I've had to just hold down the power button on the back of the iMac to force it to finish shutting down. It either shows the blank desktop background or a black screen (with the back-light on), even when I let the computer sit overnight, it doesn't fully power off on these occasions.\nSome more details which might help to diagnose what's happening is that it seems to cause problems to Finder, and the mouse and keyboard most often. Finder is usually the application to be 'not responding'. If it isn't at first, it usually is by the time I try to click things to quit the first application that isn't responding.\nThe mouse can stop working for certain applications but not for others which I find really strange. For example, I might be able to click inside an application to highlight text for example, but it won't register clicks to close the application.\nThe keyboard often stops working completely. Sometimes, switching it off and on again does resolve this. But interestingly, occasionally I get a window pop-up that says 'Keyboard Assistant' and it asks if I have a USB keyboard connected. I can't remember now what I do or what it says exactly, but I believe I click OK and ignore it because I don't have a USB keyboard connected at the time. So I guess this is coming up because it is detecting something strange with the keyboard, maybe.\nWhen the mouse and keyboard stop working, using a USB mouse and keyboard always works. Just to be clear, when I'm using the iMac normally, a second USB gaming mouse is permanently connected, and I switch to either one as needed, but the Apple keyboard is normally the only keyboard connected.\nI'm wondering if the mouse and keyboard are causing it to crash, or whether it crashes and causes the Bluetooth devices to stop working.\nDoes anyone know what I should do here? I'm tempted to wipe it again and install Catalina which was the only version that actually worked without bugs of some kind, but I don't know how much longer there will be security updates for it. I figured that I should ask here in case there's something I should do instead. Is there some tests I can do to diagnose the problem?\nIs this a common thing for an older Macs to run so badly with modern MacOS? I mean, it's really not that old, but I understand that Monterey is designed mainly for Macs with Apple silicon so might that cause it to introduce more bugs to intel Macs? And these aren't just bugs, it's constantly crashing. Also, the iMac has 8GB RAM, is that too low for this OS?\nAny information would be greatly appreciated.\nUPDATE:\nAfter Tetsujin's comment about memory. I permanently dedicated the right side of my screen to display the memory tab with Activity Monitor. When the computer crashed, I could check exactly which application was not responding, and what the used memory and SWAP was.\nThe first time I noticed problems was during a file transfer to an external hard drive. It told me an 8GB transfer of a single video file was going to 3 hours (it would usually take 10 minutes or so). Nothing was 'not responding' but I knew something was wrong. I tried to restart and as always, it took about 20 minutes to get the machine rebooted.\nThe memory readings at this point were:\nMemory Used: 4.10GB\nCached Files: 3.87GB\nSwap Used: 103 MB\n\nThese readings seem OK. The memory pressure graph was in the green.\nThe next day, I decided to manually force the memory up by opening a load of apps.\nI opened both Firefox and Brave browsers and loaded up with multiple YouTube tabs as well as a mix of other websites.\nIt took a lot for me to get the used memory to go over 6 GB. And it was working fast up to about this point, and the memory pressure graph was still green. With about 30 tabs, and lots of Applications open including both Logic Pro X and Garageband, the readings were at:\nMemory Used: 7.13 GB\nCached Files: 863.9 MB\nSwap Used: 707.0 MB\n\nThe graph now was displaying orange.\nI was now pushing a lot of memory into Swap, but I kept going. The computer was running slow, and occasionally not responding for a second but It seemed to be doing OK.\nThe highest SWAP I got was:\nMemory Used: 6.53 GB\nCached Files: 1.37 GB\nSwap Used: 2.84 GB \n\nAnd at this point, so much memory was in the SWAP that the graph showed green again.\nI'm guessing this test isn't really the same, because I wasn't using the apps too much. Maybe if it actually had to read and write a lot of data from/to memory it would have crashed?\nAnyway. I kept monitoring it over the next few days, with my typical computer use.\nA while later that day, it caused problems immediately after being woken up from sleep which seems to be the most usual time. It took 2 minutes for the lock screen to appear and the keyboard was slow to enter and verify the password.\nThe readings at this point were:\nMemory Used: 5.70 GB\nCached Files: 2.13 GB\nSwap Used: 176 MB \n\nOddly, despite having less applications open than usual, the used memory was 5.70 GB, which is the highest it went in normal use during these past days. However the memory pressure graph still displayed green. The process 'loginwindow' was not responding after a while which is what seems to cause the biggest problems when it does that. Again I tried to shutdown and it took ages and eventually displayed a message: 'Your computer restarted because of a problem. Press a key or wait a few seconds to continue starting up'. I have seen this message twice now. Often it will just blackscreen and take me back to the login screen.\nAfter the message, it started up. And the readings were:\nMemory Used: 4.49 GB\nCached Files: 3.49 GB\nSwap Used: 0 bytes \n\nAnother time, the mouse scroll stopped working on the Apple mouse (USB worked fine), but clicking and moving still worked on the Apple mouse which is strange.\nAs Tetsujin suggested, I did the boot in safe mode for recaching at this point.\nI noticed that three video files I downloaded were corrupted. Apparently this can be caused by bad RAM. I did a diagnosis boot by holding the D key at startup but it told me the system was OK.\nJust before writing this update, a great example of weirdness happened.\nWeb pages were loading slowly; Firefox was in an out of consciousness. But, as suggested, provided I wait long enough, it would always start responding again. Eventually, I had to reboot because it wasn't functional.\nAnd the readings were:\nMemory Used: 4.31 GB\nCached Files: 3.01 GB\nSwap Used: 0 bytes \n\nSurely 4.31/8.00 GB RAM usage is good and low, and Swap is obviously not being used. I don't understand cached files, is that high?\nTypically 'Memory Used' was between 3-5 GB. Only twice did I see it it go over 5.\n\nA: At a first guess, I'd say you have swap issues - something is using far too much RAM [easy on just 8GB] & the computer is swapping memory to HD. I know through personal experience those Fusion Drive iMacs have terrible HD performance. This is going to manifest as huge delays in everything you try to do. Actually, if you wait it out, eventually things will work, you just need infinite patience, resisting the temptation to click something else just to see if it will work.\nFirst, from a cold boot, hold the shift key until the login window appears [or the desktop if you have it auto-login]. This will take a long time; you might be best preparing something you can rest on the shift key while you go make tea & a sandwich ;)\nOnce you've got to the desktop, no apps should load. You'll just have Finder. Leave it like this, but don't let it fall asleep, for maybe 15-30 minutes, as it will rebuild some caches in the back ground. Whilst booted to safe mode, everything will be truly glacially slow, including simple screen re-draw - this is because many optimisations will not be loaded. Have patience with it, even more than usual.\nAfter this, reboot, set it not to reopen windows when logging back in.\nSee if things are better.\nThere may be some extra time required to finish rebuilding caches, so again be patient.\nYou may need to keep an eye on Activity Monitor, with the Memory tab showing, to see what causes this high memory requirement. Browsers can be really bad [especially Chrome; you may need to switch to Safari instead if it persists.]\nIf you set the View menu to All Processes, then sort high usage to the top, this may help, though browsers don't show all their usage in one 'block' belonging to the browser itself, each open tab has its own usage.\nIf you see overall memory usage going into orange or red, it's time to quit some high usage apps.\n\nA: First off: No, this isn't common or usual, and is indicative of a particular problem on your Mac.\nProblems come in two flavours: hardware, or software.\nA hardware problem would likely manifest itself regardless of the OS you were running, so that's less likely in this case.\nHowever, mechanical hard drives (part of the Fusion Drive) can cause slowness, particularly if they're actually failing. Multiple re-installs will also have an effect on the life of a hard drive. (Make sure you've got a good backup.)\nSystem crashes ('kernel panics') can be caused by defective hardware, though software can also cause them too.\nSoftware problems can occur when transitioning from one OS to another. Usually this is old third-party software that 'runs in the background', which you may have forgotten about, or even not realised is there. (It could be a part of some larger package.) This software could no longer work properly on the new OS.\nYou say you did a clean install -- which would normally remove any such software; though many people follow a clean install by migrating or restoring everything they had on the old disk, which negates the point.\n\nA: I ended up doing another clean install and switched to Big-Sur. It fixed the problems, but I'm still not sure why.\nPossibly it was a problem with Monterey, maybe had I just done a clean install of Monterey again it would have fixed it also, I don't know.\n", "Q: retrieve files from bricked M1max MacBook pro So, on my 2022 m1 max Macbook pro I was having an issue viewing one of my websites after an IP change on my server. I was advised to delete my DNS cache through terminal, I did  so, then I then did a reboot. After much black screen I ended up in Recovery mode with a message saying something along the lines of \"Due to a problem you need to reinstall Mac OS Monterey\" I have tried doing that 4 times now, it takes forever and eventually says \"there was an error installing the software\" or similar (sorry I know I should take note of the exact messages!)\nI believe that the solution is to wipe the disk and do a fresh install? Which is what I plan to do, however, before doing that, it appears that my last backup was one week before the problem so I would like to try and recover some files I have been working on this past week, before wiping the disk\nhere is what I have tried so far:\nPutting the M1 MacBook in share disk mode connected to a 2019 Macbook pro running Catalina.

Replicating this behaviour on this machine is not a requirement, but I would like my typing experience while programming to be the same.\nWhat can I do to avoid this change when typing?\n\nA: Don't use the \"International PC\" labelled layout unless you want an emulation of Microsoft behaviour for your 'dead keys' [which Microsoft doesn't actually have].\nUS International PC has unusual [for Mac] dead keys that emulate Windows International behaviour by not actually being 'dead' but permanently 'live'.\n\nThe two keys marked in orange will activate their 'dead key' equivalent of becoming accent keys rather than actual characters, unless you follow them with Space or punctuation - just like Windows International does.\nThe Mac's normal behaviour is to only activate these special use accents if intentionally invoked by pressing Opt [Alt] plus the dead key, followed by the letter you wish to add an accent to.\nIf you switch to the regular US keyboard, then plain keys are 'just keys'\n\nand only when you hold Opt do you get the dead key accents [& there are more of them]\n\nWhether the keyboard has a ten-key or not doesn't affect this behaviour.\n", "Q: Error: -69743: The new size must be different than the existing size I want to know how can I claim my free space to the container disk0s2\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI ⁨EFI⁩                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n                    (free space)                         60.6 GB    -\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk1⁩         60.6 GB    disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +60.6 GB    disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨Ace⁩                     15.4 GB    disk1s1\n   2:              APFS Snapshot ⁨com.apple.os.update-...⁩ 15.4 GB    disk1s1s1\n   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 268.1 MB   disk1s2\n   4:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                1.1 GB     disk1s3\n   5:                APFS Volume ⁨Ace - Data⁩              4.7 GB     disk1s4\n   6:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      1.1 MB     disk1s6\n\nWhen I run the command diskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0\nI'm facing this error ->\nError: -69743: The new size must be different than the existing size\n\nThanks!\n\nA: I suspect you will not be able to. The GPT shows a block of 60.6 GB of free space before the disk0s2 partition. When you are asking diskutil to resize the disk0s2 container to the end of available free space, its end is already at the end of the free space, so cannot fulfil your request. A partition cannot be extended backwards either from the front (as it were). At the partition table level everything has physical boundaries. It's only when a partition is labelled as an APFS container do things get more dynamic with its contents.\nIt looks like the disk was previously split into other partitions, the first of which has subsequently been erased.\nI would suggest a solid backup and a reinstall, making full use of all the space. It's been a long time since I have done any recovery work in macOS, especially with APFS, so you may need to remove the existing partitioning scheme beforehand in recovery mode. Perhaps another contributor with more experience can offer some guidance.\nIn addition, please update your original question with details of what hardware and OS version you are on. To me it looks like an Intel Mac. This will be useful for other contributors.\n\nA: Easy would be make a backup and erase install. Next hard would be to make a new APFS container from the free space.\nThen install macOS on the “free space” and choose to migrate all data from the disk0s2 system.\nOnce you’re sure migration is good, delete disk0s2 and grow the “free space” container to use all space.\nYou can’t grow a partition to space that exists before it but you can grow if the free space is listed after the container disk.\nThe error you face means there’s no free space after disk1 container.\n", "Q: Software update preference pane and manual update using terminal both hang Both software update in the Preferences Pane and the manual software update are hanging.\n\n\nWhat could be the problem?\nOSX 10.15.7\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo /bin/launchctl kickstart -k system/com.apple.softwareupdated && softwareupdate -l\n..and enter your admin password when prompted.\nYou might also need to remove the contents of /Library/Updates/.\n", "Q: iCloud email not available for Apple ID created using phone number I recently wanted to use @icloud.com email address but couldn’t find iCloud email option anywhere in my settings in iPhone and Mac. Even the webpage for iCloud email says “Unable to load email” when signed in through my Apple ID. I was super confused and got no answer on internet.\nI finally had to call Apple Support and asked them about this. Even they didn’t know much about this issue. After 1 hour of talking and the customer care representative having discussions with his superiors during the call, they narrowed down the problem to iCloud email service not availble to Apple ID created using phone number, and only available for Apple ID created using email address.  My Apple ID is based on phone number so I can never create or use @icloud.com email. It’s so ming boggling that Apple discriminates between the two types of Apple ID this much. iCloud email is a pretty important service.\nSince I couldn’t find this information anywhere on internet including Apple website, I just want to confirm whether this is true.\n\nA: This doesn’t surprise me on bit when you think of how to manage spam and identity at scale. On one hand, I’m sure Apple wants to allow people an easy on boarding if they genuinely want one Apple ID and on the other hand, it has to stop the most hardened scammer that’s intent on manipulating App Store reviews, sending abusive amounts of “free mail” and laundering identity for other motive or profit.\nDid support explain how you could create a proper new Apple ID and then migrate your data to that account to use the services you desire?\nYou will have best luck if you enable TFA and attach a valid payment method to your account.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/authentication/\nJust be careful creating multiple Apple ID for different services.

According to tech-journalists is the 256 GB SSD in the new Mac Book Air slower then the 512 GB SSD:\nArticle\n\"While the M1 MacBook Pro and M1 MacBook Air have two NAND chips of 128GB each in its 256GB version, the M2 MacBook Pro – and now M2 MacBook Air – has a single 256GB NAND chip. In the first case, the M1 Macs can achieve faster speeds in parallel, while the latter fails to reach the same SSD speeds since it has only a single SSD.\"\nTherefore it is recommended to buy a Macbook Air with 512 GB or larger.\nBut: Why is a single large chip slower then two smaller chips?\nWhat's the precise reason?\n\nA: SSDs are made up of so called storage modules (NAND chips). These NAND chips can differ in size. The \"old\" M1 MacBook Air had 2x128GB to achieve the total 256GB storage, the new one only has one 256GB NAND chip, while the 512GB model has 2x256GB.\nAn end user never sees this while using a Mac, since the storage is simply presented as the total capacity.\nHaving two storage modules allows the computer to access both at the same time. I.e. imagine you have one thumb drive with 256GB capacity or two with each 128GB, but all other technical specs (i.e. read/write speed,...) are the same. In both cases your total capacity is the same. However, it is obvious that you can read data twice as fast with two thumb drives than with just one.\n", "Q: Is it safe to erase my HDD (with partition disk0s2) when trying to downgrade from Mojave to High Sierra?

Disk utility can show you the space needed for each snapshot and delete them before the scheduled time when needed.\nYou did fine by waiting, but if you need to get the space sooner, you can manage that now you know this is intentional and the name of the app to show you snapshots.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/view-apfs-snapshots-dskuf82354dc/mac\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2021/11/13/understanding-snapshot-data-in-disk-utility/\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2021/11/09/disk-utility-now-has-full-features-for-managing-snapshots/\nPay attention to the tidemarks and Private Size:\n\nPrivate Size is the size of the data only referenced by that snapshot, and is broadly similar to the amount of space which would be recovered if that snapshot were to be deleted.\n\nIn your case the GB of data would be tied up in snapshots of disk1s1 and reviewable also from the command line:\ndiskutil apfs listSnapshots disk1s1\n\n", "Q: iPhone charges really slow, when not connected to a Mac I have an iPhone 13 Mini which has a weird charging behavior.\nIf I connect it to my MBP or Mac Studio it fast charges as I would expect.\nBut if I connect to my Apple USB-C charger (I mean this one EU version of this: USB-C power supply) or if I connect it to my work Dell XPS it can take up to four hours before it is fully charged.\nAny ideas why this is happening? I had the understanding that the USB-C power supply at least should be able to fast charge the iPhone?\nI have checked the battery health and it is fine and tried multiple adapters.\n\nA: You probably have a bad Power Adapter, and the connector on your Dell XPS is slow.\nI would recommend trying charging your phone from a different Power Adapter, that should solve the problem.\n\nA: There’s four different means by which an iPhone and charger can communicate, USB-PD, USB-BC, “old school” USB, and Apple’s own BrickID.  Each standard has it’s own limits and quirks.\nPlugging an iPhone into an Apple 20 watt USB-C charger should be just as good or better than plugging into an Apple computer with a USB-C port.  Apple specs show that most any Apple computer with USB-C will be able to supply 15 watts from it’s USB-C port.  Connecting an Apple to an Apple should mean they talk all the same languages.  With 15 vs. 20 watts you may not even notice a difference in charging time, at that point the Lightning port may be the limiting factor.  Apple won’t say exactly how much power Lightning supports but testing shows it is likely 18 watts, or at least that is my recollection.  Getting a bigger power supply than what Lightning supports won’t charge the iPhone any faster.  A bigger power supply could actually charge slower than a “medium sized” power supply for reasons that get very technical very quickly, reasons that I’m not sure we need to go into.\nIt would not surprise me to see a 3rd party charger or computer charge an iPhone slowly as that could be explained by the devices not speaking the same language.  Without support for iPhone “fast charging” any charging device would fall back to the “old school” USB spec of 5 watts (or is it 4.5 watts? I forget and it’s a tiny difference regardless) which would make the charging easily 3 or 4 times longer.\nMy first suspicion would be that the power supply is damaged but it sounds like this may have been ruled out.  If that’s not the problem then perhaps the iPhone is somehow damaged.  The iPhone may have a bad wire in it somewhere or a software problem preventing communication with the power brick.  When any USB device is plugged in it goes into “old school” mode for backward compatibility, once the iPhone and charger communicate their capability properly then and only then should more power flow.  If more power flows than the communication allows then we tend to see things damaged and potentially people hurt.\n", "Q: How do I delete the Falcon client application in macOS How can i delete the Falcon app. I've tried running\nsudo rm -rf /Applications/Falcon.app\nin the terminal but that didn't work.\n\n\nA: The padlock icon indicates that the file is locked.\n\nThis could be for two reasons…\n\n*\n\n*Someone used Get Info… on the file & specifically locked it. This is simply reversible by the same method.\n\n\n*However, it's more likely that the application needs an uninstaller to remove and therefore locks itself to prevent partial uninstall by simply removing it from Finder (or in this case, Terminal).\nIt would be unwise to try override that. There are likely to be components installed elsewhere in the system that would misbehave - also be hard to find and/or delete.\n\n\n*The third alternative - having now looked up what Falcon actually is - is that your organisation's admin/IT department don't want you to be able to uninstall it without their permission. You need to log to your faculty's site & get an uninstaller ID.\nFull information on how to deinstall are on the Crowdstrike Falcon site.\n\nA: If the computer is provided by your employer or by the school, then very likely you don't have permission to delete it, and you might get in all sorts of trouble if you attempt it.\nIf you bought the system second-hand, and it's not stolen, you'll have to do a factory reinitialization, i.e. wipe the media and reinstall the OS.\nGenerally speaking, such systems are intrusive enough that without proper support in place to remove them, the only way of \"removing\" them is a wipe+reinstall.\n\nA: If you ever get permission denied errors with sudo on a Mac, the problem is almost certainly SIP. Reboot into recovery and turn that off (ignoring the overly-alarmist warnings), and then try running the command again. If it still doesn't work, then it's probably using a malware technique itself (ironic how often anti-malware does that, isn't it?), so try doing the removal itself from recovery or from another computer via Target Disk Mode.\n", "Q: Find and decode bytes containing passphrase hint (CryptoUsers structure) in FileVault Drive Encryption of HFS+ encrypted drive I had a Mac computer running macOS 10.14.6 (I believe) and set up a Time Machine backup with encryption on a hard drive. It is encrypted with HFS+ with a password and a hint. The password was stored on the local keychain and I ran backups 3 times a week.\nThen I got my computer stolen. I connect the encrypted drive to another computer and I do not see the hint (it seems an unresolved issue):\nI contacted Apple for support and visited a store, but they adamant that the hint is not on the drive, and that doing so would be a security risk. This seems backwards to me because then there is no advantage to having a hint if it only shows on the same device where you can save the password in the first place.\nBy chance I discovered that APFS drives do show a hint. As for HFS+:\n\n[the hint] is stored in the \"PassphraseHint\" entry of the \"CryptoUsers\" structure in the \"com.apple.corestorage.lvf.encryption.context\" structure in the CoreStorage XML plist on the encrypted drive. You can read the specifics here FileVault Drive Encryption\n\nThe same thread shows that this CoreStorage XML plist on the encrypted drive is encoded:\n\nThe PLIST is compressed using DEFLATE and the hint itself might be base64 encoded. You'll need to decompress the data before searching for the hint, if you want to find it manually that way.\n\nand that PLIST may be outside the encrypted partition:\n\nThe encryption context plist either the EncryptedRoot.plist.wipekey stored on the \"Recovery HD\" partition of the system disk that also contains the FileVault encrypted volume, or the XML plist-like data identified as \"com.apple.corestorage.lvf.encryption.context\" stored in the encrypted metadata, contains the encrypted VMKs necessary to unlock the encrypted volume.\n\nHow user's name can be displayed before disk is decrypted, when FileVault is turned on? handles a related question where a drive has a Preboot volume. Following those steps, I ran:\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n...\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n...\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *240.1 GB   disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Time Machine Encryped   239.7 GB   disk2s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3\n\nOffline\n                                 Logical Volume Time Machine Encryped on disk2s2\n                                 2930C7CC-4EE4-43AB-B1FB-81756A1CC0E5\n                                 Locked Encrypted\n\nFollowing one answer the hint should be in the Apple_CoreStorage volume itself. I mount that volume with:\n$ sudo mkdir /Volumes/Apple_CoreStorage\n$ sudo mount -t hfs /dev/disk2s2 /Volumes/Apple_CoreStorage\n\nand I get prompted for the encryption password in the same way as if I had mounted it:\n\nHow can I find the bytes that contain the CryptoUsers or CoreStorage XML plist on the encrypted drive, decode them with base64, and see the hint in plaintext?\n\nA: I detailed how to find the hint in my earlier answer to you here:\nWhich encrypted items show a hint?\nIn particular, the hint is NOT stored on the EFI or boot partitions. It is stored (if it is indeed stored on the drive) inside the encrypted partition (the one named \"Time Machine Encryped\" in your case).\nAs I detailed in my earlier answer, this particular information is NOT encrypted with your actual passphrase (which would have defeated the purpose of a password hint), instead it is encrypted with a different key (derived from the volume identifier). So essentially the key for decrypting the information is stored in cleartext on the the drive itself.\n", "Q: Where does macOS Big Sur store profile pics?

A simple tool in the likes of Testdisk (https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk) that would get me parts of whats on that disk would already be a great help!\nPS: MacOS 12.5. Still an Intel-Mac ;)\n\nA: There are several utilities that you can use to try to repair a corrupted disk.\nThese include DiskWarrior, Data Rescue, and Disk Drill. All of these cost money: you will have to decide whether the data is worth the cost. They may have trial modes where you can see if anything will be recovered before purchase.\nA quick Google reveals the following free file recovery tool for APFS:\nhttps://www.easeus.com/mac-file-recovery/recover-files-from-apfs-drive.html\nHowever, while APFS should normally be more reliable than older formats; and solid state drives should be more reliable than mechanical drives: they are more complex, and that means that when things do go wrong, data recovery is much more difficult.\nIt can never be repeated too often that the best defence against disk problems is to have duplicate copies on other physical volumes.\n", "Q: Giving Screen Recording permissions to a shell script called by launchd Given a shell script that calls the macOS screencapture utility, a proper screenshot (meaning, a full capture of what is on the screen, including any application windows visible) is produced when calling that shell script from the terminal. However, using launchd to periodically call the same script does not produce the desired result, in this case the screenshot only shows an empty desktop background and a menu bar. I am running macOS 12.5 Monterey.\nMy desired goal is to automatically take screenshots by using launchd to call a shell script periodically. I specifically want to call a shell script or unix executable file, and do not want to use cron or any application other than launchd for scheduling purposes.\nMy actual screenshot shell script is more involved than in the example. In the past I have been able to successfully load other daemons calling shell scripts as in the example through launchctl, but never ran into permission problems like this before.\nExample\nscreenshot.sh\n#!/bin/zsh\n\n# save as `~/Library/bin/screenshot.sh`\n# make executable by ways of the following command: `chmod +x ~/Library/bin/screenshot.sh`\n\nscreencapture -C ~/Desktop/test$( date +'%H%M%S' ).png;\n\nSave this script in ~/Library/bin/ and make it executable by calling chmod +x.\nNote that calling running this script works fine if Terminal.app (or equivalent...) has been given screen recording permissions (see 'Permissions' below).\ncom.example.screenshot.plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<!--\n  save as `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.screenshot.plist`\n  load this by ways of the following command: `sudo launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.screenshot.plist`\n  unloading this: `sudo launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.screenshot.plist`\n-->\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.example.screenshot</string>\n\n    <!-- replace <<USERNAME>> with the actual username -->\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/Users/<<USERNAME>>/Library/bin/screenshot.sh</string>\n\n    <key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>10</integer>\n\n    <key>ProcessType</key>\n    <string>Background</string>\n\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/launchd.example.screenshot_stderr.log</string>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/launchd.example.screenshot_stdout.log</string>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n\nFirst, make sure that under <key>Program</key> <USERNAME> is set to your actual username, or that the path to the screenshot.sh file is absolute. Save this .plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ and load by calling sudo launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.screenshot.plist. Unloading works by changing the subcommand to bootout. The launchctl manpage can be found here.\nPermissions\nScreen recording permissions can be given to applications in System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Screen Recording → '+'. Adding Terminal.app to this list, and restarting the application gives proper screenshots when calling screenshot.sh directly from the terminal. I have tried adding /bin/launchd, /bin/launchctl, /usr/sbin/screencapture, Terminal.app, and the screenshot script (saved without the .sh suffix) to the list of allowed apps and then rebooting, but I am still not able to produce proper screenshots through launchd.\nQuestion in short\nFor the set-up given above, what settings do I change or permissions do I give such that I get proper screenshots that show open applications?\nQuestions pertaining to the same problem have been asked here and here, but the answers aren't satisfactory (don't work or don't use launchd).\n\nA: Have been working on the same thing and finally figured it out after much digging and testing.\nI noticed in the CoreServices there is a launchservicesd app. I added this to Screen Recording permissions and it works.\nIt's located exactly here: /System/Library/CoreServices/ and you're looking for exactly launchservicesd to give permissions to.\nFor others reading this not knowing how to add these to Screen Recording, you need to use Command+Shift+G to bring up a Go menu in the Preferences to pick these specific locations.\nIn total you will need to have Screen Recording permissions for all of the following:\n/bin/bash\n/System/Library/CoreServices/launchservicesd\n/usr/sbin/screencapture\n", "Q: How to use Messages on Mac to see texts, but not allow others to iMessage me How can I use Messages.app on my MacBook to see texts that people send my iPhone, and to send texts via my iPhone. But not allow iMessages either way.\nI found the only way to disallow everyone from sending me iMessages is by signing out of Messages.app.\n\nA: iMessage depends on a cloud-sync structure - any iMessage going to your phone also goes to any other devices you own.\nIf the phone number associated with this iMessage account is also registered with other devices you own, then iCloud leverages the existing shared network to push pure SMS/MMS messages onward to your other 'non-telephonic' devices, using iMessage/iCloud, not the service provider's messaging structure.\nIf you sign out from all iMessages services, you have lost this sync mechanism.\n", "Q: MacOS 12 Monterey (M1) keeps asking my ssh passphrase every time I tried to add this to ~/.ssh/config file, but it doesn't help.

An important function of a laptop computer is charging the battery. Does the Mac OS allow the user to know how much current is being used to charge the battery? i.e. is there a Terminal command or utility or log page in which this information is exposed?\nThe answer to this question may be no.  It is okay if that is the case. Also, it is not necessary the answer be in milliamps. It may be expressed as a \"percent\" (%) or even some other term such as \"juice\"(tm), \"go stuff\"(tm) or whatever else makes it comfortable.\n\nA: Yes, macOS does \"allow\" the user to know that information.\nAn easy way to access that information is to use the third party app coconutBattery:\nhttps://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/\nIt shows you \"Charging with: xxx watts\".\nDepending on your laptop model, you can use Terminal commands such as pmset -g batt, ioreg -w0 -l and system_profiler SPPowerDataType to get information about your battery.

I don't know if the new one I was sent is a newer rev of the monitor, has a newer FW version (M2T104), or I missed a setting before (see below), but now when I put my Mac to sleep (in clamshell mode), the monitor will wake after I hit the keyboard a few times.\n\n", "Q: OS pop-up windows are unresponsive on macOS Monterey I've been having this issue for many OS versions now, where every other day, all of the OS level dialog windows (sorry I don't know the technical name for them) will become unresponsive after appearing on the screen, e.g., these two windows at the bottom here (I've also included my MacBook info at the top FYI)... \nNeither button does anything on these windows and I usually have to reset my computer for them to go away.

In this list you can grep for the PID to find the label corresponding to the process you want to investigate.\nExecuting launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/LABEL shows a bunch of information, and printed at the top you can find the path to the .plist, if the process daemon is loaded from a .plist.\nExample:\n$ launchctl list                         \nPID Status  Label\n630      0  com.apple.Finder\n...\n\n\n$ launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.apple.Finder\n...\n    path = /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Finder.plist\n...\n\n", "Q: Apple TV 4K + LG Computer Monitor: Apple remote has but loses volume control Equipment:\n\n*\n\n*Apple TV 4K with remote.\n\n*43\" inch computer monitor LG 43UD79-B 4K with built-in speakers, has its own remote.\n\nConnection:\nHDMI, from Apple TV to monitor\nProblem\nWhen I first connected the Apple TV to this monitor I was able to control the volume on the monitor using the Apple Remote.

However, the 2008 iMac only has USB 2.0 and, as such, a USB 2.0 to HDMI adapter might have poor performance, and almost certainly not be able to display HD content. Also, be aware that many of the USB 2.0 to HDMI cables (rather than adapters), that are on the market, are actually just for charging capabilities.\nYou could also just replace your built-in display using one of the many guides available, such as this one on ifixit: iMac Intel 20\" EMC 2133 and 2210 Display Panel Replacement.\n", "Q: How to have Emacs keybindings everywhere in Macbook Air M1 Monterey 12.5? Is tweaking ~/Library/KeyBindings/ the best approach? I am new to macOS and a big fan of Emacs. I am trying to achieve Emacs keybindings everywhere.\nDespite the fact that I have read multiple times on the web people stating that macOS was friendly and out of the box with Emacs keybindings, I am having some hassles. Obviously, the problems happen outside of Emacs. In Emacs, things work as expected.\nI am struggling with copy, paste, cut, for instance. But I also used to have problems with those in Linux (Ubuntu/NixOs).\nUnlike in macOS, in Linux I managed to get M-b (move back word) and M-f (move forward) to work.\nIt is possible to do it with Command-M-b and Command-M-f but I do not want to change my habbit/muscle memory. I want to make this new computer adapt to me - not the opposite.\nSome old posts (like #1, #2, #3, #4) mention a tweak on ~/Library/KeyBindings/. By the way, a lot of posts are mentioning Jacob Rus' comprehensive guide which is hosted on Harvard University domain.... But the link is broken.\nUnfortunately, I cannot even find this folder:\nPedros-MacBook-Air:Library pedro$ pwd\n/Users/pedro/Library\nPedros-MacBook-Air:Library pedro$ cd Key\nKeyboard/         Keyboard Layouts/ KeyboardServices/ Keychains/ \n\nHow to find  ~/Library/KeyBindings/ in Mac M1 Monterey 12.5?\nShould I create it?\nAlso, others posting more recent content are suggesting other alternatives, such as Karabiner-elements (#1 #2).

I have been having a great Emacs UX out of Emacs and inside a macOS thanks to Karabiner Elements.\nI have even created a GitHub repo to share my configuration for Karabiner\nI do not have the technical expertise to discuss and contrast the positive/negative aspects of each alternative. What I can state is that Karabiner-elements really improved my life.\n\nA: As for getting your mac adapting to you and your Emacs muscle memory without third-party apps, my option has been, since 2010, to add a DefaultKeyBinding.dict inside my ~/Library/KeyBindings/.\nAnd yes, I did have to make the KeyBindings directory inside ~/Library/ and move my keybindings file into it. (I don't have an M1 Mac, so I can't test it, but I don't see why that would be difficult to achieve. I have an Intel-based 2019 MacBookAir running Monterey 12.6).\nI've tweaked (in Emacs, of course) Jacob Rus' DefaultKeyBinding.dict several times since I first copied it in 2010. You can find my version in https://github.com/plgx/DefaultKeybindings.dict/tree/main\nYou can also adapt it to your needs using for reference Apple's Cocoa Event Handling Guide.\n(BTW, I'm sure Karabiner Elements is a great piece of software.

And why can I open emacs this way?\n\nA: You can run MacOS bundled programs like Firefox from the terminal using open.\nOr you can run the executable within the program bundle by executing it from its path:\n/Application/FireFox.app/Contents/MacOS/FireFox.\nStandard I/O apps in the binaries path of your shell can be executed by the name of their executable.\nOr you actually execute a shell script which opens the binary - bundled app or its executable. If you e.g. installed some program you downloaded, what exactly is done when you execute a command in your shell depends on the programm.\nSimilar you can wrap shell scripts or standard i/O programs into a bundle using e.g. Platypus.\nSelf-contained bundled programs facilitate their installation and deinstallation by allowing to do this using drag&drop in the Finder.\n", "Q: Apple Script cannot work with existing path I have to make an export from a banking app and I like to move the generated file, which is located somewhere deep inside of /tmp/..., to a folder inside documents.\ntell application \"MoneyMoney\"\n    set exportFile to export transactions from account \"DE91787695590008764648\" from date \"2022-01-01\" to date \"2022-12-31\" as \"csv\"\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set fileName to name of (POSIX file exportFile as alias)\n    set targetName to \"/Users/username/Documents/Klientendaten/AccountImport/\" & fileName\n    move exportFile as POSIX file to folder targetName as POSIX file\nend tell\n\nreturn targetName\n\nThe script editor tells something with Error in AppleEvent-Routine number -10000. I think it has something to do with targetName, which apple script can't find, but that definitively exists. Is there a mistake in targetName? Or is the move-call wrong?\n\nA: The problem is most likely where you've defined targetName: if this is a path to a file (and not a folder), asserting it later to be a folder in the move command will not be possible; if it is a path to a folder, then it almost certainly doesn't exist as it's derived from the name of the file that is exported moments before.\nHere's an amended version of the salient portion of your script:\nset targetPath to \"/Users/username/Documents/Klientendaten/AccountImport/\"\n        \ntell application id \"com.apple.Finder\" to tell (move ¬\n        (the exportFile as POSIX file) to the folder ¬\n        (targetPath as POSIX file)) as text to return ¬\n        the POSIX path\n\nI've added in parentheses to aid clarity, although the way you formulated it—even without parentheses—is fine and would work just as well.  This moves the exportFile to the folder AccountImport.  If you actually wanted to move it to a folder with the same name as the exportFile, then this folder needs to be created first:\nset targetPath to \"/Users/username/Documents/Klientendaten/AccountImport/\"\n\ntell application id \"com.apple.Finder\" \n         set exportFile to the file named (exportFile as POSIX file)\n         set targetFolder to the folder named (targetPath as POSIX file)\n         set targetFolder to make new folder in the targetFolder ¬\n                 with properties {name:exportFile's name as text}\n         move the exportFile to the targetFolder\n         return the POSIX path of (the result as text)\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Computer and Internet Extremely Slow and Fan Constantly Running Audibly: 2016 15\" Macbook Pro My computer is a 2016 Macbook Pro. The battery service warning came on, and I did my research and determined the battery was at the end of its life. At the same time the fan was always running audibly, which I read could happen with a failing battery.\nI had the battery replaced at a local shop (not apple store), and expected it to be better. Glad I did, however now the computer and internet are running extremely slow now and the fan is still constantly running audibly loud. The computer does not feel overly hot.\nI tried an SMC reset but not sure if it took because I notice no difference. I have updated to the latest OS, 12.5 because someone said there might be a software fix for a failing processor thermistor, (not sure what that means).\nThis computer is my livelihood. Looking for tips on next steps I can try without dropping it off at the apple store, which is far from here, and leaving it for an undisclosed amount of time.\nWhat steps are next to fix this?\n\nA: You have done all the good steps, and sadly you will need to get it back to the shop that swapped the battery to repeat that service or further diagnose.\nFor this I would not take it to a store. Instead order a box for, Apple online so you can time when you drop it off and have it shipped to all the parts at the depot.\nRetail store will likely slow down this specific repair three days in my experience. The only reason to take it to the retail store is if you think they can help with updates or settings. That will not be likely as you already found all the relevant steps (smc) and made the correct observations on the issue.\n", "Q: Kernel Panic - assert failed: [14083]:low wA f4 i1875522 s3180082 n16 d0 w1.6 tGC9 tL30 For the past 2 weeks, I've experienced a few Kernel Panics. When looking at the crash logs, it specifies that there was an assert fail, containing the following information: panic(cpu 1 caller 0xfffffff00bb5c154): ANS2 Recoverable Panic - assert failed: [14083]:low wA f4 i1875522 s3180082 n16 d0 w1.6 tGC9 tL30, d:0x22401, a2:0x2890041, a3:0x60000000 - power(13). I noticed it usually happens when I am performing a lot of Memory and/or CPU intensive tasks, though I don't know if there is there is any true correlation between the two. Does anybody have an idea that the specific assert means? The following link is to a pastebin with the entire crash log: https://privatebin.randomserver.xyz/?fb94ef9e6656eb9f#Ah5qpzLErBk1ZqM4egsbnqGtTaPZnokx3dQoJHdoppbJ\nEdit: I'm using an Intel MacBook Pro (2019), running macOS 12.5 (Monterey)\n\nA: I solved this problem by disabling Spotlight from indexing my Bootcamp volume. I know this sounds odd, but it worked for me. In System Preferences, open the Spotlight pane, then select the Privacy tab. Press the + button and add Bootcamp to the list of volumes that Spotlight should not search.\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/448523/470938\n\nA: Unfortunately, no-one - except Apple developers with access to the source code - can tell you what that specific assertion means.\nHowever, I can tell you that it is related to the storage subsystem on your MacBook Pro. It is likely to be a hardware error.\nI would check and double-check that you have backups of the device - and then contact Apple support with this issue. Hopefully it is an issue that can be verified using hardware testing tools, so you can get the computer repaired.\n\nA: I received a similar error two weeks ago. It started after I partitioned my storage drive to run an app on Windows 10. I believe it is related to the Mac firmware complaining about the size of a partition and resulting in a software issue related to memory block size, causing a ANS2 recoverable panic.\nDo you have a partition? If so, I would check the size. I have read that it should be a number of bytes equal to a power of 2.\nSystem Details\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)\n\n*Monterey 12.6.1\n\n*500 GB SSD\n\n", "Q: Rewind/fast-forward in the background Music app while minimised I'm trying to find a solution to fast forward a track in the Music app while it is minimised and while I'm working on another app. I got some ideas from Keyboard Maestro but not sure if the steps are right.\nI have received the following script and asked to create an AppleScript but for some reason, it's not working:\nset A to {}\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\" to if it is running and (playing of documents contains true) then set end of A to \"QuickTime Player\"\ntell application \"Music\" to if it is running and (player state is playing) then set end of A to \"Music\"\ntell application \"Spotify\" to if it is running and (player state is playing) then set end of A to \"Spotify\"\ntell application \"VLC\" to if it is running and playing then set end of A to \"VLC\"\nA\n\nIs there anything wrong here?\nI also could not save the script in the Applescript editor.\n\nA: You've asked two separate questions here, one being really vague and nothing to do with the title of the question.  Therefore, I'll focus on the question about fast forwarding the currently playing track in Music.app:\ntell application id \"com.apple.music\" to if ¬\n        player state ≠ stopped then set the ¬\n        player position to player position + 5\n\nThis advances the track forward by 5 seconds.

I bought it a year ago, and for the past few months, I have been experiencing slowness.\nWhat drives me crazy is that I can't locate what the problem is. My usual load is something like:\n30 tabs on Firefox or Edge (but not both) + Notion + Preview + Zoom + Spotify + NordVPN + Bitdefender\nIt is my first Macbook, but I can't believe this number of apps causes the problem!\nI visited an apple store, and the guy there was useless.\nI tried to restore the mac OS using \"Erase All Contents and Settings\" from the menu bar of System Preferences, but the problem persists.\nIs it the problem that 8GB of RAM on the M1 chip is not enough?\n\nA: First thing to check is Memory Pressure in Activity Monitor [Applications/Utilities] If it's green you should be fine, orange or red & you need to quit something or close some browser tabs.\n8GB is easy to choke these days.\nAlso check how full your drive is - Disk Utility is good for that. Depending on drive size you need 10-15% free space at all times, but more than that if it's a tiny drive, 128GB.\nA periodic reboot can fresh things up a bit.\nAlso note, all avtiviruses can drag on a system a bit. AV-TEST (about the closest thing to an actual authority on the subject) shows Bitdefender as being about the slowest at the moment.\n\nA: 8Gb of RAM is the minimum that Apple offers. Mac laptops first came with 8Gb in 2009; most MacBook Pros have come with 16 Gb for the last 10 years. Arguably, it's not enough for anything except light email/browsing/Office-type usage.\nThe \"OS\" is likely to need around 4Gb just to operate. (WindowServer, Finder, all the other processes...)\nYou'll be able to see in Activity Monitor what each app's usage is. It's likely that Notion is going to use at least 1 Gb; if you've got lots of images or PDFs open in Preview, that could use 1 Gb or more; 30 tabs in a browser are a lot of data. So, yes, you'll be hitting 8Gb or more.\nHaving said that, the M1s do have a reputation for dealing with swap (RAM data that 'spills over' onto the disk) very quickly.\nmacOS is designed to use as much RAM as possible; so it will try to fill whatever you have. (For instance, I have 32Gb RAM in my MBP, and the OS fills the unused space with cached files.)\nRight or wrong, these days, you have to buy the Mac with the RAM and storage that you need for its life; more is always better.\n", "Q: Is it possible to host my public apple calendar on my website? I have a public apple calendar that I'd like to make viewable (read-only) on my website so that visitors can see my schedule. I believe this can be done with a google calendar but I'm not having luck finding ways to do this with an apple calendar.\nEven if there isn't built-in functionality, I'd still be happy with janky ad-hoc solutions. For example, one thing which I half-considered before turning to stackexchange would be to see if an always-on computer could periodically scrape the calendar off my icloud account and somehow convert it to html and automatically update my website. I think that's a last-resort sort of approach though. (That said, if it's basically the only way this would work, I'm happy to hear suggestions on how to go about it, but I'd of course prefer if there's a more elegant or intentionally designed way.) At minimum, I'd like visitors to be able to see when I have appointments; location and event name would be nice but not strictly necessary.\n\nUpdate: I have attempted to incorporate @Riley4067440653's answer, but as I mentioned in a comment I do not think it works as a permanent solution. Edits made to the apple calendar are not passing to the google calendar in a timely manner; changes made to the apple calendar over 12 hours ago are still not appearing on the google calendar.\nMy understanding is that importing into the google calendar is a one-time process, and edits made to the apple calendar will never appear on the google calendar; I may be mistaken on that front, but regardless I do need edits to appear more promptly than 12+ hours later, so this solution doesn't work well for me.\nIf there is a way to automatically propagate changes made to the apple calendar onto the google calendar, then @Riley4067440653's solution will work for me. Again, perhaps this can be done ad-hoc -- if so I would appreciate some advice on how to deploy it -- but I'd prefer intentionally designed solutions if possible. If there is no way to automatically propagate changes, then I am still in need of a solution to this problem.\nAlso, to incorporate some comments with @nohillside into the body of this post:\n\n*\n\n*I am seeking a solution that does not require me to switch off of apple calendar (for which it was clarified that the app \"Fantastical\" does not, but it's not clear to me how that app solves my problem),\n\n*I want visitors to the website to see my schedule, not my availability,\n\n*I want the website calendar to be read-only; visitors are not using it to schedule my free time with me, and\n\n*I want the website calendar to be either directly on my website or embedded (in like an iframe); I do not want to give visitors a link to an external site or require them to use/download a program.\n\n\nA: I've never used it before, but Open Web Calendar seems like an option. Just set the calendar that you want to share to public in the Calendar app, take the URL that it generates, and paste that into the first text field on the Open Web Calendar page, changing webcal:// to https:// in the URL. (You can repeat this for as many calendars as you'd like, and they’ll all display in one view: just paste each calendar URL into a new text field on Open Web Calendar.)\nYou'll see a preview of the embeddable calendar automatically appear, and it'll give you code for an iframe that you can stick on a website. There are also customization options you can modify at the bottom of the page. And since it's pulling directly from the iCloud ICS feed, it'll update automatically when you add new events to the calendar.\nAdditionally, here's a link to the GitHub repo for Open Web Calendar.\n\nA: You can host an Apple calendar in a roundabout way by using Google calendar. There might be more efficient solutions however this one is straightforward enough.\n\n*\n\n*Create a public calendar (see 'Share a calendar', step 4 in Apple's guide). Copy the webcal:// url.\n\n\n*In Google calendar, import a calendar 'from url', and paste the copied url. (Steps are described in this guide). This Google calendar should sync with the Apple calendar.\n\n\n*You can embed the Google calendar on your website as per this Google support document.\n", "Q: Memory Usage: M1/M2 Macs, vs Intel Wondering if M1/2 Macs use memory more efficiently than Intel Macs?

My main memory hogs would be FotoMagico or iMovie, Photos to present slideshows or create home movies.\nDon't need to run many apps at once.\n\nA: 8 GB is not enough for serious use nowadays, I easily use 14 GB on my M1 mini by doing just simple stuff (and not closing any applications).

The strange thing about it is that I can't change my time zone. Also, the TouchID is deactivated so I have to keep entering the password. For example, I have to use the password for installing applications instead of TouchID.\nOnce I fixed these problems by reinstalling the operating system and it fixed for a while but again has these issues. The strange thing is that I don't see any error message from the operating system.\nDoes anyone know where the problem is and how I can fix it? If the problem is serious, does the App Store support it for free?\n\n\nA: Apple online support is free, so I would for sure get a case opened there. Second thing is to check if MDM profiles are managing this Mac (look for profiles in system preferences, if it’s not here, you have no MDM or profile).\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/allow-apps-to-detect-the-location-of-your-mac-mh35873/mac\n\n*https://support.apple.com/choose-country-region\nLastly, might you be in a region where location is not provided?\nThis particular issue seems to have cropped up in the past as well.\n\nA: This is most likely a problem with user prefs, AppleID settings, Location Services, etc-- for which reinstalling the OS will do nothing.\nI agree that turning off and on Location Services is your first option, and you need to fix whatever it is that causes TouchID not to work. You could try signing out and back into your AppleID.\nIt's certainly worth taking it to an Apple Store -- yes, it doesn't cost anything (unless it's a hardware issue, which seems unlikely here).\n\nA: According to Apple's support site:\n\nThe option to turn Set Automatically on or off may not be available with for all network providers or in all countries and regions. If the device has a Screen Time passcode or a corporate profile with device restrictions installed, then the option to turn Set Automatically on or off will be dimmed or greyed out.\n\nNot sure if any of these situations apply to you.\n\nA: To change your timezone manually\nUncheck the box near the top that says \"Set timezone automatically using current location.\"\nIf you would like it to be set automatically\nYou will need to turn on Location Services as mentioned. That setting is under Security & Privacy in System Preferences.\nYou should create a separate question for the TouchID issue.\n", "Q: I have an iBook G3 running Mac OS 9.2. I moved Finder and now it won't boot. How can I fix this? I'm unfamiliar with classic Mac OS, and I wanted to make Finder easier to reach, so I moved it to the desktop. I didn't realize that this would make Finder inaccessible to the system! Since then, my computer won't boot into Mac OS. Instead, it shows the Finder logo and a question mark, which makes sense considering.\nWhat's the best way to move finder back where it belongs so I can boot into Mac OS?\nI had the idea that I could try to boot to a Mac OS 9 install image and access my hard drive that way. I have a MacBook Pro from 2020 and a USB stick, but I don't have a CD burner. I haven't had any luck trying to boot from the live USB.\n\nA: What you did, just moving the Finder out of the System Folder can be reversed, if you have some bootable media you can boot the iBook from.\nIt has been a l o o o o o n g time since I had to do this but the CD/DVD that shipped with the system may boot you into a usable GUI that allows you to move the Finder back to its needful location inside the System Folder.\nFailing that you can use the installer on that media to reinstall (EG repair) the system on that drive, boot it normally and then discard, the now unnecessary, Finder file on the desktop.\nNote that there are a number of files that you should never move out of the system folder. And while there are other files you should not move, \"Finder\" and \"System\" are two at the top of that list.\n...now, if you ever need help installing memory in an SE/30... ;-)\n", "Q: How do I import my old downloaded podcasts into either Apple Music or Podcasts app (in Monterey)? Many years ago (like, pre-2017) I downloaded several dozen lectures (plain .mp3 files) and imported them all into iTunes.  Then I changed the \"Media Kind\" for all of those files to \"Podcast\", which had a number of useful features for me, chief among them:\n\n*\n\n*I could configure iTunes to sync only unplayed \"episodes\" to my iPod\n\n*My iPod would remember my playback position if I stopped in the middle (useful when listening to 90+ minute lectures!)\n\nWhen iTunes was split into separate Music and Podcasts apps, those files seem to have become inaccessible via either app.  To be clear:  I can still see the files, located in the same directory they always were (/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Podcasts).  But when running either the Music or Podcasts app in OS X 12.5 (Monterey), they are nowhere to be seen in those respective app's libraries.\n\n*\n\n*How do I get these files to show up in Podcasts? There doesn't seem to be a way to manually import already-downloaded files.\n\n*Failing that, how can I change the Media Kind back to \"Music\" and re-import them into the Music app?\n\n\nA: You are correct in your assumption that the new Podcast app doesn't support manual import, it's all about the management of external streams now.\nRegarding your own files, I think that the Media Kind of Podcast was purely in the old iTunes database as the relevant tag to dictate how the file was managed by iTunes. There is probably nothing specific in the internal ID3 tags of the MP3 files, but it wouldn't hurt to check and modify.\nI think you have two options:\n\n*\n\n*Manually move the files out of the old Podcasts folder to somewhere temporary, and then reimport to Music (ensuring the Preferences | Files | Copy Files... option is selected to make sure they are copied into the proper Music folder structure). Then enjoy the files as you would any music.\n\n\n*Again, manually copy the files to a temporary folder, and then look into turning the files into Audiobooks. They will then work in the Books app, both on Mac and iOS device (not sure about iPod, it would depend on its vintage). Being an Audiobook, it would support playback position continuity and chapters.\nThere are a few Audiobook apps in the App Store, most with a price tag, but one I used in the iTunes days is Audiobook Binder (Free), worth a try for a one-off. It will put together an .m4b file from a range of input. It shows its age by prompting you to point it at iTunes so it can import the book. This can be disabled in Preferences. Or if you forgot, it can be safely cancelled, and you can then open the .m4b in Books.\n\nA: From my own looking at this and experimentation (moved from Mojave to Monterey) I think reimport into Music.app is the best option.\nIf you use macOS Music.app column browse to see all with genre \"podcast\" you can select all then hit cmd-I. You'll see a prompt asking if you wish to multi-edit (yes). Then in Options select:\n'remember playback position'\n'skip when shuffling'\nThey will behave a bit more like old podcasts.\n", "Q: Are there apps to split one big screen into multiple spaces? I'm switching from three smaller screens to one big 42\" monitor with Rectangle to emulate multiple monitors. It works great and I enjoy the flexibility in arranging the windows.

In similar questions, the problem could be solved by emptying the ~/.zshrc contents.\nBut I get the problem even if the contents of the ~/.zshrc file are trivial.\n\nA: You don't need to specify .zshrc in Terminal Preferences.

I heard someone report that a $99 iPad app actually cost $120 as UK VAT was applied... I'm aware that UK/EU sellers would involve VAT but the company in question is based in the US.\nShould local taxes apply in this case, or only if they have an EU/UK subsidiary company?\nI don't recall ever paying additional taxes on an app purchase in the UK.\n\nA: Local taxes do and are applied as the purchaser is in the UK.\nYou should look at the invoice Apple gives for an App Store purchase.\nIt includes an item giving the VAT amount of 20% in the UK.\nand ends with\n\nCopyright © 2022 Apple Distribution International Ltd.\nAll rights reserved\nHollyhill Industrial Estate, Hollyhill, Cork, Ireland.

My previous laptop, a late 2013 MBP with Mojave, warned me at 5%.  Once upon a time I was told by a friend that is an electronic engineer to recharge a battery as late as possible (say 1% of charge remaining), but that was a long time ago, and said advice might not apply to modern (2022) batteries.  In any case, I used that advice (drain the battery as much as you can) for the old laptop, and it still managed about 1 hour of netflix streaming unplugged by the end of its life..\nSo, what is the best 'remaining charge' level to aim for before plugging in to maximise battery longevity?\n\nA: Strictly speaking the \"best\" remaining charge level to reach before plugging in to maximize battery longevity would be around 40%, and then charging it up to about 50% or 60%.\nThis isn't really practical however, and the actual benefits become less noticable the closer to 50% you keep your charge level.\nKeeping the charge level between 20% to 80% will significantly increase the number of useful charge cycles you get from a lithium battery.\n\nOnce upon a time I was told by a friend that is an electronic engineer to recharge a battery as late as possible (say 1% of charge remaining)\n\nThis would apply to nickel-cadmium chemistry batteries, which haven't  been used widely in laptops for a couple of decades.\nSide note: Apple often over reports charge levels by a few %. When you take your laptop off charge from full it will report as 100% for a few minutes so when you see 99% charge level reported that's likely to be closer to 96% actual charge.\n", "Q: Should most recently closed tabs be hidden at the top of the list? I've been trying to effectively use the list of recently closed tabs in Safari in iOS (15.5) for quite some time now, but I never seem to recognize any of my most recently closed tabs there. I've then scrolled to the very top (it's a long list) where I find my more recently closed tabs.\nThat's confusing — \"why are the recently closed tabs so inaccessible?\" — but I would've just written it off as a bug...except that every time I actually test the behavior the tab I just closed is placed first (at the bottom) of the list, so that it's no longer chronological. Now I'm even more confused than before the test!\nWeird. I then asked myself \"how do they eventually end up at the top of the list?\", so I relaunched Safari to let it reload from database and voila.\nIs this intended behavior? Does this happen to everyone or has Safari entered some weird buggy state for me?\n\nA: The list of recently closed tabs should start scrolled to the bottom because the most recently closed tabs should be at the bottom of the list. This allows you to quickly drag your finger from the button to the ‘first’ most recently closed tab to reopen it and then further back. Any other behaviour is a bug you should report to Apple.\n", "Q: Is there a way to copy data from your iphone internal storage to your mac? On a windows pc - a folder called iPhone -> Internal Storage is available to copy things from your iphone to your pc.\nI would like to do the same with my macbook.\nWhere is the iphone internal storage mounted so I can cp it to my mac?\n\nA: *\n\n*If it is just photos and videos from the Photos app, Airdrop would be a quick way to move some photos and videos from your iPhone to your Mac. Make sure Airdrop is enabled on your mac.\n\n\n*You could try an app called iFunbox to access some files on your iPhone. It is limited due to Apple's OS, but maybe it works for what you want to achieve.\n\n\n*If you use iCloud, you can enable the sync function. All photos and videos from your phone's photo app will be accessible in your Mac's Photos app. You can export them from there.\n", "Q: How to prevent contents of iCloud Drive from being accessible on on iPhone? Simply put, I want to stay signed in to Apple ID on my iPhone 8, but I don't want the contents of my iCloud Drive to be accessible on the phone. At the very least, I would like there to be an additional security barrier to access the iCloud Drive, something more than just having to enter my passcode to get past the lock screen.\nAt present, it seems like anyone who knows my phone's passcode can open the phone and go directly to Files, then tap \"iCloud Drive,\" and then have direct access to my entire iCloud Drive contents.\nThe issue is that one other person does have access to my phone's passcode, and I want to keep it that way, but I don't want that person to have access to my iCloud Drive. Touch ID doesn't seem to be available for blocking access.\nHave I missed something? Is there nothing I can do to keep my Drive more private? I don't want to stay signed out of Apple ID, that would be inconvenient and disadvantageous for multiple reasons.\nThanks to anyone who knows.\n\nA: The purpose of iCloud is to allow you to access all your files from any device signed-in with the same Apple ID.\nWhat you're asking for would go against the very purpose of iCloud and, therefore, isn't possible.\nOne option is to use a different service, like Dropbox or OneDrive, to store your files.  This allows you to add an additional level of security in order to access these files and it doesn't impact the functionality of iCloud.\nThe other option is to use iCloud Family Sharing and keep your iCloud Keychain and iCloud files private. Put your second iCloud account on this shared device and it will have different security keys and different files. It will still be locatable and managed and share purchases with your more private “owner” iCloud account.\n\nA: Well, in the meanwhile, I think I did find a solution to this particular issue with the iCloud Drive. My solution is simply to delete the Files app entirely, which appears to be the only app-based route to iCloud on the phone. Next, I have to put a one-minute limit on the App Store using the Screen Time function. I just have to open the App Store for at least a minute every day, and then after that it will be impossible to open the App Store without inputting my Screen Time code, not the passcode.  This will prevent the other person from re-downloading the Files app onto my phone.\nThis Screen Time function with a separate code, which can set a time limit for any app on the phone, is really the sort of barrier I was looking for -- but it's not ideal, because it cannot be set for 0 hours 0 minutes. One minute is the lowest it can set for. So, if I protect an app with this function, it's not really protected until I've used the app for at least one minute within the same day. Two minutes, actually, because Screen Time allows you to cheat just once, for an extra minute.  So, this is a step in the direction of what I wanted, but not that great.\nI simply don't see why it would be so hard for Apple to allow iPhones to have a secondary passcode, like the Screen Time code but without the limitations described above, with which the owner of the phone could lock any particular apps they chose. This would give the phone's owner complete flexibility and confidence with regard to sharing the phone with others.\n\nA: Apple allows you to manage your devices with MDM. This would be easiest if you disable the App Store or block it before you hand off the device. A free to get started hosted MDM is JAMF now.\n\n*\n\n*https://docs.jamf.com/jamf-now/documentation/Restrictions_for_Apple_Devices.html\nYou could start with blocking the files app or use the iCloud Documents block feature and then evaluate if you need to also block App Store app.\nThis would let you still use iCloud and other apps that sync via iCloud would still work and protect your segment of iCloud data by locking the door. If you needed to get at that data, use the MDM to remove the restriction and it will change over the air until you add the restriction back again over the air.\n\nThis is less effective than using a different Apple ID for iCloud on that device but if you don’t care about mixing and exposing personal health data, PassKey and iCloud Keychain being exposed on this device and just the files are of concern for your setup. MDM will help you block some of these as well, but I would encourage both the MDM so you can control your devices and possibly mitigate other issues as you discover then or your needs change over time.\n", "Q: Using terminal (ie, zsh), I want to run a certain shell command, every time, any file in a given folder is saved/added Hence, in a certain folder, say ~/Desktop/foo,\nany time a file/subfile/folder is touched (added, saved),\nI want to just run a certain command in the shell.\nIs there a way to do this, either with a zsh command, or perhaps some other automation on the Mac, or an app??

This enables AppleScript and Automator actions to be setup to monitor a specific folder and act on changes.\nThe simplest way to run a shell script, is to use Automator with a Run Shell Script action. On startup, Automator will ask the type, Folder Action is the one to choose.\nSome pointers:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/WatchFolders.html\nhttp://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/folder-action/index.html\nBe sure to checkout many other posts here on the subject also.\n\nA: You can do this using Folder Actions:\nCtrl-click any folder in the Finder and choose Services>Folder Actions Setup in Monterey.\nIn early versions of macOS, the option appears in the main lists of contextual items.\nTo avoid the malicious and accidental installation of Folder Actions, macOS requires a confirmation step that can’t be automated: click Run Service in the Confirm Service dialog.\nThis adds the current folder to the Folders with Actions list without adding actions.\nThe Folder Actions Setup window appears with a dialog already open that reads Choose a Script to Attach.\nThis list includes ones that Apple seeded, locating them inside the /Library/Scripts/Folder Actions Scripts folder. Any scripts installed by apps or that you’ve created and placed inside your Home directory’s ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Actions Scripts folder appear as well.\nYou can create Folder Actions in a numbers of ways:\n\n*\n\n*Use an item Apple provides in the dialog that appears when you invoke Folder Actions Setup. These mostly relate to image processing.\n\n\n*Create a Folder Action in Automator using its broader set of tools. This can include passing information to an AppleScript, JavaScript, or shell script.\n\n\n*Write your own AppleScript to perform a task.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of a Spotlight suggestion? You can see in the screenshot below a spotlight suggestion that I don't understand why it shows up, it looks like a Safari icon (as a web search result suggestion), but it actually is a bit different.\nI don't understand where it came from, what kind of suggestion it is (file, web search, email?) and most importantly how do I get rid of it?\nI know this has to do with Spotlight's \"Siri Suggestions\", as if I turn that off, it will go away. However, I do want Siri suggestions, I just want to get rid of this music band.\n\n\nA: It is a Siri Knowledge tidbit, making a search to the web (presumably Wikipedia) about a general artist. Similar to if you typed the name of a sports team, Spotlight would intelligently return current stats and upcoming games.\nIn this example, I searched for another small artist, PTAF, where you can see a thumbnail of the artist is not displayed because there's not one available from their Wikipedia. When you search a more popular artist, a thumbnail is displayed.\n\nIn your case, Siri seems to have that random tidbit of information about that band without an accompanying Wikipedia page... nice\n", "Q: Capture Zoom settings from AppleScript On a Zoom call, I'd like to use AppleScript to determine the currently active Microphone and Speaker.\nI can select a Mic option using https://github.com/raycast/script-commands/blob/master/commands/communication/zoom/toggle-mic.applescript but am unable to figure out how to read the values.\n\n\nA: you can use GUI scripting for this, e.g. this gets you the current speakers:\n    tell application \"System Preferences\"\n        reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.sound\"\n    end tell\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell application process \"System Preferences\"\n            tell tab group 1 of window \"Sound\"\n                click radio button \"Output\"\n                tell table 1 of scroll area 1\n            set selected_row to (first UI element whose selected is true)\n            set currentOutput to value of text field 1 of selected_row as text\n            display dialog currentOutput\n                end tell\n            end tell\n        end tell\n     end tell\n\n     if application \"System Preferences\" is running then\n        tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n     end if`\n\nGUI script elements might be located differently on different MacOS releases.\n", "Q: How do I change the Applications folder icon I know how to change the folder icon for any other folder by pasting the image into the info box of the folder, however this does not seem to work with the \"Applications\" folder.\nNo matter what I try I still end up with the default blue folder with the \"A\"\nI would like to use a different icon because I keep Applications in the dock and I just want something different.\nMacOS Monterey 12.5\n\nA: It's likely that you can't change it.

Recently, before I even log in to my iPhone running iOS 15.6, I receive Siri suggestions to call one of my calendar appointments, in addition to the reminder from the calendar appointment itself.  At present, I don't find the Siri suggestions to be well aligned with my needs, so they just cause cognitive noise.

I used to do this all the time with the following:\nopen smb://path/to/directory\n\nI just updated to Big Sur and now every time I do this, I get the following:\nThe file /Users/myusername/smb:/path/to/directory does not exist\n\nIs there some way to make it stop looking for the SMB path in the current directory?\n\nA: Check man open from your Terminal.app:\n% man open\n\nMine (Catalina) says:\n\nThe open command opens a file (or a directory or URL), just as if you had double-clicked the file's icon. If no application name is specified, the default application as determined via LaunchServices is used to open the specified files.\n\nAnd so it depends on the LaunchServices database - which maps/associates certain files and actions with their applications. For example, an Excel spreadsheet *.xslx is associated with the Excel application; a dbl-click on a *.xslx file will launch Excel, and open the file you dbl-clicked. So that's how it works in general. Unfortunately, its construction is not very well documented, and may be useless in this instance. But, FWIW, you can view its contents like so:\n% /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -dump> LaunchServicesDump.txt \n\n# open the output file in the pager `less`: \n\n% less LaunchServicesDump.txt \n\n# search or browse; I didn't find much useful here\n\nThe problem you seem to be having here is that the object of your open command: smb://path/to/directory may have had some meaning on your old system, but it has none on your new BigSur system.\nYou didn't explain, and so I will hazard a guess that there were other steps/commands used to enable this to work on your old machine. I think there are two solutions to your problem:\nSolution 1. Use Finder to first create a connection\nThis may be what you did on your old system. Try this:\nStep 1.\nOpen Finder, click the Go item in the Menu, and then Connect to server... (or ,⌘K)\nStep 2.\nEnter smb://path/to/directory, and click the Connect button - alternatively, click Browse to open a Finder window with all known network hosts & select one.\nStep 3.\nA Finder window will open showing all the files & folders from that network share. After you close that Finder window, that connection should now be registered in your LaunchServices database; i.e. you may type open smb://path/to/directory in Terminal.app, and Finder will open to that share.\nSolution 2. Use the CLI to mount the SMB server on a local folder\nStep 1.\nRead man mount and man mount_smbfs. mount_smbfs is referred to as a \"helper app\" for the mount command, and its man page will contain information on the options you'll need to use with mount.\nStep 2.\nTry to mount your SMB server from the CLI (Terminal.app) using something like this - adjusted for your server & network situation:\n% mount -t smbfs //userid:userpwd@SMBserverURL/sharename /Users/macuserid/local_folder_mntpoint\n\nWhere:\n\n*\n\n*userid - your user account name on the SMB server\n\n*userpwd - your user password on the SMB server\n\n*SMBserverURL - the IP address of your SMB server, or a recognized network name\n\n*sharename - the shared folder on your SMB server you wish to access\n\n*macuserid - your Mac username\n\n*local_folder_mntpoint - the directory/folder on your Mac's local drive to use as the mountpoint\nStep 3.\nOnce your mount command has succeeded, you should be able to open Finder to your mounted drive as follows:\nopen /Users/macuserid/local_folder_mntpoint\n\nor, if your mountpoint is in your $HOME folder:\n% cd        # go to $HOME folder\n% open local_folder_mntpoint\n\nAn Alternative:\nAn alternative to the manual mount as shown above is to set up an automount. That's probably best answered under another question.\n", "Q: Why am I getting \"go: undefined method `on_intel' for #\" when attempting to install direnv by Homebrew?

Just a v.\nI've looked at shortcuts in preferences and they are sound. tried resetting the SMC but that's not worked. What do I do?\n\nA: These are symptoms of a non-functioning Command key. Can you try using your right-most Command key as well to test with Command + space and Command + v? If it works with the right Command button, then that means your left Command key somehow has broken, indicating keyboard failure, not uncommon with Intel Macs from around 2016-2020 sad to say, when the infamous \"butterfly keyboard\" was being distributed on Macs in those years.\nBut if the right Command key doesn't work, then there's probably something fishy going on with some setting somewhere.

When I search for an app by name, Spotlight usually finds that app before it makes other suggestions. But when I was first setting up this new laptop, I mistakenly chose the web-search item for \"iterm\" (I use iTerm2 for my terminal), and so now every time I use Spotlight to open iTerm, it places the web search suggestion above the installed app.\nThis only happens for iTerm. If I search for the name of my graphics program, that app is the first suggestion, and the web search item appears below it. The same goes for my audio player, my browser, games, calculator, calendar, etc. But with iTerm, it's like I've ironed a wrinkle into the dress shirt and there's no way to smooth it out and iron it flat again. Now it has a permanent wrinkle that's as sharp and crisp as the crease in military slacks.\nI take this as proof that Spotlight has two data sources: (1) an index of disk contents, and (2) a remembered history of which results I tend to choose for particular search strings. All the \"reset Spotlight\" questions I've found on this site are concerned with resetting the disk index, and the remedies I've tried have had no impact on the bad ranking.\nI've disabled all Spotlight suggestions except Apps, Calculator, Conversions, and System Preferences. I've used mdutils from the CLI to nuke the Spotlight index. I've added my entire drive to the Privacy list and then removed it. I've tried repeatedly search for \"iterm\" and then carefully selecting the application, hoping to teach it to rank the app higher, and by now I'm quite sure that I've picked the app a hundred more times than the web search. I only wrongly picked the web search once. IT WAS ONE TIME.\nThe other factor that contributes to this problem is that MacOS has no way to remove search-the-web from the list of suggestions. Even if a person disables suggestions from the web (i.e. actual web search results), the OS still inserts into the Spotlight suggestions an offer to perform a web search for the Spotlight search string. If that could be removed, this problem would presumably go away, but lots of research suggests that the OS doesn't let us turn that off and never will.\nHow can I reset my Spotlight \"usage data\" to make it forget all my previous searches and which suggestions I selected each time?\n\nA: The \"Spotlight usage data\", as you call it is kept in the following file...\n~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.spotlight/com.apple.spotlight.Shortcuts.v3\n\nRemove it and log out and back in (before making another search) and check if that solves your issue.\nDepending on the operating system in use, the file could also be here in older ones: ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.spotlight.Shortcuts\n", "Q: How to backup multiple Macs with a single USB drive without attaching to network? I have multiple Macs backing up to a NAS. The NAS is backing up to an off site server. Problem is, the network Time Machine backups are unreliable (in my experience), often getting corrupted, and not finishing on laptops connected via WIFI. To work around these issues, I want to use a large, external USB drive that I connect to most important machines once per month or so to make a local backup. I want to share this USB drive across multiple machines vs buying a new USB drive for each machine.\nIn the past, I was able to just attached a USB drive and backup the Mac, then attach to the second Mac and backup to the same drive. Time Machine created a separate folder for each Mac I backed up.\nFor some reason, however, my new drive is not doing this. If I backup a Mac, then the next machine sees that as another machines backup and I have a choice to wipe (Start a New Back) or inherit that backup.\nI tried reformatting the drive as AFS and HFS. It doesn't matter as the result is always the same.\nIs there anyway to setup an external USB drive as a portal Time Machine backup drive for multiple Macs?\n\nA: Time Machine (pre macOS 11) used HFS+ formatted backup disks with a different folder for each backup. But with macOS 11 and 12, new backups use APFS formatted volumes - note a volume for each backup, not a folder. From what you say, I think you have got tangled up in that transition.\nFor the future, you can create multiple APFS volumes on your USB drive and tell Time Machine on each Mac to use its specific volume.\nAs an example of disk layout, I have created a disk image, first with one APFS volume and then added a second and third volume.  You can do the same thing with your USB drive, though it will require erasing (or re-partitioning) the drive to get started.\n\nOn each Mac, tell Time Machine to use its own volume. TM will reformat that volume for its use.\nAnd you can add further volumes as required for each Mac.

I'm new to OSX, so while clearing out multitude of icons that my Macbook Pro came with, I mistakingly removed Launchpad from the dock! After watching a few tutorials, I realize I actually need it for a lot of things. What's the fastest/easiest way to bring it back to the dock?\nEssentially what I'm asking is, where do the apps go when you remove them from the dock?\n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different.\nLaunchpad is an application itself. Apps don't go anywhere when you remove them from the Dock; the Dock is just shortcuts in graphics.\nOpen the Finder by pressing Option ⌥+Command ⌘+Space Bar ␣. After the Finder is launched, go to the Applications folder within Finder by pressing Command ⌘+Shift ⇧+ A. Find the Launchpad application in the Applications folder and hold and drag it down with your mouse to the position where you want it in the Dock. See this article called \"How to Add Launchpad to the Dock on a Mac\" for more details.\nIf you wish to start the Launchpad without using its icon in the dock even after you place it back, you can do that by pressing the Launchpad key (F4) on your keyboard.\n", "Q: Does Apple silicon hardware support USB tethering in macOS recovery mode? After updating my Intel MBP to macOS 12.5, I got locked out. When trying to reset the password in the recovery mode (power+cmd+r), USB tethering to my iPhone did not work and I had to use my iPhone as a hotspot through Wi-Fi. Then I was able to set a new password using my Apple ID.\nI am now wondering if Apple silicon MBPs can use USB tethering in the recovery mode.\n\nA: M1 Macs cannot use USB tethering to provide a network while in Recovery Mode. This is the same as your experience on an Intel Mac.\nThe recoveryOS UI only presents options for connecting to WiFi, or wired Ethernet networks (with the addition of a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adaptor for MacBooks). The USB tethering functionality is contained in the Network Preferences pane under a normal boot of macOS.

One of the devices turned out to still be on 12.3 (vs the other running 12.5). I had assumed that because no updates were presenting as pending that both machines were up to date, and on the same version.\nUpdating the 12.3 machine to 12.5 enabled the Share keyboard/mouse option.

And good luck dealing with the fallout if it was her only pic of her best friend etc.\nGet your daughter to start sorting her photos and having a folder / album of important aka \"must never delete\" photos so weekly or monthly housekeeping can be easier.\n\nA: I agree with Solar Mike that auto-delete, even if doable, is to be avoided. Here are a few things your daughter can do:\n\n*\n\n*As suggested, encourage her to periodically cull the \"not so good\" or \"very similar to the other\" photos. Videos take up a lot more space than photos, so just deleting a few videos will help (in iPhone Photos, select the Albums tab > Media Types > Videos)\n\n\n*If she has her own Apple ID (and therefore her own 5GB free quota of iCloud), go to iPhone Settings > Profile > iCloud > turn iCloud Photos ON and check mark 'Optimize iPhone storage'.\n\n\n*Go to iPhone Settings > Camera > Formats, and ensure that 'High Efficiency' is check marked.

(same script)\nUPDATE TWO: Even though the error messages are not there for most (not all) of the files and paths in bash, find says that none of the files are there, and only one of the bottom level directories!\nUPDATE 3: I discovered that the shell created a directory called \"~\" instead of expanding it.  I knew that $ variables were expanded inside double quotes, but didn't know that ~ isn't.  (I think that inconsistency was a bad design choice, but we're stuck with it now.)  Came here to mention it as a solution and I see that it is already in a comment.  Anyway, that's where my \"ghost files\" went.\n\nA: ~ is not expanded inside quotes.

The APFS partition is a Time Machine backup, and thus many operations on it are disabled by SIP or ACLs or xattr.\nMost of the files on the problem partition are still accessible.\nWhat is the best way to partition a new drive into two APFS volumes of approximately the same size and usage (one for Time Machine and one for interactive archiving)?\n\nA: From the Disk Utility Guide:\n\nApple File System (APFS) allocates disk space on demand. When a single APFS container (partition) has multiple volumes, the container’s free space is shared and can be allocated to any of the individual volumes as needed. Each volume uses only part of the overall container, so the available space is the total size of the container, minus the size of all volumes in the container.\n\nand:\n\nif you want to manually manage APFS volume allocation, click Size Options, enter values in the fields, then click OK\n\n\n*\n\n*Reserve Size: The optional reserve size ensures that the amount of storage remains available for this volume.\n\n*Quota Size: The optional quota size limits how much storage the volume can allocate.\n\nThis configuration works perfectly well when one volume of the container is reserved for Time Machine and the other(s) are used for other storage.\n", "Q: Chrome doesn't always add file extension to downloaded images When I download an image using Chrome or Chrome Canary, the saved file sometimes (not always) lacks an extension.\nFor example, I can reproduce it with this image: https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.urbansplatter.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F05%2FGolden-Gate-Bridge-Xlg.jpg&f=1&nofb=1\nBut not with this one: https://www.urbansplatter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Golden-Gate-Bridge-Xlg.jpg (this is the same image but not behind DuckDuckGo's proxy).\nI seem to always be able to reproduce it when saving images from DuckDuckGo.\nAt first I thought maybe the content-type response header isn't set in the DuckDuckGo response and that leaves Chrome wondering what the file extension might be. But that isn't true: both links have the same content-type (image/jpeg).\nTo make things even weirder: when I manually add a file extension of .png to the file, crop the image using Preview, and hit save, something is appended to the filename (e.g. 'Golden-Gate-Bridge-Xlg-1233898474.png' becomes 'Golden-Gate-Bridge-Xlg-1233898474.png.sb-701061cc-ssTk8o') and the cropped area is stored in a separate file (under 'Golden-Gate-Bridge-Xlg-1233898474.jpeg'). This does not happen when I use .jpeg as extension to begin with.\nSo my questions are:\n\n*\n\n*Why does my browser not always store images with an extension?\n\n*Why that weird behavior when cropping images? My current guess is: the file in question is 'really' a jpeg and the weird behavior is my OS coercing it back into a jpeg because I gave it a png extension. (But if it knows it's 'really' a jpeg, that brings us back to question 1.)\n\n\nA: The HTTP headers show no extension for the duckduckgo link:\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\n...\nContent-Disposition: inline; filename=\"Golden-Gate-Bridge-Xlg-1233898474\"; filename*=UTF-8''Golden-Gate-Bridge-Xlg-1233898474\n\nSo this may be a case of garbage in, garbage out.\nManually putting a .png extension onto the Golden-Gate-Bridge-Xlg-1233898474 file that is actually of type image/jpeg will complicate things even more.\n", "Q: iPhone 13 Pro randomly vibrates four times I have an iPhone 13 Pro running iOS 15.6, which I got in January.

Because there's no other sound I have no idea if it happens without the phone being in my pocket.\nI have tried holding the buttons in all possible combinations and none of them cause this specific vibration pattern to occur; the \"emergency/SOS\" vibration is the closest thing but its vibration pattern is totally different (being a couple of brief clicks), and is accompanied by other effects (such as FaceID shutting off and a bunch of UX for contacting emergency services popping up).\nIt's always exactly four pulses (bzzz bzzz bzzz bzzz), and it seems like the sort of thing that would be a specific diagnostic code from the phone.\nI have contacted Apple support about this and they have no idea.\nIt generally happens once or twice a day, at totally random times. The phone is always locked and when I unlock it, it goes straight to the application launcher/home screen. It seems unlikely to be a notification coming from an app, and I've disabled push notifications on pretty much every app anyway.\nDoes anyone have any idea what's going on?\n\nA: Check Settings > Sound & Haptics to see if there are any vibration-only haptics set.  One potential culprit is the New Mail haptic.\n", "Q: How can I get the iOS Files app present in the MacOS Finder's iPhone Files tab? When navigating to my iPhone from the MacOS Finder sidebar I only see various apps being displayed. I know I have many more files on my iPhone from files downloaded off Safari that I've placed in the \"On My iPhone\" storage. How can I see my On My iPhone/Documents folder from MacOS Finder?\n\n\n\nA: The only way around this that I have found is by downloading Google Chrome on my iPhone and manually moving the entire \"On My Phone\" folder into the newly created Chrome folder and then accessing them from that folder in the Files tab in Finder with my iPhone connected to my MacBook.\nIt is absolutely ridiculous that this is seemingly the easiest way to do this.\nIt is important to note that I wasn't able to copy files from this folder directly to an external hard drive, I had to first move them to my computer then to the external drive. So, rather than being able to natively access the local files on an iPhone from a Mac and save them to an external hard drive you have to move them to a 3rd party's folder in files, then copy, not move, them from the 3rd party folder in Finder to a local folder on your Mac.  Then finally move them from there to an external hard drive.\nNeedless to say that this is not a quick process if you have a large folder on your iPhone.\nI'm not sure if you are still looking for a workaround like this, but since I came across this while searching for a workaround myself, I wanted to share my experience for anybody who may also be looking for help.\nHopefully Apple realizes how silly it is to not allow people to access these files natively and resolve this in future updates, I would recommend anybody that comes across this issue to leave feedback on Apple’s Support Site\n", "Q: Excess power use alert? I often hear the fan on my redacted's MacBook Air running continuously, indicating high power usage. Unfortunately, they're hard of hearing, and only likely to hear that when wearing hearing aids. Is there any way to get an alert when power use is above particular levels for particular amounts of time?\n\nA: The fans spinning up indicates that the CPU is getting hot, and needs some help to stay within operating temperatures. That is all. It is part of the hardware design and does not require action on the part of the user.\nWhile there is obviously a correlation between power supplied and heat produced, the fans spinning up do not directly 'indicate high power usage'.\nIf your relative? is doing work, then it is entirely expected and normal for the fans to kick in, and there is no reason that they should do anything in response to that. Higher CPU usage and fan spinning will use the battery faster, so they may need to plug it in sooner.\nIf the fans are always running high, even under minimal workload, then there may be a hardware problem, like a defective sensor; or a software problem that can be fixed with an OS update or a third-party fan control app.\nHowever, using fan control software to force the fans to spin down when they need to cool the CPU will result in an overheating CPU and potential hardware damage.\nSome apps use surprisingly high levels of CPU for their tasks -- the Chrome browser uses significantly more than Safari or other browsers, for example.\n", "Q: Apple Mail Display Name versus Contacts Entries (several of them mentioning the same email address) How does Apple Mail decide which \"long name\" / \"full name\" to be displayed in the various panes for an email address that occurs in several entries in the scenario outlined below, possibly spreading across the included iCloud identities?\nI have, for good reasons, several entries in my Contacts list that share email addresses. (My intention is not to discuss, whether this is a good or bad idea. I just have them, and I need them this way.)\nMoreover, I use multiple iCloud identities in my Contacts address book. (Think of this as one primary/private identity and one identity that is used just for sharing among several users, which are not necessarily present on the same computer.) So, sharing email addresses among Contacts entries might even be across different iCloud identities. (This is possible and, I think, a very good possibility.)\n\nA: In order to give at least a partial answer to my own question, I did some (non-exhaustive) testing with the following setting:\nAccounts\nI use two iCloud accounts. A \"private\" one that is also the default account of the Contacts app. And a \"shared\" one.\nAddresses\nI use a \"test\" email address, which I associated with four different entries in my Contacts app.\n\n*\n\n*One entry in the private account, which I also marked as \"my card\".\nThe test address is one out of several email addresses.\n\n\n*Another entry in the private account.\nThe test address is one out of several email addresses.\n\n\n*An entry in the shared account.\nThe test address is the only address of this entry.\n\n\n*An entry in the shared account.\nThe test address is one out of several email addresses.\nIn order to easily recognise the effects in Apple Mail panes (message list and message preview), I use different names (prefix, first, last) for the three entries.\nApps\nI assume that both the Contacts and the Mail app make heavy use of caching. I tried to prevent misinterpretations due to caching effects by closing and reopening these apps after changes to the entries. (Some entry changes nevertheless seem to take almost immediate effect to long names that are displayed in Apple Mail, but that is maybe worth another story.) I also deleted the Previous Recipients List.\nExperiment\nI send from the test address (webmailer) in \"To\" at entry 1 (but not the test address), 2 (but not the test address), and 3, and with \"Cc\" to the same addresses.\nI mainly wanted to find out:\n\n*\n\n*Which of the four entries in Contacts is chosen for displaying the long name in the \"From\" field in the various panes of Apple Mail?\n\n*Are there differences between the long names displayed in the \"From\", \"To\", and \"Cc\" (fields).\n\nI observe the following behaviour on the Mail apps of both(!) macOS and iOS devices:\n\n*\n\n*The message list pane will (almost) always display the long name of entry 1 as the From address, while the message preview pane will always display the long name of entry 3 as the From address.\n\n\n*In the \"To\" and \"Cc\" lines, the message preview pane will always display the long name of entry 1 for 1, 2 for 2, and 3 for 3. This was expected.\n\n\n*The behaviour seems independent of the order of occurrence of the test address in the entries 1 and 2. (3 has it as its only address, so there is no variety on any order.)\n\n\n*Redoing the above experiment by adding in entry 4 (but not the test address) in \"To\" and Cc\"\", this was displayed with the long name of entry 3. This was not expected.\nConclusion\n\n*\n\n*Mail obviously uses different strategies to decide which name to display in the \"From\" field of message list and message preview.\n\n\n*More testing is required to reengineer the decision strategies for displayed long names, also concerning the \"To\" and \"Cc\" fields.\n", "Q: What's the best way to reinstall curl on MacOS? I'm on MacOS, my Little Snitch firewall detected modification of curl. This could be an update or something else, but I wanna be 100% sure and want to reinstall curl.\nWhat's the best way to do so on MacOS?\nI was thinking to remove curl completely and reinstall with homebrew. The problem is that homebrew downloads packages using curl. I'm imagining an attack when modified curl could serve malicious packages for brew to install.\nMaybe I'm overthinking, just wanna be 100% safe.\n\nA: curl is installed as part of macOS, and is found at /usr/bin/curl. Since Catalina, this location is on a read-only system volume, so cannot be modified.\nIf you have installed another curl using homebrew, and it's this version that you suspect is modified, then you might want to do a 'clean' reinstall of homebrew, as if you hadn't already got it.\n\"Little Snitch: providing you with data to worry about since 2003.\"\n", "Q: Cannot copy folder in \"Documents and Desktop\" folders linked with iCloud Drive I am using a MacBook Air (M1, 2020) with macOS Monterey Version 12.5 (21G72).

Anytime I use ssh to communicate with a git remote repository, I receive the following:\ndlopen /usr/local/lib/libykcs11.dylib failed: (null)\n\nFor clone operations the error seems innocuous and the clone completes. However, if the remote repository changes and I do a git fetch --all I receive the above message, but the fetch is not performed. If I access the remote repository via https all works.\nI see the above behavior regardless if I use the Xcode Developer Tools git (version 2.32.1 (Apple Git-133)) or a new version from Homebrew (version 2.37.1).\nI have uninstalled and reinstalled the Developer CLI Tools.

Will the reformatting automatically put the reformatted partition into the container with the TM  volume without interfering with the TM usability?  If not, is there a manual way to do it?\n\nA: Your HFS+ partition and the TM APFS partition+volume are separate partitions. So if you reformat the HFS+ partition as APFS it will change the partition to an APFS container with a single volume inside it. Thus you get two partitions, each formatted as an APFS container. There is no automatic putting both volumes inside one container.\nDepending on the layout of your disk, you may be able to delete the HFS+ partition (after copying the contents somewhere else) and expand the existing APFS partition/container to fill the whole disk. If so, you can then add a second volume to the APFS container. You will then have a single APFS partition/container with two volumes - the TM volume (unchanged) and an empty new volume.\nBut you may need to erase the whole disk and start again with a new APFS container with two new volumes (one for TM and one for data). That will mean starting again with your TM backup.\nAdding the output for diskutil list to your question would help.\nEdit:\nI following your links back to this question ghost files—now you see 'em, now you don't? From this I can see that your corrupt HFS+ partition is first on the drive.  In which case, deleting the HFS+ partition will leave an empty space and, though I have not done it recently, Disk Utility has never allowed me to move an APFS partition to the start of the disk which would have allowed you to expand it.\nSo I believe your choices are to:\n\n*\n\n*Erase everything and start again (which I know you don't want to do) creating a single APFS partition, or\n\n*Create a 3TB APFS partition to replace the deleted HFS+ partition.\n\nThe latter will leave you with 2 APFS partitions/containers (3TB and 5TB) with the 5TB container having the one TM volume.  You can add volumes as you wish to each container.\n", "Q: M1 Air not seeing Big Sur installers in boot picker I have an M1 Air, and I wanted to downgrade it to Big Sur (more specifically, 11.2.3). So I created a USB installer, tested it with my Intel machines, and they were able to boot into the installer USB just fine. When I plugged in said USB (just a regular USB-A flash drive with an adapter), it just wouldn't be acknowledged at all in the boot picker. Disk Utility does see it just fine, even saying that it's bootable, but none of the actual boot pickers see it (Startup Disk, holding down power, etc).\nI thought this was an adapter issue, since they were pretty cheap, so I pulled out my USB-C flash drive, made that into an installer just like last time with the .app and the createinstallmedia command... it works on the Intel machines again but it's the same thing with the M1. I even went as far as to nuke the Monterey install on the SSD in hopes that it'd have no other choice and have to boot into my installers... hahahaha, no, instead now I have only the Monterey recovery partition. Seemingly went through the whole internet for answers to find nothing at all.\nIt definitely can't be Apple preventing downgrades, right? After all, I've seen other people on Monterey downgrade to Big Sur just fine on their M1 machines... I heard about using .ipsws and Apple Configurator 2 but I don't have another Mac with a TB3 port nor a TB3 to TB3 cable. Can't be that it needs a specific M1 version of Big Sur since it's quite literally a .app...\nI'm out of ideas, I gave up and am currently reinstalling Monterey, but any help to finally solve this weird mystery of mine is very well received! Apologies if anything's confusing, please do ask if that's the case since I'm writing this at 1AM still trying to figure out what's going on... Thanks in advance!\n\nA: There is no way to downgrade to Big Sur 11.0.x, 11.1.x, 11.2.x using standard approach as you did using the application installer. You have to use IPSW method to downgrade to these specific versions.\nHowever, from Big Sur 11.3 and above this issue has been resolved, so if you don't mind using 11.3 you can install it via the standard approach and disk will be visible in boot picker and will boot.\n", "Q: rsync listing directory with no changes I have been trying to figure out this rsync behavior, where it still lists directories with different timestamps and the same sizes despite providing a --size-only flag.\n# lists some directory without listing any changed files\n> rsync -av [path 1] [path 2] --dry-run --size-only\n> building file list ... done\n> folder1/folder1a/\n> folder1/folder1b/\n\n# checks reasons with -i\n# ...\n> .d..t....folder1/folder1a/\n> .d..t....folder1/folder1b/\n\nAs you can see, --itemize-change shows that the only difference between the source and destination folders is the timestamp. But it is still listed in my regular rsync run despite providing --size-only. Is there a way to fix this? It seems like it still modifies the destination folder if I were to run it, which causes a folder reupload in my cloud backup services. Thanks!\nEDIT: rsync version is 2.6.9. Source is a folder with subfolders inside it, and inside which are random files. Destination is my OneDrive folder. It should be identical to the source, but after running rsync to transfer the folders, it seems like OneDrive touches the folders and making future rsync see them as different (and nothing else manual is happening when rsync is being run). I don't mind that, but I just don't want rsync to update them further when run in the future. Hence I add the --size-only flag to ignore timestamp differences. What I am trying to understand is why these dir's are still being listed, even though the change reported by --itemize-change is only timestamp difference (.d..t....)? I just don't want them to be re-transferred every time I run rsync simply because they have different timestamps.\nEDIT 2: At first I uploaded them onto OneDrive (not w/ rsync), then ran rsync with --size-only on the folder later. As a result the mod time of the destination files are never changed. While --size-only skips over the file themselves, the folder is still seen as \"different\". So I think that even though the only difference on the folders itself is timestamp (.d..t....), it still updates the folder as the files inside are perceived to be different (even with --size-only). Once I rsync'd everything without --size-only one time, the problem disappeared since the mod time of files inside have changed.\nBut this behavior is undesirable, since the folder and the files themselves are identical aside from timestamps, so --size-only should ignore the folder altogether. I am only intending to use rsync to fill missed files after uploading onto OneDrive (web), and not rsync them from the get-go (as sometimes syncing changes from local drive with OneDrive is very very slow compared to uploading). Is there a way around this? How can I stop rsync from updating directories whose contents are identical size-wise?\n\nA: The rsync command you're using: rsync -av ...\nIf you refer to man rsync, note the following:\n\n-a, --archive               archive mode; same as -rlptgoD (no -H)\n\nIn other words: -a implies the options: -rlptgoD\nNote that option -t is defined in man rsync as follows:\n\n-t, --times                 preserve time\n\nNow, for the --size-only option, man rsync tells us:\n\n--size-only\nNormally rsync will not transfer any files that are already the same size and  have  the  same  modification time-stamp.  With  the --size-only option, files will not be transferred if they have the same size, regard-less of timestamp. This is useful when starting to use rsync after using another mirroring system which may not preserve timestamps exactly.\n\nI have not had time to verify this (I'll let you do that if you don't mind), but what I think this means is that while no file is being transferred (it's a folder) due to --size-only, the -t option (implied with -a) is causing the folder's time stamp (modification time) is being updated by rsync. You can verify that by changing the rsync command you're using to:\nrsync -rlpgoDv --dry-run --size-only [path 1] [path 2] --dry-run --size-only\n\nNote there are two (2) changes here; one to eliminate the (implied) -t option, the other to place all options prior to the Source & Destination locations to correspond with the command syntax under SYNOPSIS in man rsync. Also, I seem to vaguely recall reading somewhere that misplacing options in rsync created issues.\nTo reiterate some of the comments:\n\n*\n\n*See the table at the bottom of the GitHub recipe to help decode the -i output.\n\n\n*The recipe also contains a procedure & script you may consider using to verify you are getting exactly what you want; the get-stats.sh script - or simply using the stat command selectively - will allow you to verify the time-stamps.\n\n\n*If you're using ver 2.6.9 of rsync, you should probably invest some time to upgrade to a current version. I recommend MacPorts for this. If you have any detailed questions on how to go about that, those are probably best handled under a new question.\n", "Q: Issue accessing Startup Security Utility on brand new Macbook Pro M1 I'm trying to follow this guide to install a driver for my audio interface on a brand new Macbook Pro M1 16\".\nI'm booting into recovery mode, but when I click into \"Utilities\", I'm prompted with the message \"There are no users on this volume to recover\" and two options to Restart.\nThe Macbook works perfectly well in all other areas when booted normally.

(6 Studios, 4 Minis.) I've got several of those new Studio's to provision.\nWith our fleet of 2013 Trashcans, having a master image worked great. It'd be extremely tedious and impractical to configure each system. We also have rental customers, so wiping and re-imaging after a rental wraps is safe and effective.\nOur procedure used to be:\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the master image's SSD\n\n*Wipe and clone it into the boot drive (we liked SuperDuper)\n\nWith few tweaks, this has worked great. But with the M1 and T2 security models, imaging has become so unreliable it's impractical. A few of the problems:\n\n*\n\n*First boot from the SSD takes a long time, the Mac is running some kind of mystery update for 7 minutes. (Maybe 12.5 causes LLB to update system-paired firmware?)\n\n*Then (sometimes) the Mac has to \"phone home\" for a few more minutes to reactivate.\n\n*Most crucially though, the clone (usually) breaks the administrator account. So when we go to RecoveryOS to update the Security Policy (our main SAN needs kexts to load), we get a \"No administrator was found\" error. (Both the clone source and target have admin accounts, Secure Token is enabled for them, and they're the same account name and password. updatePreboot didn't help either.)\n\nSo then we're off to SC2/DFU, internet recovery, rm .AppleSetupDone to make a 2nd admin account w/ Setup Assistant, etc… and by then the whole process is not worth the effort.\nTL;DR  I know that ultimately, the proper solution will be to enroll in Apple Business Manager and deploy MDM in our company. It's in the works.\nBut until then, what's the best solution to all this? I'm open to tackling the specific technical hurdles I brought up, or other methods to sidestep them.\n\nA: Considering the total lack of answers, here are the best 3 answers I've found:\n\n*\n\n*Use the clone utilities, and boot to the freshly cloned target (new Mac's boot disk) from System Preferences > Startup Disk. This brings up dialogues warning that the disk has no authorized admin user(s), and allows fixing it, which registers them onto the firmware.\n\n\n*Use Migration Assistant as a clone restore utility. Contrary to what I read, it seems to work alright even if you re-run it on a deployed system (and not only in its initial run on a \"virgin\" deployment).\n\n\n*Establish MDM in your organization.\nOnce you add the steps to reduce the 1TR Security Policy and reapprove kexts, #1 and #2 still require about 13 steps to complete…\nBasically, I'd love to hear of a better way to do it. Until then, this is the best answer.\n", "Q: Removing launchdaemons in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons I am trying to disable and remove some plist files.

Isn't there any other way to turn off the screen, without using external hardware like a cover and not using Assistive Touch?\n\n*\n\n*Turn off button in the Control Centre: Android allows third-party apps to add custom actions to the quick settings. Is something like that not allowed in iOS? That is, there is no way to add a turn off button in the Control Centre?\n\n\n*Turn off using the physical home button: It seems long press is for Siri, but I do not use Siri. Can't I assign long press to turn off the screen? How about double click to turn off the screen? It seems that I could set an action for a triple click, but turning off the screen was not available.\n\n\n*Any app to turn off the screen?: On Android, there is an API to lock the screen or turn off the screen without locking (on newer Android versions), so there are apps that add widgets to turn off the screen. There is no such API on iOS, so a third-party app solution is not possible at all?\n\n\n*Any inbuilt gesture to turn off the screen? I don't know, something like 5-finger tap or 5-finger swipe down, etc.\n\nA: Assistive touch is the way to do this.\nIt is the only way, because it's the feature that was designed to meet this need.\nYou can toggle assistive touch with the triple click, if you want an easy way to hide/show the menu.\n", "Q: Running apple script trough launchctl not working BigSur I would like to run a short testing script in the background via launchctl that sends a notification every 10 seconds.\nWhat I did so far:\nI created a plist file named test.plist located in /Library/LaunchAgents/ containing the following lines:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>test</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/usr/bin/osascript</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>osascript</string>\n        <string>~/Desktop/test.scpt</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe command plutil /Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist  returns OK\nThe file test.scpt is an apple script located on the Desktop containing:\nrepeat\n    display notification \"HELLO WORLD\" with title \"TITLE\"\n    delay 10\nend repeat\n\nWhat I tried is the following:\n\n*\n\n*first I run sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist\n\n*after that launchctl enable gui/501/test\n\n*then launchctl bootstrap gui/501 /Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist\n\n*followed by launchctl kickstart -k gui/501/test\n\n*finally launchctl start gui/501/test\nUntil that moment I get no errors but nothing is happening (no notification)!\nWhen checking launchctl list I obtain -    1   test for my process!\nI tested this procedure placing my file in Library/LaunchAgents, ~/Library/LaunchAgents and Library/LaunchDeamons.

I bought a 2019 MacBook Pro that arrived with Catalina installed.  I want to create installers for older versions, but I don't know how far back I can go.  Since it takes a long time to download (and you can only download one at a time), I wanted to format the space for them while they are downloading.  Thus the question, What's the oldest MacOS I can put on a 2019 MacBook Pro?\nRe, long time to download: Monterey took a full hour after asking \"are you sure?\"  Big Sur didn't ask and took a few minutes.  Catalina asked, and then complained there wasn't room for it (needs 12.75GB).\n\nA: If it is a MacBook Pro 16\" 2019, it can run 10.15.1 (or later).\nIf it is a MacBook Pro 15\" 2019 or either of the 13\" 2019, it can run 10.14.5 (or later).\nFor this information, I use MacTracker (from the App Store) which has much the same data as EveryMac.\nJust clear a common source of confusion, no Mac can run a version of macOS dating from before that model of Mac was first released. To put it another way, macOS does not know about future Macs and doesn't have the drivers, etc. to support them.\nIf you do need/want to run macOS from before Mojave/Catalina, you should use a virtual machine. With VMware Fusion you could run macOS back to 10.6 (Snow Leopard), though you will find that older versions are no longer supported (but do work) by VMware Fusion and some (e.g. 10.6) will require hacks.  But that is a different question.\nIf it is a time bottleneck, you can download more than one at once by using the Apple direct download links which are list here by Mr. Macintosh.\n", "Q: About MainStage So I have an iMac and I've been using garage-band for recording and although I downloaded the full amount of sounds from the sound library, I still needed a cello sound which I could not find. Also, my keyboard lacks one too. I am also looking for a good 'strings' sound. I found out about MainStage and found the sounds could be compatible with garage-band. My question is, does MainStage have a good cello sound instrument? And good 'strings' sound as well? Aside from that, does it also have good electronic sounds? Thank you so much.\n\nA: The purchase of MainStage gives you access to the same sample libraries as are found in Logic, which are a superset of those in Garageband.\nThere is a cello in Garageband (or at least, it's shown in MainStage and Logic under a \"Garageband\" sample heading). It comes with several articulations: pizzicato, up and down bows, tremolo, trills and legato.\nIt is a single player, rather than a 'section' of several players.\nThere are other string samples in Garageband, like \"Full Strings\", \"Strings\", and \"String Ensemble\".\nIt has to be said that the quality of most of the orchestral samples in Garageband/Logic is not great: they were originally created at least 10 years ago when samples had to work on much less powerful CPUs and were consequently small and simple.\nThere are many third-party sample libraries that include strings (these may require the use of a VST/AU plug-in such as Kontakt). Prices can vary wildly and some are hundreds of dollars. Whether they are suitable for your needs is entirely subjective.\n'Electronic sounds' covers a wide range: Garageband comes with five synths: the ARP 2600, the Minimoog, the Waldorf Wave, the Nord Lead 1 and the Yamaha DX7, all of which can programmed.\n", "Q: Creating APFS external USB thumb drive with macOS 10.12.6 Sierra Trying to create an external USB thumb drive to run macOS Monterey from but first needs to be APFS, using macOS 10.12.6 Sierra; I don't have an option from Disk Utility to format with APFS. I followed instructions using this code:\ndiskutil apfs createContainer /dev/nameofmydisk\nbut I got an error:\ndiskutil: did not recognize APFS verb \"createContainer\"; type \"diskutil apfs\" for a list\nI did type list and got:\nUsage:  diskutil [quiet] ap[fs] <verb> <options>\n        where <verb> is as follows:\n     list               (Show status of all current APFS Containers)\n     deleteContainer    (Delete an APFS Container and reformat old disks to HFS)\n     deleteVolume       (Remove an APFS Volume from its APFS Container)\n     unlockVolume       (Unlock an encrypted APFS Volume which is locked)\ndiskutil apfs <verb> with no options will provide help on that verb\n\nI am not sure what to do from then on and what this all means.\nBasically, I do not want to update my OS on my computer, I want to run Monterey from an external drive USB thumb since it'd be easier to transport, and basically, because this is what I have at the moment because I don't actually care about having a new version of OS except for the fact that there are some tasks I can't perform on my Mac because of the OS is too old, and those tasks are not as relevant to me as it is to preserver my current system as it is.\nAs an example, I can't connect/transfer files to my new iPhone 13 through the Mac because the iPhone 13 requires to have at least a specific version of iTunes that I can't install on Sierra and a few other ones.\nMy machine is a MacBook Pro 2016 15\".\n\nA: I understand this is not what @julianlede is wanting. I will seek a bit more clarification before redoing this answer.\nAPFS in Sierra was pre-release, not to be used except for experiments and tests.

Perhaps connect it properly as a mouse? Thank you so much for your help.\nEDIT:\nI will add that I had an old mouse with this same computer that did work effectively.

It is not common but can happen even to brand new macs.\nThe first thing to do is to try a safe boot. Then get out a flashlight and see carefully if the Apple menu or system is running and just the back light has failed.\nApple has a very nice set of instructions for when your machine fails to boot. Be sure to do all the steps in order. You will save a trip to a repair shop by being careful to perform the easy fixes first.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204156\nA safe boot is in the steps, so you don’t have to do that first if you’re going to follow the KB / FAQ on triage for this.\nIf your Mac won’t start and you have another Mac, place the iMac in target disk mode and check if you can repair the drive using First Aid in Disk Utility and possibly look at the system logs. You should be able to tell the last time it ran successfully looking at the date of /private/var/log/system.log and opening it in the console app from your MacBook or other working Mac.\nOdds are you will need to back things up and then maybe attempt reinstalling the OS on top of the old iMac OS to make sure there’s no option other than a repair.\n", "Q: Safari Autofill \"Other Forms\" is not working I complete forms on a particular website regularly. I used to be prompted (I cannot remember when this stopped, but it was after updating Safari - now 15.6) with previous entries in each field via a dropdown box (these were not generated by the site).\nFor eg. If in a particular field I'd previously (on different occasions) entered: 1234, 1235, 1236 & 1237 then as soon as I started typing 1 in that field a dropdown box would open with all these as suggestions to choose from. This would include complete sentences.\nThis no longer occurs.\nI've spent much time searching for solutions after trying the obvious: turning off autofill/other forms, restarting Safari and turning it back on again to no avail.\nI cannot even find out where the list of forms that have saved autofill data is kept (so I can delete it in the hope that it gets reinstated)...?\nIs there a way to force information entered on a web page form to be saved?\nIf anyone can help me, it will save me an incredible amount of time over the rest of my life?\n\nA: Other Forms data is generated by you once you enable this feature in Safari.\nThe data store is encrypted and hidden in your user library, so you can do a few things.\n\n*\n\n*Delete it and then start entering data in this web site and others to recreate the data.\n\n*Try to decrypt a copy of this file so you can re-enter the previous data again by hand, sequentially in safari while browsing the appropriate web sites.\n\n*Contact the operator of that website if your browser no longer inputs data there the same way as the past.\n\nThe third item is most often the reason, the developers changed the code that makes the field and now safari doesn’t classify it the same manner as before. Not that the safari function has changed or broken.\nIf you can’t get this to work from many sites - possibly an Apple support call would be productive. The first thing Apple should suggest is to make a new user account to be sure your database and preferences didn’t get out of sync by intention or by error.\n", "Q: Move video forward/backward in Quick Time Player PiP mode I am loving Quick Time Player.

Is this customisation possible?\n\nA: You can create a Smart Folder (essentially a Spotlight search) that contains the files with the names you want, wherever they are located. You can then select them all in one go, and set the \"Open With...\" app in Get Info.\nIf you use Command Alt I, that will give you one Get Info window for all selected files.\nSo, in short: there's no automatic way to 'teach' macOS.\n", "Q: How can the availability of SetFile and GetFileInfo be detected without causing user interaction? Where are Commandline Developer Tools installed? In bash, to detect whether a command COMMAND is available, the following statement shall be executed.  (Note that I configured bash to be the default shell, instead of zsh.)\ntype COMMAND...\n\nFor example, type detects that the command cp is available and that the command foo is unavailable.\n$ type cp\ncp is /bin/cp\n\n$ type foo\n-bash: type: foo: not found\n\nNote that you can pass two or more commands to type.\n$ type cp foo\ncp is /bin/cp\n-bash: type: foo: not found\n\nHowever, type is useless to detect the genuine availability of commands SetFile and GetFileInfo, that is, to detect whether SetFile and GetFileInfo are truly usable.\nSetFile and GetFileInfo belong to Commandline Developer Tools for Xcode.  macOS 12 Monterey does not automatically come with Xcode nor Commandline Developer Tools.  Hence, SetFile and GetFileInfo are supposed to be unavailable if neither Xcode nor Commandline Developer Tools is installed.  Thus, I expected type SetFile GetFileInfo to deny their availability.  On the contrary, type affirmed their availability.\n$ type SetFile GetFileInfo\nSetFile is /usr/bin/SetFile\nGetFileInfo is /usr/bin/GetFileInfo\n\nThen, I executed SetFile and GetFileInfo in Terminal.

On one occasion, I clicked the \"Install\" button to let the Commandline Developer Tools (CLDT) be installed.  I thought that the Commandline Developer Tools (CLDT) would be installed into \"/Applications/Xcode.app\".  However, the installation of CLDT neither created the directory \"/Applications/Xcode.app\" nor installed CLDT into it.  Where was CLDT installed to?\nComparing before and after the installation of CLDT, has the binary file \"/usr/bin/SetFile\" changed?\nI speculated that \"/usr/bin/SetFile\" depended on a library or framework from CLDT.  If this is the case, where is the CLDT library or framework?\n\nA: If you want to know if the CLT is installed, one method is to look for the receipt with pkgutil:\n$ pkgutil --pkg-info=com.apple.pkg.{CLTools_Executables,CLTools_Base,DeveloperToolsCLI,DeveloperToolsCLILeo} 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^version: //p'\n\nWhich will return either null, or the version that is installed, as shown here.\n$ pkgutil --pkg-info=com.apple.pkg.{CLTools_Executables,CLTools_Base,DeveloperToolsCLI,DeveloperToolsCLILeo} 2>/dev/null | sed -n 's/^version: //p'\n13.4.0.0.1.1651278267\n$ \n\nIf you want to know the path to which the CLT is installed, use xcode-select(1).\n$ xcode-select -p      \n/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\n\n", "Q: Add a drop shadow to the clipboard image, for example when capturing a screenshot? I often want to add a drop shadow to images in my clipboard (like when using ⌃ ⇧ ⌘ + 4). For the macOS built-in capture utility I can add a dropshadow when capturing the whole window by hitting the spacebar.\n\nHowever, if I use the cross-hairs to make a smaller selection, then I don't get the dropshadow.\n\nThe dropshadow is really useful for me because it sets off the edge of the screenshot, making it stand out against the white backgrounds where I'm usually pasting it. So far I've been resolving this manually by pasting the screenshot into my image editor and manually adding the dropshadow, but I'm lazy and I'm tired of doing this manually.\nHow can I automatically add a dropshadow to the image in the clipboard?\n\nA: So far I've found the following to be the most painless and automatic approach (although it does require a few minutes of initial setup):\n\n*\n\n*Write an Automator Service that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Saves the clipboard to file\n\n*Uses ImageMagick to add the drop shadow\n\n*Copy the new image back to the clipboard\n\n\n\n*Create a new keyboard shortcut that calls said ^ Automator Service\n\nSo here's how to set it up step-by-step.\nPrerequisites\nbrew dependencies\nInstall pngpaste, which can save the clipboard to file, and ImageMagick (convert) for adding the dropshadow.\nbrew install pngpaste imagemagick\n\nManual impbcopy compilation\nimpbcopy is an informal tool that can copy an image file to the clipboard.

Select Workflow receives no input.\n\nPaste in these contents, making sure to set the path to wherever you installed impbcopy (I personally put it in ~/bin):\n/opt/homebrew/bin/pngpaste /tmp/to-add-dropshadow.png\n/opt/homebrew/bin/convert /tmp/to-add-dropshadow.png \\( +clone -background transparent -shadow 30x15+10+10 \\) +swap -background transparent -layers merge +repage /tmp/has-drop-shadow.png 2>/dev/null\n/PATH/WHERE/YOU/INSTALLED/impbcopy /tmp/has-drop-shadow.png\n\n\n\n*(Optional) Tweak 30x15+10+10 to modify the dropshadow's size and transparency. The format is opacity x blur_strength + horizontal_distance + vertical_distance (documented here).\n\n\n*Save the shortcut as \"Add Dropshadow To Clipboard Image\"\n\n\n*Finally, assign it a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > General > Add Dropshadow To Clipboard Image.

The issue is: I cannot even power it down properly.\n\n*\n\n*Can I still retry log in (typing in the password)\n\n*Or, somehow shut it down gracefully\n\nIt doesn't show any log in input fields any more, and there is no Shut Down icon. Only a Cancel button which will cause the computer to nap right away.\nThe details are:\nThis happens ONLY when I left the MacBook Pro there, and it ran out of power and therefore hibernated, and then I charge it up to 100% and try to log in. In such case it seems it cannot recognize my password.  See the P.S. below about other people having similar issues.\nI might have missed one character or two (capitial letter, symbol, etc) and after a perhaps 8 or 10 times, it now says, \"Your Account is locked\" on the log in screen.\nThere is only a \"Cancel\" button to put the computer to nap right away.\nSo I cannot log in, try again, or gracefully shut down the computer.\nI do not want to press the power button for 10 seconds or press the Shift-Ctrl-Opt-CMD Power button to force it to power down, as that would hurt the OS and the hard drive.

Even if the OS is running, the chance of damage is very small when the screen is locked, so power down the Mac. Find another computer to read the process, make a beverage and snack and be careful if you’re already at 7 failed attempts (15 minute delay territory).\nAfter 3 to 5 failed attempts I recommend people stop and use another unlock method. Apple has a very clear process for you (and others who will surely get locked out at some point) in this next link on how to reset the password.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202860\n\nIf the 10 attempts are exhausted, 10 more attempts are available after booting into recoveryOS. And if those are also exhausted, then\n10 additional attempts are available for each FileVault recovery mechanism (iCloud recovery, FileVault recovery key, and institutional key), for a maximum of 30 additional attempts. After those additional attempts are exhausted, the Secure Enclave no longer processes any requests to decrypt the volume or verify the password, and the data on the drive becomes unrecoverable.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/security/passcodes-and-passwords-sec20230a10d/web\nIf you have a backup, erase the Mac and restore from backup if you can’t get it unlocked with help from us or Apple support or the first link above.\n\nA: It turned out that it may be better to use my iCloud account to reset my password.\nBy the way, I am not sure if there was any loophole on the Mac with Monterey and some hacker changed my password, because I was quite sure about the possible password combinations and I tried them all, and it still could not log me in. That actually happened to both my MacBook Pro 16 M1 and my MacBook Pro 14 M1.\nSo follow this link: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212190\nand it will guide you to reset your Mac password using your iCloud password.\n(Basically, if it is Intel Mac, restart the Mac, and press and hold CMD-r to go into recovery mode, or if M1 Mac, then start up the Mac, and press and hold the power button. Once you are in Recovery mode, open Terminal and run resetpassword.)\n", "Q: Is it safe to use 4-digit PIN as MacOS password like in Windows 10? On Windows 10 desktop I can set 4-digit pin to log in (after I've logged in with Microsoft Account) and it's relatively safe. So it's quick to type in the PIN throughout the work day.\nI wonder if it's just as secure to set a 4-digit pin on macOS?\n\nA: No it is not as secure. This is because the PIN (password on macOS) is entered at startup/login and without any further passwords gives access to iCloud and potentially multiple other cloud services, as well as everything on the Mac including all your email messages.\nThe only thing still protected would be managing your iCloud account which will require your iCloud password. Any passwords (e.g. those to web sites) you (or Safari) have stored in your Keychain are fully usable.\nYou must follow your own risk assessment, but if it were me I would not even consider what you are suggesting.\n\nA: No way is a 4 digit password secure for a computer log in.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-bw/guide/mac-help/flvlt003/mac\nIt violates the first recommendation to Choose a password with eight characters or more and a mix of different character types\nOnce you’ve chosen a secure password for sign in, review the other passwords you may need to consider securing and how they relate on macOS.\nFor quick access, perhaps a physical token or Apple hardware with biometric assistance will let you secure your Mac and unlock quickly?\n\n*\n\n*https://www.yubico.com/products/\n", "Q: suspicious hidden files Here are some odd hidden files in my home directory:\nwine is no surprise; I have used it in the past, and the date is old.\nyoutube-dl: maybe I used it on that date.\nfontconfig: don't think so\nBut .android three days ago?

What would .android be for if we don't use Android?  (No Google apps here either)\n\nA: You can delete anything in your user account, and any software that was using that data will just behave as it would for a brand new user account.\nAnd of course you have a backup to restore the files in case anything goes wrong.\nSo delete away!\nHaving said that, I'd actually be more inclined to leave stuff if it's just a few Kb.\nI have a .fontconfig folder, which seems to contain some sort of caching data related to my installed fonts; though it dates from a decade ago.\nSoftware often uses hidden .files at the user home level for temporary files (which may then not get tidied up); config files (particularly in Unixy or cross-platform software); or even authorisation credentials/licensing.\n\nA: re your .android folder. Some apps may have Google Analytics built into them, and use that folder to store preferences. Mine contains an analytics.settings JSON file, which indicates to whatever software is using it whether I've opted-in to analytics collection, I presume.

It does seem as if it is, as my old MBP with Big Sur works perfectly with the smb shares.\nHave you all seen this behavior with Monterey, and how did you fix it?\n\nA: I found the solution that seems to have fixed this for me on OMV forum.\nApparently, this is a behaviour exhibited when one of Your SMB shares has Time Machine support enabled and You're trying to copy into another one (where it's not enabled).\n\nWhen you enable TMS support on just one share you end up changing the \"vfs objects\" configuration of all shares in /etc/samba/smb.conf on OMV6 it changes all shares from:\n\"vfs objects = \"\nto\n\"vfs objects = fruit streams_xattr\"\n\nTo verify if this is indeed your problem, you could try to temporarily disable all shares' Time Machine support. For me, this resolved the issue (I don't get The operation can't be completed because you don't have permission to access some of the items when trying to paste a folder anymore.)\nIf you need to have Time Machine support enabled on some shares, you can try this temporary workaround:\n\nway around this is to setup everything the way you want it and then add the following line to the extra options of each non Time Machine share:\n\"vfs objects = \"\"\nThis is kinda horrible because it adds two \"vfs objects\" line to each non TM shares in the smb.conf but the last one added via the extras takes precedence.\n\nJust remember that if you edit /etc/samba/smb.conf manually, any changes done via OMV UI will overwrite Your custom settings.\n", "Q: wget - How to create local subdirectories when using ‘-P prefix’ ‘--directory-prefix=prefix’?

And it's not complete, because those in-app lists simply list the window title, file name, or whatever and not the Desktop Workspace.\nSpecifically, to start, I want to list all the open TextEdit windows and all the open Typora windows. They have very different UIs for showing that list themselves.\nEventually, I would like to have a small app window in the corner of each Desktop Workspace that displays a name or other ID for that desktop space. Then I could change to a different desktop by activating that app window and then putting it in the background.\nMost significantly, this would allow me to change to the same working desktop even if I have rearranged the order of desktops in Mission Control (because the target window would move with the whole desktop). Normally, Mission Control changes the numbering of the desktops and the assigned hotkeys then point to whatever desktop is now in that numerical position. IMHO, this is one of the key flaws in Mission Control that has kept people from using it extensively.\nSo far I have found the Apple JSX method/function $.CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo(16, 0)\nThe first argument sets some filters on the data returned. Here 16 is the value of the constant $.kCGWindowListExcludeDesktopElements, which excludes desktop icons, the desktop itself, and some other \"windows\" that can't be seen. The second argument is a window ID to allow you to select windows in front of or behind that specific window, so 0 shows all windows.\nThat method typically dumps hundreds of items that need further filtering and massaging. Here's one entry  as formatted by js-beautify:\n$({\n    \"kCGWindowLayer\": $(0),\n    \"kCGWindowAlpha\": $(1),\n    \"kCGWindowMemoryUsage\": $(1248),\n    \"kCGWindowSharingState\": $(1),\n    \"kCGWindowOwnerPID\": $(1410),\n    \"kCGWindowNumber\": $(322),\n    \"kCGWindowOwnerName\": $(\"TextEdit\"),\n    \"kCGWindowStoreType\": $(1),\n    \"kCGWindowBounds\": $({\n        \"X\": $(0),\n        \"Height\": $(679),\n        \"Y\": $(23),\n        \"Width\": $(385)\n    }),\n    \"kCGWindowName\": $(\"Which Apps Have I Used.rtf\")\n}),\n\nIn this example, the kCGWindowBounds place it at the left margin of the screen, at the top (immediately below the toolbar), a bit taller than it is wide. Fine. But it doesn't tell me that in Mission Control it's in Desktop 16.\nIf I had multiple displays, I could figure out which display it was in because those values treat all the different displays as a single desktop. An X value of over 1440 (the width of my laptop display) would put it in the monitor to the right of my laptop, if my laptop was leftmost.\nBut HOW do I determine which Mission Control Desktop Workspace that particular app window is in? Especially, how do I determine that for a number of windows, without having to actually activate and go to each window to find out which desktop is now active?\nThere are some apps that have been able to do something like this in the past, notably HyperSpace and CurrentKey, but HyperSpace didn't work beyond OSX 10.11 and CurrentKey has been withdrawn due to time limitations on supporting a free app and inability to support the Monterey OS.\n.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Related: https://stackoverflow.com/a/67338053/13100156\nI found that none of the example code would produce a result when I ran it in Script Editor (on Monterey), but the second example script runs fine under TextMate.\n\nIt is interesting that this counts two windows for Todoist, but only one is visible.  It counts four windows for Preview, but only two are visible.  Not quite sure what that's about.  The only visible window on the Space I ran it on was TextMate.\nThe example does not show the desktops the windows are on, but it would be a start for you.\n", "Q: App reported \"in use\" that isn't I downloaded a Catalina installer which can't run because I am already on Monterey.

The computer is a relatively new purchase and I recall something like 60 days as the maximum value I'd seen there.\n\n\nA: If you want AppleCare, call Apple tomorrow to be sure the dates are correct.

Apple is letting you know by their records you’re about to get locked out of the option to extend or renew coverage.\nIf their records are correct, you’ve got 23 days to decide, but I’ve seen their systems fail in the past. Better to talk with them and make a decision now so you can renew.

Someone else asks about using a USB floppy drive on a modern Mac, and the answer is that they \"still work\".  This implies that the answerer is talking about a USB that previously worked on a Mac, but that doesn't clarify whether a USB floppy drive marketed as a Windows product will also work for Macs.\nSince that question is unclear, I'll make it very explicit:  Can we assume a USB floppy drive made for Windows will necessarily also work on a Mac?\nTo make the difference between my question and the other question absolutely clear, I'm not talking about whether a new version of macOS will continue to support hardware supported by an old version of macOS, in this case a USB floppy drive.  I'm asking whether there is any reason to expect that a USB floppy drive marketed for Windows will fail to work with a Mac.\n\nA: USB floppy drives are generally made to work as \"mass storage device\" class devices (I have tried many different products, and they all work this way).\nThis is supported on macOS - and it works on all Macs, no matter if it is Intel or Apple Silicon. It doesn't make any difference at all.\nThere's no difference at all between USB floppy drives for Mac and for Windows as such. They work the same way for both platforms.\nYou can use the floppy drive with macOS software, or you can use it from Windows - BootCamp or virtualized Windows - doesn't make a difference at all.\nThe only thing you need to keep in mind is the type of floppy disk you want to read - that has to match the drive's capabilities. I.e. it hasn't got anything to do with whether you're using the USB floppy drive on Windows or Macintosh, but you have to ensure that your drive actually supports the type of floppy you want to read. I.e. it's not given that a drive that supports reading from IBM-compatible 1.44 MB 3.5\" disks also supports reading from Mac formatted 400 kB 3.5\" disks.\n", "Q: Update Apple ID Settings (iOS) - Enter Mac Password \"Enter the Password you use to unlock the Mac\" with correct password reports \"Incorrect Password\" On my iPhone (iOS 15.5), the Settings app displays a notification \"Update Apple ID Settings\".\n\nWhen I open it, I get informed that \"Some account services will not be available until you sign in again\".\n\nWhen I tap to Continue, first I get requested to enter my Apple ID Password:\n\nThen I get requested to enter my iPhone Passcode:\n\nFinally I get a prompt to enter my Mac Password:\n\n... and this is where the process seems to fail for me…\nThe dialog reports Incorrect Password, while I'm convinced that I entered my Mac password correctly.

I used a simple random password generator to create a reasonably secure password ... only to get it rejected with a \"Password contains invalid characters\" error message, repeatedly.\n\nThrough trial and error, I discovered that it actually doesn't like it when the password is too long. A 32-character password is fine, but a 33-character one produces this error.\nThis seems counter to many security recommendations, though. And arguably, the error message should tell you what's actually wrong; the current one is misleading. But I digress.\nIf there really are \"illegal characters\", which ones are they?\n(I suppose it would be useful to understand whether the restrictions on allowed passwords are dictated by the actual PDF spec, or just an arbitrary bug which Apple could fix, but that's bonus points territory.)\nI searched the Apple forums for any mention of this problem, but I seem to be the only one who is wondering about this. I also consulted Adobe's documentation for PDF Reader, but that doesn't mention any restrictions on allowable passwords, either.\nThis is on an up-to-date MacOS Monterey (12.5) installation.\n\nA: Section 7.6 of the PDF standard (ISO 32000) covers encryption.\nhttps://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:32000:-2:ed-2:v1:en\n(Ironically, you have to pay for a copy of an open standard.)\nPasswords in the 1.7 standard are stored as a 32-byte string of characters in the Latin-1 Unicode range.

Apple sets up Macs to sleep and save energy by default. Setting aside energy use, is it bad for me to run Mac mini for an extended period of 7 days by preventing sleep and without turning it off?\n\nA: Probably the opposite; the boot processes usually involves a lot of CPU and memory and disk activity, moreso than a system idling or in sleep mode, so I would expect a system that is frequently powercycled to wear out sooner than one that is left running, on average. The system frequently powercycled would probably also consume more electricity, unless the boot process is somehow made quick and efficient, but it's hard to see how that would use less energy than idling or sleeping.\nAn electricity usage monitor on the power line to the computer would be one way to test this hypothesis, on the assumption that higher electricity use means more wear and tear (and a higher power bill).\n\nA: No, that's not bad in any conventional manner.\nI run Mac Minis for months and years without powering them off (except the occasional reset for security updates).\n\nA: We've been using about 15 Mac Minis as a production servers for 8-10 years.\nThey regularly kept 60-70% CPU for a good part of the workday and also ran maintenance/backup tasks at night.\nNone of them failed.\nWe did not use Mac OS, so I cannot vouch about it. But the hardware was OK.\n\nedit:\np.s. now that I remember, the original disks quickly (2-3 years) filled up and were replaced with some third-party, reasonable-sized ones. None of the original disks (neither SSD, nor HDD) failed, one of the third-party disks did, but RAID1 does wonders. This goes to say that neither the thermal design, nor the power supply was borderline or dependent on the particular disk models.\n\nA: It depends on what you use it for.\nI am using a 2014 Mac Mini as my backup server.

I want to hear myself sing as I sing. With QuickTime Player and Garage Band, there is a big delay between an external mic (Blue Snowball) and AirPods Pro headphones. When the AirPods Pro are also the microphone, the delay is shorter but still noticeable.\nIt looks like a software problem to be because the laptop can record in real time (clearly!) and it can stream audio to headphones- so the software must cause the delay?\nI am using a MacBook Pro M1.\n\nA: There is no way round this [without buying new hardware].\nLatency is inherent on both the input and output - bluetooth considerably more than hard-wired USB.\nThe way this is avoided in [semi] pro setups is to use a USB interface with a direct feed straight back to the user's [wired] headset, avoiding the round trip through the computer entirely.\nUsing something like GarageBand or Logic, you can switch to a low latency mode, which bypasses any high latency plugins currently in use. You still cannot ever achieve zero latency by this method.\nWhen recording into any kind of DAW, the input latency is compensated, so the sound once recorded sits correctly in time. You cannot do this on the fly, only for playback.\nWithout external hardware, your shortest latency would be the USB mic to a wired headset via the DAW. Most DAWs you can change the buffer size, lower buffer == lower latency. The lower limit on this is when the computer can no longer provide sufficient processing power & drop-outs will occur.\n[A quick Googling tells me the buffer size isn't adjustable in current versions of GarageBand, unfortunately]\nPart of the problem of having a Blue Yeti or similar USB mic is you can't route directly through a USB interface - you have to send the mic through the Mac. An XLR-cabled mic would go into your\nUSB interface thereby allowing the mac to be bypassed.\nYou can get a basic entry-level [but perfectly serviceable] USB interface starting around $£€30. I'd always suggest searching an actual 'music store' rather than eBay, as there are a lot of even cheaper devices that are not up to the task. One reputable large EU-based music store is http://thomann.de/gb/usb_audio_interfaces.html\nBehringer is generally accepted as being the 'functional bargain basement' of pro audio manufacturers.\n\nA: You need wired earphones for this.

It has left the rest of the history intact, from the beginning, right through when it first decided there were two Downloads drives, a year ago.\nThese versions therefore appear to be orphans. They don't belong to any current drive.\nThis has now left the entire history with a name change half-way through.\nSetting it to 'delete all' from both the first date [Jun 2021] & latest date now changes nothing at all. [I understand this is only triggered when you Cancel back out of Time Machine & may take some time. I gave it 4 hours, nothing appears to have changed.]\nSo, I'm left with trying to see if I can persuade tmutil to deal with it. Not the entire Mac, & not one date at a time - there are 100 individual backup instances in the history.\nUsually when Time Machine fails [which it does with alarming propensity], the only recourse is to erase the entire drive & start over. It would be nice, for once, to not have to do this.\n\nA: Thanks to Gilby in comments, it's true that tmutil can use wildcards, which felt like it ought to make the task easier.\nHowever, I realised during this investigation that tmutil gives an error Invalid deletion target (error 22) when asked to delete an individual 'drive folder' from inside any backup 'date'.\nAs to why this may be, this post on MacRumors started me in the right direction\n\nThe man page for tmutil says:\n\"\ndelete path ...\nDelete one or more snapshots, machine directories, or backup\nstores.\"\nI believe that the path you gave was none of those three things. In your path, I think \"Backups.backupdb\" is a backup store, \"MacPro\" is a machine directory, and \"2018-11-26-201925\" is a snapshot. If I understand the man page, you want to delete what is called a backup source -- and apparently the tmutil delete verb won't work on that.\n\nSo, tmutil will simply not work for this purpose.\nIt's long been known that trying to use Finder or rm to delete files in Time Machine causes all sorts of permissions errors. I discovered a 'get out of jail free card' in the form of the Time Machine Safety Net helper, bypass.

These photos are in iCloud photos as well, and the originals on my Mac.\nMy Mac is only 500GB, so it was full, with only 10GB left. Now I bought a 1TB external SSD.\nWhat I did:\n\n*\n\n*In Photos I 'paused' the updating/downloading, because it seemed stuck. Probably not enough space to download the latest photos.\n\n*Turn off the internet on my MacBook\n\n*Copy the Photos Library to the SSD\n\n*Open that Photos Library in Photos, and set it as System Library\n\nNow it says \"Uploading 72.xxx photos\". I know it's probably not uploading, but checking if they exist in iCloud. At least that's what I'm hoping...\nBut it's terribly slow. So far it has been on for 3 hours, and it has gone through 200 items, of the 72.000. In Activity Monitor the network speed is at 0 most of the time, and every minute or so a very small peak in \"Sending\". With this speed it's going to literally take weeks to complete.\nAlso I hope it won't get confused when suddenly there are new items available in iCloud that my iPhone has taken and uploaded in the meantime.\nPhotos seems to not be doing much at all. Is this normal? Is there any way to speed it up?\nOr would it be better to create a new Photos Library that will download all originals from iCloud?\nIf I do that, what do I lose? The saved faces only (which I can regenerate of course)? Or is there more?\nIt seems a bit ridiculous that it goes through all the photos when I just moved the library to a different disk without making any changes.\nWaiting weeks is also something I don't like, as then the new originals form my iPhone are only in iCloud and not backed up to my Mac.\nThanks\n\nA: Most internet in the United States is very slow for uploading, at least from Comcast/Spectrum and similar. They choose not to invest in their infrastructure...\nAnyways, yes this is normal under those conditions. The merge process takes a long time when you have a slow upload speed. I don't know why but it's how it is.\nUnfortunately, it's usually better to create a new photo library and mark it as the system library and download everything, versus uploading everything. If you don't have un-uploaded data locally you can still do this. Hold the option key while opening photos.\n", "Q: Notification from the settings app on iOS?

I tend to take a lot of videos with my iPhone 12 (iOS version 15.6) but usually crop them to only keep the significant parts.\nHowever, I noticed that videos recorded and cropped almost 2 years ago still show the original and it lets me revert changes to restore the original.\nSo my questions are:\n\n*\n\n*How long does it keep the original (and potentially unnecessarily clutters up space)\n\n*Is there a way to change this setting?\n\n\nA: Apple keeps an unmodified original of all photos and videos you take indefinitely. A crop, rotation, transformation operation takes negligible space since it gets applied in real time. Trim operations allow you to save as a new clip and then delete the source video.\nThat being said, there’s no setting to harvest “original” versions of photos or videos over time. You would need to save a clip or duplicate it in a different app if you need to manage that storage with more granularity.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/edit-photos-and-videos-iphb08064d57/ios\nThen delete the original which gets rid of both versions of the file and you keep the crop or edit or cut version only as the new “original”.\n\nRevert an edited photo\nAfter you edit a photo and save your changes, you can revert to the original image.\n\n*\n\n*Open the edited image, tap Edit, then tap Revert.\n\n*Tap Revert to Original.\n\n\n", "Q: macapps.link - possible attack vector - could you pipe through some security script A work colleague said she is using https://macapps.link/en/ to help speed up software installation on company Macs.  Choosing apps to install results in a terminal command like this:\ncurl -s 'https://api.macapps.link/en/chrome-etcher' | sh\n\nThis screamed attack vector to me since if that site is hacked then the result could be a malicious payload.\nI guess https://brew.sh/ is the same:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nIs there any script that the results could be piped through before hitting | sh (etc..) to check for malicious actions?\nAnd of course there is what is downloaded (eg. chrome.dmg)  but then that is a separate problem that would be needed to be solved with virus software (or put the DL URL through https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload).\n\nA: No, there's really no such script. It is impossible to create a script that will warn against every possible type of malicious action.\nYou could possible create a script to setup a sandboxed container for the program to run in - but the point of an installer is usually to put files outside the container, otherwise there wouldn't be the need for an installer. So I doubt that approach is practical here.\nAlso note that merely inspecting the contents of that link before running the command is also not enough to detect malicious actions. One thing is that it could be hidden and disguised to look like innocent code, another ting is that the server is actually in some cases able to detect whether you're downloading the link to inspect it or to run it.\nInstead of piping the contents of links into bash, I would advise using a package manager for installing software that offers reasonable security features such as for example checking  signatures on software before installing.\nOne of the most popular package managers for macOS is Homebrew. It is relatively weak in terms of checking software for authenticity, but it does check that the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded software package matches the hash that their package maintainer has listed as valid. With HomeBrew you can speed up software installation by similarly installing multiple software packages in one go with a simple commands such as:\nbrew install --cask chromium thunderbird alfred insomnia\n\nThis will install Chromium (browser), Thunderbird (email/calendar), Alfred (productivty) and Insomnia (API client).\n", "Q: How to make my HP USB flash drive (uses APFS) writable?

As of macOS 12 Monterey, Cocoa is the sole primary API to develop macOS applications.\nEven though SetFile and GetFileInfo are still available on macOS 12 Monterey with Commandline Developer Tools, they are expected to become unavailable in the future.\nThe above citations from the manpages sound that the commandline commands SetFile and GetFileInfo accompanied Carbon.  As Carbon was removed from macOS X 10.15 Catalina, and as Cocoa is now the sole primary API for developing macOS applications, I thought that there should be new commandline commands that accompany Cocoa, replacing SetFile and GetFileInfo.  This is why I said \"successors\" of SetFile and GetFileInfo.  Is there any commandline tool accompanying Cocoa, working like SetFile to set the creation time of files and directories?\n\nA: The setfile and getfileinfo commands (with the Command Line Tools installed) are functional on Monterey 12.5.\nThe easiest way to see their syntax usage information is to do:\n/usr/bin/GetFileinfo\n/usr/bin/SetFile\n\nThat said, ls -OUTl will expose a file's flags and birth (creation) time on the terminal command line. The birth time/date will be in lieu of the modification/accesstime field and the field between the group and size values will be the file flag(s). For a locked file, you will see uchg.\nA convenient way to lock a file is chflags uchg ... To unlock, do chflags nouchg ....\nALTERNATIVE SOLUTION\nAn alternative to using SetFile change to a file's birth (creation) time, is to use touch -t. This will set both the birthtime and modification time to the argument provided.\nWith touch, the birthtime cannot be set forward of its current value, but can be decremented into the past. SetFile allows changing the time forward or backwards.\nThe following script can be used to alter a file's birthtime while retaining its original modification time.\ncat chtm.sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n# Set a file's birth (creation) timestamp while leaving the modification\n# (mtime) unaltered.\n\n[ $(uname) = \"Darwin\" ] || { echo \"'$0' must be run on macOS\"; exit 1; }\n[ $# -ne 2 ] && { printf \"Usage: $0 [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS] file\\n\"; exit 1; }\n\nt=$1\nf=$2\nstat -f \"BEFORE: btime: %SB, mtime: %Sm\" $f || exit 1\n\nm=$(stat -f \"%Sm\" -t \"%Y%m%d%H%M.%S\" $f)  # capture the old mtime\ntouch  -t $t $f || exit 1                 # update  the btime & mtime\ntouch -mt $m $f || exit 1                 # restore the old mtime\n\nstat -f \"AFTER : btime: %SB, mtime: %Sm\" $f\nexit\n\nA sample run would be:\ntouch myfile\n./chtm.sh 202212311711.00 myfile\nBEFORE: btime: Jan  3 12:19:21 2023, mtime: Jan  3 12:19:21 2023\nAFTER : btime: Dec 31 17:11:00 2022, mtime: Jan  3 12:19:21 2023\n\n", "Q: OS compatibility for older Mac Can my Mac Pro (Mid 2010) use Mojave? Right now I am using 10.13.6.\n\nA: No. High Sierra is the limit1 for a 2010 Mac... unless you go for an unofficial dosdude1 type hack.\nNote that if you have a Metal capable GPU then Mojave might work on a 2010 Mac Pro.\n\n1 See Wikipedia for the official supported platforms against the Mac models: High Sierra, Mojave\n\nA: You can 'officially' put Mojave on a 2010 Mac Pro, once you put a Metal2 GPU in it. The barrier to upgrade drops away, no further hack required.\nSuch as an AMD[ATI] Radeon HD 7950 will work. Make sure to get one that's already Mac-flashed, otherwise you won't be able to see the screen before login or use FileVault.\nAvoid NVidia, they don't have drivers after High Sierra. AMD drivers are built into the OS.\nOnce the card is in, the update to Mojave will require a firmware update as part of the OS update. The instructions say to hold the power button until it flashes - in fact you need to hold it longer; it will eventually reboot itself, then you can let go. This took a lot of trial & error at the time.\n", "Q: iPad 2 in the year 2022 I own an iPad 2 (MC980/A) with 32 GB of storage in good condition. It has no scratches nor cracks. It runs iOS 9 as the latest software. Any suggestions about things I could do with my iPad 2 are very much appreciated.\nCan I get newer third party applications, operating system or other software for this iPad?\n\nA: The iPad 2 was released with iOS 4.3 and you're now running iOS 9.3.6 as the latest. Given that the product was launched in 2011 discontinued in 2014 and received as recently as July 2019, you will have received somewhere from 8.5 to 5.5 years of first party software updates. This is considerably more than the industry standard. I doubt that Apple will ever make new releases for this iPad in terms of the operating system and their built-in apps.\nRemember that Apple has not stopped you from using the product, they have not disabled your operating system and they have not removed your installed apps. It still runs iOS 9 and the app it had installed. You are simply not receiving new software update from Apple anymore.\nThe main problem with old operating systems on any device is security when connected to a network. It is simply not wise to connect such a device to the Internet for example - unless you do not care that you risk getting malware, virusses, etc. It is not something Apple has dictated - that goes for any device from any vendor running any kind of operating system. You could argue that Apple should keep making updates for their devices until the last sold product breaks beyond repair. This is not really reasonable though, as the costs of producing such updates are much, much higher than most realize.\nYou can however download new software from the App Store that third party app developers have made available for older versions of the iPad.\nMany third party app developers unfortunately do not support older iPads for that many years. Apps such as for example Instagram are not isolated islands - they require a set of servers in the cloud to talk to. Instagram could decide to keep supporting their old apps indefinitely, but they have chosen not to - so at some point, their app stopped working - and they withdraw it from the App Store for those, now unsupported devices.\nYou can also install third party software from outside the App Store. You can do that by compiling and signing apps yourself and addding them to the iPad (the signing has to be redone periodically).\nAnother option is to jailbreak the device to install software from any third party. There's many jailbreak tools out there for the iPad 2. You do not need to connect the iPad to a computer to install the jailbreak.\nNote that after jail breaking, you'll find that most third-party app stores have also stopped supporting these old iPads. It's not just a big burden for Apple to support old devices, it is also so for third parties.\nIf you're looking for new stuff to do with your old iPad, there's plenty of projects and ideas that you could start on. An old iPad could be used for example as wall-mounted remote for a music system, it could be used as an alarm clock on your nightstand, it could be used a digital photo frame, it could be mounted in your kitchen solely for easy access to recipes, etc. Plenty of stuff you can actually do with an old iPad.\nThere's also the option of gifting the iPad (for example donating it to a charitable organisation). If you find no use for it at all, and do not want to gift or sell it, make sure your recycle the device. You can often hand the old iPad in at any Apple Store for recycling - depending on which country, you reside in. For more details look here.\n\nA: As this question on alternative OS for iPad explains, no viable third party OS option exists today yet jailbreaking might help with side loading old non-Apple store apps.  Be careful since you’re now a bit more responsible for watching for malware and bugs, but those risks can be managed with education and network monitoring.\n\n*\n\n*No new os\n\n*No new apps\n\n*Some ability to side load old apps\n\n*Some chances you could write custom apps using old development tools\n\nAs long as the hardware is sound, the device will continue working as it is, and you can continue to use it in the way that you have always done. I'd suggest that the device will serve as a general media viewer/player: PDFs, ebooks, music (perhaps not videos with only 32Gb); also for taking notes.\nHowever, you are right that as time goes by, the browser becomes less capable in rendering modern websites; it also will have vulnerabilities that won't get patched. You won't be able to download new apps, because those apps rely on newer OS versions.\nApplications are (very crudely) instructions for the Operating System to follow. Each new OS contains new instructions. New versions of applications might use the new instructions, and older OSes can't understand those apps.\nThere comes a point when the cost to Apple of continuing to support older devices outweighs the number of such devices still in use. You can argue that Apple ought to do more to allow or help with jail-breaking and running some other OS on older devices; though doing so might have security implications for newer devices.\n\"To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven: a time to keep, and a time to throw away.\"\n\nA: I sometimes use it as a secondary monitor. You have to use a Mac companion app to connect to the iPad. There are multiple solutions, I found Yam Display useful because it supports my iPad 2. You can use your iPad as a monitor on wifi or with USB. There is a time-limited free version you can try.\n", "Q: Consequence of removing iPhone from list of trusted devices If I remove an iPhone from the list of trusted devices in AppleID does the pin code set for that phone still work and protect the phone?\n\nA: Yes, the phone code (i.e. the code to unlock your phone) remains the same and still works. The main difference in future will be that for every 2-factor authentication you can not use this iPhone any more. I.e. when you want to sign in to iCloud on a different device, you have no option to allow that login from this iPhone, which means you need a third device.\n", "Q: MSMTP on Monterey: msmtp: no recipients found I have MSMTP running flawlessly on four Raspberry Pies.

Occasionally, when I open an app on my Mac, regardless of what app it is (Activity Monitor, Safari, Preview, Photos, etc.), it would just bounce indefinitely in the Mac dock, without ever launching.\nI am, in general, able to continue using any apps that are already running. This is why I don't always notice that the problem has occurred yet, because I'll only notice it when I launch another app.\nHowever, one time, I was watching a video in VLC, and after halfway through watching a video, I tried to pause it, but I couldn't pause it (while I was in fullscreen mode), and that's when I knew the issue occurred again. I confirmed this by opening other apps, and they bounced indefinitely in the dock.\nThis issue could start whether I'm at my Mac or away from it. Also, I already have the option disabled for putting hard drives to sleep when not in use.\nAttempted solutions\nI posted EtreCheck results to a Gist, so please take a look to see if there might be any software that is causing the problem. I chose the \"Apps are crashing\" option.\nDeleting com.apple.finder.plist file\nI tried trashing the com.apple.finder.plist file, but the issue still persists afterwards. Restarting Finder through Force Quit (Relaunch) only quit Finder, but did not launch it back up. Also, after the issue occurs, I can't even Log Out or Restart my Mac; I must force restart my Mac by pressing and holding the Mac's power button (it's a Mac Mini).\nChecking crontab\nResults:\n$ crontab -l\ncrontab: no crontab for gary\n$ sudo crontab -l\ncrontab: no crontab for root\n\nMac updates\nI already have Mac automatic updates and App Store automatic updates completely disabled. I manually perform updates once a week.\nTimes when the issue happened\nI started having this problem after I bought a new Mac, which also forced me to upgrade my MacOS from MacOS Catalina to MacOS Monterey. I got the new Mac on July 15, 2022, about a month ago. I migrated everything from my old Mac Mini to my new Mac Mini. It's possible that the issue is caused by something that was migrated from the old Mac, so you can take a look at the EtreCheck report linked above to see what that might be.\nI noticed a trend that the issue would occur roughly every 72 hours. I don't know why that would be, though, since my routine is occasionally different, such as I'm sometimes away from my Mac, when the issue occurs.\nHere is a list of the times that the issue occurred:\n\n*\n\n*2022-08-06 at 7:00 pm\n\n*2022-08-10 at 10:03 pm\n\n*2022-08-13 at 9:29 pm\n\n*2022-08-16 at 10:57 pm\n\nPossible solutions\nIs there anything I could check, to get some clues? For instance, is there any console logs to check? I briefly checked logs in the Console app, but couldn't find anything relevant to the issue. The amount of information in the Console app is also overwhelming, so I'm not quite sure where to start.\n\nA: As you can see from the report, you have a lot of software running in the background, (in the form of System Extensions, Launch Agents and Launch Daemons) and you should check whether you really need it all, and whether it's up-to-date and compatible with your current Mac. (Even if it's not the cause, it's good housekeeping.)\nIt looks like you've brought over lots of ancient software from your old Mac.\nFor instance, you have lots of obsolete Internet Plug-ins that are from years gone by: Flip4Mac; Google Earth, Adobe PDF Viewer, Silverlight, and Office Live.\nLAcie Desktop Manager -- third-party disk management tools are often the cause of problems, particularly if not up to date. You don't really need them to run external drives.\nYou've also got Paragon NTFS drivers (but no NTFS drives). Again, do you need them; are they up-to-date?\nMegaSync? check if you really need it and it's up-to-date and compatible.\nSteerMouse: It's exactly these sorts of softwares -- driver extensions and things that modify the OS's behaviour -- that are likely to cause problems with new OS versions. Ideally, I'd want to disable it to test whether it's causing a problem, before deciding to keep it.\nIs that Cocktail? The need for 'maintenance' or 'cleaning' apps is over-stated. Do you need XQuartz from 2012? (There is an M1 compatible update.)\nThere are also remaining fragments of other software that you've deleted. (Proving that AppCleaner isn't worth having either!)\nI would certainly test running the computer without some of these third-party processes running for a while. Try running in Safe Boot mode, which will disable all these things from loading, and see if the behaviour still occurs.\nIt may be easier to do a wipe, then migrate your user data and settings, then only install the apps you need.\nEtreCheck report also says you're running out of disk space. I'd try and keep 50Gb of space free, if possible, though not easy with a 256 Gb drive. Hopefully, you can delete some obsolete and unnecessary software to get some space back.\nAlso, is the Seagate drive a hard drive? Check whether it is/isn't spinning down and then spinning up again. I know you've said you've turned off that option, but some drives have a built-in sleep function.\nYou've turned off Apple Security Updates, which is a bad idea, too.\n", "Q: Unable to Wipe and reformat an SSD Drive - wiping volume failed I've run through a range of solutions offered on the forum\nThe disk came from a Windows 10 machine and I wanted to wipe and install another OS but have been struggling.\nI gave up on the actual PC as I made little progress with USB boot tools.

Keep in mind this is BT 2.1 era. It is likely that this keyboard/BT standard is simply no longer supported by these newer Operating Systems.  It’s not unheard of for Apple to simply drop support for obsolete products.\nIf your Mac connects to other Bluetooth devices, it’s technically working.\nTry testing the keyboard with a different computer.  If it works there, then it’s narrowed down to a compatibility between that keyboard and the OS.\nWhat could be the incompatibility?\nBased on when it was released, it could be the Bluetooth encryption method the keyboard employs is no longer supported. BT 2.1 and this keyboard (A1314; AA batteries, no recharging) were all released roughy around this time so the keyboard may not have the latest BT 2.1 specification that was available at the time. This will take more research to confirm.  If it was an earlier BT spec, it may not be capable of encryption and the new OS might require it making them incompatible.\n", "Q: Will my Python script still run while screen saver is on? If I'm running a Python script locally on my MacBook Terminal prompt (MacBook Pro Laptop running on BigSur) and the computers screensaver comes off while it's idle, will my script still run?

I had just reset my whole MacBook and while I was reconfiguring, I'd decided to keep the menu bar visible as all time (was kept hidden before). Right now, whenever I'm switching screens (3 finger swipe), the menu bar will then follows the screen and moves. I think this is redundant since all the menu bar needs to change is just the application you're currently focusing on.\n\n\n\nA: No. Apple designed this intentionally.\nYou would need a different window manager to allow the chrome to operate differently than the content.

We are from the UK and had a phone stolen two days ago, we are in South Africa for another month.\nThe UK network provider is sending another SIM to our UK address as it can’t be activated from abroad. So we have bought a new phone in SA, restored it from an iCloud backup and using a local SIM card.\nWe don’t want to lose the WhatsApp chats we had, so have opted not to install WhatsApp on the new phone (SA number) until we get back and can put in the new SIM. It’s a pain as WhatsApp would be useful from here. Although I’m now wondering whether we can in fact use WhatsApp with the new number now without losing the old chats in iCloud and then restore the old chats when we’re back in the UK and on the UK number.\nCan iCloud store backups to two different WhatsApp numbers? As each one is specific to a phone number and not the Apple ID I’d have thought so but I don’t want to risk losing data.\n\nA: \nCan iCloud store backups to two different WhatsApp numbers?\n\nNo.\nIf and when you perform a backup of WhatsApp chat on iCloud, it overrides any previous backup.\nIf you wish to regain access to your old (original) chat once you have access to the new SIM for the original number, it's advised that you don't perform any backup over iCloud with the new (temporary) SIM installed.\n", "Q: Macbook screen is not perfectly smooth Several days after purchasing a MBP M1 Pro I noticed that the screen is not perfectly smooth. I wasn't able to capture this on camera.\nIf I turn off the screen, and then look from the side so something reflects off the screen, like a light from a window, I notice that the screen is kind of wavy, having little vertical things and it reminds of the pattern that a plastic screen protector would show.\nI wonder, is this normal?\n\nA: This is totally normal - the screen should be mostly smooth and not a perfect plane.\nIf you can’t photograph the minor wobble, it’s likely inconsequential but you would need someone who has seen dozens of these to confirm my understanding that you’re reporting a normal manufacturing tolerance and not a defect in assembly is precisely what you’re onserving.\nThe screen components and assembly are engineered to present light to your eyes correctly and not be perfectly flat. If you place a ruler or other straight edge it should be mostly smooth but not perfectly smooth when you inspect it from an acute angle (say less than 10 degrees from parallel to the hinge) while off.\nTo check this, turn on your Mac, open numbers (or excel) and reduce the zoom so that a large table looks like a checkerboard and closely inspect the visible straightness of the lines from 90 degrees to the plane of the screen (sitting normally in front of the Mac). You should be able to snap a photo of that - being sure to correct for the specific lens disortion of your camera if you want to measure things and be sure your eyes are correctly observing the light put out is straight.\n\nA: I couldn't catch those ripples on camera but found a similar one on some forums (not my picture)\n\nThen I just went to Apple Store and checked if those have the same ripples.\nApparently, every laptop without an exception did have those ripples. Then I checked another store and the same story.\nLooks like, this is as designed. And now Apple laptop screens do have those ripples. They are not that noticeable, you really need to look from the side and catch the correct lighting to see it\n", "Q: updating an EFI Firmware on an unsupported iMac running Monterey I'm running Monterey 12.5.1 on a late 2013 iMac (iMac14,2) using OpenCore Legacy Patcher. This model should only be able to run the latest version of Catalina hence the need to use OCLP. Using SilentKnight suggests that the EFI firmware needs updating. My understanding is that it relates to a recent Security Update 2022-005 Catalina, which came out after I had already updated to Monterey. My questions are:\n\n*\n\n*Does it matter?\n\n*And if it does should I try to update the firmware by booting into Catalina from an external drive (if that's doable)?\n\n\n\nA: From personal experience & from what I can gather from Eclectic Light [the maker of SilentKnight] firmware upgrades are done as part of an OS install, or upgrade.\nI don't think simply booting from Catalina will do it, You'll need to install or update Catalina whilst booted from it.\nThis was certainly true for Mojave, which I was part of the beta test for. Every single beta update had you re-applying the firmware update again, whether it needed it or not.\nSee https://eclecticlight.co/2019/10/08/which-efi-firmware-should-your-mac-be-using-version-4/\nand https://eclecticlight.co/2021/03/23/how-to-update-your-macs-firmware/\n\nA: I managed to get the firmware to update to the latest for my iMac model. I made my computer dual bootable into either Monterey or Catalina. Set my startup disc to Catalina, restarted but with a NVRAM reset (after something I read on the MacRumours forum), then reapplied the latest Catalina security update and the EFI version updated.\n\nA: I was able to also use the above procedure to update my MacBook Pro 9,2 from 233 to 429 by installing Catalina and the latest security updated on my second internal SSD drive.  I have 2 SSDs in this MacBook Pro and I have Ventura with OCLP installed on one drive. I installed Catalina to the second drive. I did the CMD-OPT-P-R NVRAM reset then installed the latest security update to get the update.\nI updated a MacMini 2012 6,2 from 422 to 429 EFI as well by loading Catalina and the latest security update and performing a OPT-CMD-P-R NVRAM reset. This also runs OCLP.\n", "Q: How do I move Facetime and other apps to different directories? My Applications folder is getting very cluttered, and I would like to organize.  Step one: move all the internet tools to an \"Internet & Network\" folder.  Chrome, check.  Firefox, check.  Facetime...what's going on?\nWhen I try to move Facetime it creates a duplicate in the new directory, leaving the original still sitting like a fat cat in the Applications directory.  But that's not all: many other apps refuse to move either (TextEdit, Safari, Photos, etc etc).\nHow can I move these apps? Sounds simple, but apparently it isn't.\n\nA: Simple advice - don’t attempt to organize the Applications folder.\nmacOS has protective methods in place to keep this from happening, as you have experienced first hand.\nIf you want create some order out of the chaos you think exists, create aliases of the apps you want to organize conceptually, then put the aliases in folder, (perhaps in ~/Documents,) with conceptual titles, lastly drag the folders into the Dock for easy access.\nI created the conceptual folders with conceptual icons, too, years ago, using an app which has fallen by the wayside. I can't even remember its name. You can always use the \"Display as Stack\" Dock option, too.\n\nI, myself, do this for various conceptual groupings: Final Cut Pro, Compressor, Logic Pro X, Motion in one folder for Apple creative apps; InDesign, Photoshop, Acrobat for Adobe apps, etc.\nThis has worked like a charm for me for more than 15 years.\n\n\nA: You get to arrange apps in your home folder and not the system folder.

When I'm watching videos late at night I often turn the volume way down. I'm finding the iPhone volume increments from the physical push buttons are not very fine grained, it seems like a coarse big step between each button press. From mute to first audible sound I'd like something smaller in-between the two levels. I'd basically would like a smaller increment. Is there a way to control how sensitive the button is to volume adjustments?\n\nBy way of analogy I'm thinking of something analogous to what you typically see in a car stereo setting where the volume increment per volume knob adjustment is configurable.\nTo use a concrete example something like found in an Alpine stereo where you can adjust how loud the audio is from an Aux or Bluetooth device by controlling the decibel gain of the device from the UI.\n\nAUX VOL (AUX volume level) Adjusts the volume level for each connected\nauxiliary device: [+18 dB] – [0 dB] – [-8 dB].

What are some key features to look at? I've got several more days before FirstAid and TimeMachine ever might finish. I feel like I need to return the drive. Should I really just keep waiting?\n\nA: You probably don’t need to return the drive. Trying to wait or repair this drive is futile and distracts from your good instinct to determine if the drive is working.\nIt’s not optimized for having the first backup interrupted. It's likely IO bound on operations and seeks - not for normal copies.\nHere’s how to proceed.\n\n*\n\n*Remove it from time machine as a destination.\n\n*Erase the drive (that should take a minute or two max)\n\n*Go into options for Time Machine - exclude the Users folder and exclude all connected external drives\n\n*Watch how long it takes to back up just your Library and Applications\n\n*Let two more backups happen\n\nOnce you're sure the drive is working - choose a time when you can let it chew through all your home folder and then remove the /Users exclusion. Or add in small chunks of data so you can not interrupt a large backup, since it has to redo all the work and then re-complete the long backup. That interruption tripled or worse the load / IO needed to complete that interval. Better to start with smaller chunks of data in this case.

The panic log, AFAICT, only says that the SSD stopped responding.\nA few things you could try:\n\n*\n\n*Perform an SMC Reset - this sometimes resolves power-related issues like the battery not charging\n\n*While booted into your system, start Console, then disconnect the power adapter, wait for the computer to freeze and re-connect the adapter before the system crashes and auto-reboots. This may generate some logs that could help further narrowing the issue down. (You could also monitor internal voltages, temperatures etc. using software like iStat Menus.)\n\n*If the above does not work, try booting from an external media (HDD/SSD/flash drive) while powered from battery. Is the internal drive visible and reliable? Does it appear/disappear when connecting/disconnecting the adapter?\n\n(As I can't post comments, I ask an additional question here. Sorry.) Did these problems happen even before you had you battery changed?\n\nA: NVRAM data is potentially corrupted...\n\nbut if you try to boot the machine when disconnected from the power the ? folder icon is shown indicating that the machine cannot find the boot drive.\n\nIt sounds as if the NVRAM is becoming corrupted; possibly because there's insufficient current from the battery.  The NVRAM is where it stores boot time environment variables like which volume to boot from.  If it loses this info while on battery, but works fine on power it definitely points to a power issue.\nDoes this mean your NVRAM is bad.  No. A low power condition could cause \"glitches\" like too low of a voltage to adequately read the data stored on the ROM chip.  Without putting hands on and using some high-end test equipment (like an oscilloscope) it's impossible to know for sure; but it's a reasonable hypothesis.\n\nThere have also been occasions when using the machine on battery power that the machine will suddenly shut down without warning and then when powering back up will show the ? folder icon. After reconnecting to power to reboot the Mac will present the \"You shut down your computer because of a problem\" dialog.\n\nThis is a clear indication that you battery has failed or is defective.  Basically, it cannot hold a charge.  It's important to note that your Mac (and modern computers for that matter) will try to estimate how much battery is remaining and gracefully shut down/hibernate should the charge level drop.  If it's dropping this drastically, the battery has a bad cell(s) causing it to run out of juice faster than the Mac can act.\nA new battery can be defective...\n\nThe battery itself is good as this was recently replaced by Apple and only has 13 cycles on it.\n\nThere is no guarantee that a new battery with very few cycles on it is reliable.  There are a number of factors that can contribute to this:\n\n*\n\n*It may be a NOS (new old stock) battery.  It's new, but sat on a shelf for a few years.\n\n*It has a manufacturing defect. Unfortunately, this happens in a world where goods are produced by humans.\n\n*It may not be genuine Apple (unlikely if Apple replaced it, but nobody is perfect)\n\nReturn it to Apple...\nApple normally gives a warranty period for replacements.  If you recently replaced this battery (within 12 months) then return it to apple and tell them that the battery is faulty.  There is no software fix and no amount of resetting the SMC and/or NVRAM is going to repair it.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\n*\n\n*Mac Battery malfunctioning in just 2 years\n\n*Why does a 12 inch Macbook refuse to turn on with a lot of battery remaining unless it is plugged in?\n\n*My Macbook Pro M1 2020 is not starting up without being plugged in and battery icon shows a cross with fans turned on\n\n*Battery not charging at only 35 cycles - recoverable?\n\nA: So in the end I decided to try replacing the SSD which has fixed the issue. I went with a 128GB Western Digital SN520 SSD which is working well.\nNote that before trying the Western Digital drive I tried a Samsung MZALQ1280 128GB SSD but it turns out this drive has a firmware incompatibility with A1708 MBP's, resulting in a folder ? icon during macOS install process.\n", "Q: I need to add Hebrew and Greek fonts on my Mac air 12.5 Monterey for seminary class Professor requested that both Greek and Hebrew fonts be loaded to my Mac so I could read them when they pop up in a paper.  Cannot seem to find a method that works.  Is adding a font the same as changing the keyboard?  I do not want to type-just read it.\nSw\n\nA: Installing a font is as easy as moving it to the Fonts folder inside your user account's Library folder.\nThis folder is sometimes hidden by default, but you can get to it from the Go menu in the Finder.\n\nIf it doesn't show here, hold the Alt key.\nAlternatively, you can put the fonts into the Fonts folder in the root-level Library folder (at the top of the disk hierarchy).  This will make the fonts available to all users on the computer.\nThere are plenty of fonts with Greek and Hebrew characters already installed. Times New Roman, STIX General, Georgia, Baskerville all have Greek characters -- though they may not have the full range of diacritics.\nArial Hebrew, Corsiva Hebrew, New Penimim MT all have Hebrew characters. There may be others. (Noto Sans has variants for pretty much every script ever -- including Egyptian Hieroglyphs and Cuneiform!\nIf you're asking about how to access those glyphs from the keyboard, then yes, you'll need to change the Input Source, which defines what characters you get when you press the keyboard. You can do this in System Preferences > Keyboards.\nHere are examples of Unicode Greek and Hebrew (John 1:1 and Genesis 1:1) which you should be able to read on your Mac without any additions:\nἘν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος\nבְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ\n", "Q: iTerm2 and Zsh - cannot change prompt in .zshenv at startup I have 2 Macs, an old iMac in my study and a MacMini in my workshop. I have iTerm2 on both of them. The MacMini is new and I'm still fine tuning the setup. I use zsh for my shell on both and the same .zshenv on both. I have done all I can to make sure I'm using the same iTerm2 settings on both. The problem is that I can set the prompt in .zshenv on my iMac, but the same .zshenv script does not do a thing to the prompt on my new MacMini. (And I have changed the shell to zsh and have checked to be sure I have.) I am NOT using Oh-my-zsh. I just found out about that and may add it later, but this issue is really irritating me and I want to get it fixed.\nHere's the relevant code:\nPROMPT='%F{magenta}%B[%b%D %* %n@%m %1~%B]%b $ %f'\nuname=`whoami`\nif [[ \"$uname\" == \"root\" ]]; then\n    PROMPT='%F{red}%B[%b%D %* %n@%m %1~%B]%b $ %f'\nfi\necho \"Prompt = $PROMPT\"\nexport LS_COLORS\necho \"About to export prompt\"\necho \"Prompt = $PROMPT\"\nexport PROMPT\n\nI'm getting the following behaviors:\n\n*\n\n*When I open a new window or tab, it reports the proper value for $PROMPT from the script. It does not change my prompt from %n@%m %1~ %#.\n\n*When I check the value (after .zshenv as run), it comes out to %n@%m %1~ %#.\n\n*If I copy and paste the line from the script that sets the prompt, it changes the prompt to what I want.\n\n*If I type ./.zshenv it runs and I get DOUBLE output from the echo commands, as if it's run the script twice and it does not change the prompt.\n\n*If I type source .zshenv it runs, I don't get repeated output, and the prompt changes.\n\n*If I copy the line that defines the prompt from the file and paste it into the terminal, it changes the prompt.\n\n*When I check other variable values and aliases from .zshenv, they have been imported into the shell from the script.\n\nI also just checked on the normal terminal program. I had not thought to check this before. I get the same behaviors on the normal Mac terminal program, too.\nThis is the same script from my older Mac (which as been kept up to date with regular Apple upgrades), but it behaves differently on this Mac.\n\nA: The issue is that zsh also reads files from /etc as well as your own ones.\nApple now provides a /etc/zshrc that includes\n# Default prompt\nPS1=\"%n@%m %1~ %# \"\n\nthus removing your changes. (In Mojave - ie before zsh was made the default /etc/zshrc does not contain this )\nThe zsh manual gives the startup files order.\n\nCommands are first read from /etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden. Subsequent behaviour is modified by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options; the former affects all startup files, while the second only affects global startup files (those shown here with an path starting with a /). If one of the options is unset at any point, any subsequent startup file(s) of the corresponding type will not be read. It is also possible for a file in $ZDOTDIR to re-enable GLOBAL_RCS. Both RCS and GLOBAL_RCS are set by default.\n\n\nCommands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv. If the shell is a login shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile and then $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile. Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are read from /etc/zshrc and then $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc. Finally, if the shell is a login shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.\n\nThe manuals say that zshenv files are read by all zsh invocations and zshrc is read for interactive. As running in the terminal and showing the prompt is only used when you want to type in the terminal then $PS1 should only be set in zshrc files and not zshenv files .\nThat is move your code from ~/.zshenv to ~/.zshrc\n", "Q: How to extract How uncompress .tar.lrz file? I have .tar.lrz file in mac which I have to decompress.\nI have already checked How uncompress tar.lz file and the solution there does not work. I think the reason is that is for tar.lz and I am dealing with .tar.lrz\nI am trying decomprees file from https://github.com/lin-tan/CoCoNut-Artifact/releases/tag/training_data_1.0.0\n\nA: You need the lrzuntar command, which is yet-another-compressor (it seems it's basically LZMA) in a package called lrzip. You can install it via Homebrew:\nbrew install lrzip\n\n\nA: For a GUI app which can uncompress tar.lrz, use Keka. After installing Keka (from the Mac App Store) you can use it from Finder. Select your file, control-click, Open with, and then choose Keka.\nKeka is rather slow with the tar.lrz linked in the question.

Let me know what other information you need.\n\nA: After some more hours of investigating I think I've found the issue myself: In my case it seemed to be the \"Cisco AnyConnect Socket Filter\" and/or \"Cisco Secure Client\" App that was installed on my laptop, even though they weren't active.\nFor reference here's a summary of the issues I experienced:\n\n*\n\n*ping google.com doesn't work at all or randomly loses packages\n\n*fans are very loud, laptop is hot.\n\n*in activity monitor we can see that a process com.cisco.anyconnect.macos.acsockext consumes a lot of cpu.\n\nAfter I uninstalled the Cisco apps (Both \"Secure Client\" and \"Socket Filter\") the issues were gone and everyting worked normal again. (In Applications folder -> cisco/ I clicked on \"Uninstall Any connect\".\nHow to reinstall Cisco if needed\nMaybe just a clean reinstall is enough. In my case I sticked to this post to make sure that com.cisco.anyconnect.macos.acsockext process is under control:\n\n*\n\n*I clicked Don't allow when asked: Cisco AnyConnect Socket Filter” Would Like to Filter Network Content\n\n*I simply uninstalled the Cisco Socket Filter App but kept Anyconnect client. In my case the Cisco App is working as needed, but this may of course be different in other scenarios.\n\n", "Q: How to deal with two mail binaries? I recently installed both msmtp (smtp client) and mailutils on an M1 iMac via MacPorts. I couldn't get msmtp to work until I realized that there were two mail binaries on the machine, one that, I guess, is native and one installed by mailutils:\nValentine:~ mnewman$ which -a mail\n/opt/local/bin/mail\n/usr/bin/mail\n\nUnfortunately, the wrong one was being used if I tried to send mail from the Command line which caused msmtp to fail. I tried to fix it with:\nValentine:~ mnewman$ alias mail=\"/usr/bin/mail\"\nValentine:~ mnewman$ type mail\nmail is aliased to `/usr/bin/mail'\n\nWhich works, but I think there must be a better way. Is there?\nEdited to show why I need to use /usr/bin/mail rather than /opt/local/bin/mail with msmtp:\nValentine:~ mnewman$ /opt/local/bin/mail me@mac.com\nCc:\nSubject: none\ntest\nmsmtp: no recipients found\nSending data to /opt/local/bin/msmtp failed: Process exited with a non-zero status\ncannot send message: Process exited with a non-zero status\nValentine:~ mnewman$ /usr/bin/mail me@mac.com\nSubject: none\ntest\nEOT\n\n/opt/local/bin/mail fails while /usr/bin/mail works\n\nA: What you can do rather than use an alias or change the PATH order is create a shell script called mail and put that in a directory before either of the mail executables. I would put /usr/local/bin and/or a local bin ~/bin or nowadays ~/.local/bin at the front of the path. This script will then act like any other executable and be available to any other program just like your current mail executables, whilst an alias is just a text replacement when you type mail at the beginning of a command.\nThe mail script would be like - note this is totally untested.\nIt calls explicitly the executable you want and passes all the command line arguments to this.\n#! /bin/sh\n/usr/bin/mail $@\n\n", "Q: Using bluetooth on an old Watch App I have an old watch app called Zepp Tennis. Part of its feature is allowing access to a sensor on the end of a tennis racket which then displays the tennis racket’s speed right on the watch. It requires accessing the watch’s bluetooth to do this. Due to a lawsuit this company is now out of business and it seems unlikely that they’ll change this app at all.\nI have a problem where it seems as if this feature is not possible on WatchOS6, because it doesn’t ask for Bluetooth permission correctly. But it is possible on WatchOS5. I was able to get it to work on an old watch right before I tried to replace the battery and it bricked. If anyone else can test if this works on WatchOS6 please let me know.\nHow can get I simply give this outdated app the necessary permission to use Bluetooth so that it works on WatchOS6? To be clear, the watch needs to connect to the sensor directly - not through the phone.\nIt is impossible to add a new watch to an apple account that uses WatchOS5. Apple will always auto update it to WatchOS6 before adding the watch, annoyingly.\n\nA: Updated answer - This is actually a problem with the iPhoneOS. The iphone ios 14.7 correctly transfers the bluetooth permission to the watch. Testing with an ios15 phone, the watch never received the bluetooth permission.\n", "Q: Is there a list for all the apps that support game center I need to search an apps and look whether it supports game center. However, I only want play the games with Game Center. So, is there a list that includes all games which supports Game Center?\n\nA: No, there's no such publicly available list.\n\nA: Apple calls this out in the native App Store apps and on the web as well.\n\nI know scraping the content of this catalog is directly against the rules, so that might be why people don’t share their results (or get a complete and ongoing correct dump in the first place) if they try to scrape the data directly from, Apple.\n\nYou may not use any \"deep-link\", \"page-scrape\", \"robot\", \"spider\" or other automatic device, program, algorithm or methodology, or any similar or equivalent manual process, to access, acquire, copy or monitor any portion of the Site or any Content, or in any way reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Site\n\nIf you are passionate about this, maybe starting a blog or discord server and making a game review site that curates this in a crowd sourced or labor sharing manner would be useful to others?\nShort of Apple making it easier to filter apps, I don’t see this changing anytime soon.\n", "Q: What tool can I use to create a partition table on a disk image (.dmg)? I am trying to port an operating system development project to macOS. The problem here is that the project uses a tool called parted which is only available on linux, not macOS.\nThe parted tool allows you to create a partition table on a disk image (.dmg). Add/Remove partitions and format that partition to types such as Master Boot Record.\nMy goal is to find a macOS tool that is able to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Create partition table on an image\n\n*Create a new partition\n\n*Format that partition to be a Master Boot Record\n\n\nA: The tools of choice are hdiutil and diskutil. Check the respective man pages for details on how to accomplish the tasks you want to accomplish. Basically\nhdiutil create -volname DISK -size 32m -fs FAT32 disk.img\n\nwill create a 32m FAT32 image.\n\nA: Not sure why the other responses consider this an \"XY problem\".\nDisk Utility lets you create a new disk image (with MBR and MS-DOS) -- but it doesn't let you create/delete partitions the way it does for Apple disks.\nYou can create an initial single-partition disk image using the Disk Utility > File > New Image > Blank Image...     (or hdiutil).\nYou may need to double-click on the resulting .dmg   (or \"attach\" it using hdiutil).\ndiskutil list will list which disk images MacOS is aware of.\ndiskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk4 2 MBR MS-DOS BOOT 100M MS-DOS NAME R\nwill repartition the disk (creating TWO partitions named BOOT and NAME). The first is 100 MB, the second uses the \"REST\" of the available space.\nSee man diskutil for how to use the \"partitionDisk\" verb.\n\nA: Using the Terminal, here's a relatively simple guide:\nStart by creating a \"blank file\" of the size you want - for example 1 GB:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=image.img bs=1024 count=1M\n\nNow you want to take that file and make it accessible as if it were a real disk (similar to loop-back mounts on Linux):\nhdiutil attach image.img -nomount\n\nWe're using \"nomount\" as we have essentially a blank disk with filesystems to mount. The output of the above command will be the device node that the file is now accessible through - for example:\n/dev/disk4\n\nIt is very important to note this particular device node and use that in the following commands.\nDO NOT JUST COPY THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS WITHOUT UPDATING THE DEVICE NAME\nNow you can create a new MBR partition table on the virtual disk like this:\nfdisk -i /dev/disk4\n\nYou can specify specific default templates for how you want the disk initialised by adding the -a flag. For example -a dos would create a single DOS partition on the drive.\nAfterwards you can run fdisk interactively in order to remove and add partitions as you like:\nfdisk -e /dev/disk4\n\nUse for example the command edit 1 to edit the first primary partition. You can use the help command to get more information.\nNote that if you do not absolutely need MBR (which could very well be a requirement for a simple OS development project), you would probably be better of with a GPT partion table, which you can create using the gpt program instead.\nAfter you have created your partitions, you can see their corresponding disk nodes using diskutil like this:\ndiskutil list\n\nIf you have used the \"DOS\" template above and the main disk device node was /dev/disk4, you would find the first partition available as /dev/disk4s1.\nNow you can format the partition using the file system you want.\nWhen you're done working with the image file, you'll want to detach it like this:\nhdiutil detach /dev/disk4\n\nNow the image file is ready to be used for whatever purpose inside a virtual machine for example.\n", "Q: Help me find Order Number for Specific iPhone SE I need the Apple Order Number for the following:\niPhone SE (2nd Gen) A2275\n\n*\n\n*Unlocked and SIM-free.\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchased from Apple retail store. Was never subsidized or locked by a carrier at any point.\n\n\n\n*in black\n\n\n*128gb\n\n\n*Slim retail package. Only includes iPhone SE and Lightning to USB-C cable.\nThe reason this is challenging is I don’t have the device and my research shows Apple did a \"refresh\" of the 2nd Gen in which they removed the EarPods, Lightning to USB-A cable, and USB charger. The began to only included a Lighting to USB-C cable and changed the packaging to a \"slim box\" with a M***3LL/A number that doesn’t match the Everymac database in the answer posted\n\nA: EveryMac is usually a good place for these kind of details -> MXCW2LL/A\n\n", "Q: Help needed for SSD Installation on an Mid-2012 MacBook Pro with BootCamp I have a 13-inch Mid-2012 MacBook Pro, and I want to switch over from the HDD (1 TB) to SSD (1 TB). I am concerned about the following things:\n\n*\n\n*I have BootCamp installed, so when I install the SSD, will I be able to get all the files from both BootCamp and MacOS as they are right now?\n\n*I have installed a Patched version of Big Sur on my MacBook Pro, and I have had to enter the following commands (only if I reset the NVRAM) or else it will not allow me to boot up (the crossed out circle sign):\n\n\n\n*\n\n*nvram boot-args=\"-no_compat_check\"\n\n*nvram csr-active-config=%7f%08%00%00\n\n\nWill this create further problems? Or would I be able to boot up without any issues?\n\nA: There are two main points:\n\n*\n\n*You need to transfer everything from the old disk onto the new disk.\n\n*You need to be running an OS while you're doing it!\n\nSo, you need to have both the old and the new drive connected to the computer at the same time. This usually involves an SATA-to-USB cable or external disk enclosure box, which are quite cheap.\nI've used either SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the entire disk in the past; you'll have to check whether they can deal with BootCamp partitions.\nOtherwise, you'll have to setup BootCamp anew on the new disk, and then transfer the Windows partition from the old disk separately.\nIt goes without saying that you should make sure you have a backup of everything before proceeding.\n\nA: Basically you should get away with dd if=/dev/hdx of=/dev/hdy (dd) executed in macOS Recovery's Terminal, where if is source and of is destination. Don't accidentally swap IF with OF or you will erase contents of your source drive. This will copy device-to-device by 512-byte blocks keeping your partition map (including EFI contents required to boot Windows). Here's a short quote of a good write-up on how it works with screenshots and example that fits your need perfectly:\n\ndd (disk duplication) is a Mac OS X command-line utility which can\nread raw data off a disk, even if the Mac doesn't understand the\nfilesystem. There's also a freeware version of dd for Windows\navailable, with instructions.\n\nP.S. Windows might not boot after disk has changed (cloned to). This should be possible to fix this way. Boot to source Windows drive, attach destination drive with cloned partitions, mount EFI volume of destination drive to letter V: (Command Prompt > diskpart > list disk > select disk 2 (2 is your destination drive, double-check this) > list partition > select partition 1 (1 is EFI partition on destination drive, should be 200 MB) > assign letter v: > exit or Win+R > diskmgmt.msc > right-click EFI on external drive > Assign letter), execute Command Prompt command BCDBOOT Z:\\Windows /S V: /F ALL (bcdboot, perhaps you could use BIOS or UEFI instead of ALL but I don't know type of your installation) where Z: is your external drive's Windows partition. Please note that you should track disk number, partition and letters by your own, it's just an example. After that Windows partition on newly cloned disk should become bootable again. Once again, it maybe good to go without this extra step of re-writing boot sector.\nP.P.S. If you're not sure what you're doing you may also try using Clonezilla, here's a video example.\n", "Q: Is there a way to set the ambient light sensor's value? I have a 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. The said Touch Bar is flickering from time to time (to the point it hurts my eyes) and does not even light up the rest of the time. It looks like the problem is coming from the hardware but after looking thru a lot of documentation and experimenting a lot it looks like when I expose the ambient light sensor to a flashlight the motherboard is sending more power to the Touch Bar's screen and the flickering stops.\nTherefore, I am trying to find a way to set the ambient light sensor's value to something that would stop the screen from flickering. I do not know if this is even possible but I do not have the money or the competencies to fix the bad hardware. Sorry for my bad English :)\n\nA: No, there's no built-in way of setting the readout of the ambient light sensor.\nTo further complicate things, it is very difficult to \"hack\" such a setting in. The Touch Bar runs on its own processor with its own operating system and application code - completely separate from the ordinary macOS operating system.\n", "Q: Can I view the watchOS install history to see what version of watchOS I had before the current one? I just recently updated my Apple Watch to watchOS version 8.7. Long back story, but I'd like to know which version of watchOS I was running before that. Is there any way to find that information on the phone or watch?\n\nA: I found an answer, but not one that would work for everyone.\nIt seems pieces of health data have metadata associated with them including the watchOS version used when that data was recorded. Using the Health app, I was able to see which version of watchOS I was using before the update.\nThis solved my issue, so I thought I would update.\n", "Q: I am trying to reset to factory, but the menu says I need to update, but there isnt enough room on the device to update I followed the recovery directions to trigger the recovery menu for the locked iphone 7.\n\nWhen I go to restore the phone to factory settings, I get a menu that says I need to update the phone.\nHow can I restore this phone to factory settings?\n\nWhen I click install, I am notified that I do not have enough space and the restore stops.\n\nIf I try to skip the update by pushing \"not now\" the restore does not continue. The same issue happens when I try to just update the phone separately first.\n\nA: The \"Installation failed\" message is letting you know that you haven't got sufficient free disk space available on your computer. Not the device.\nSo you just need to free some disk space on your computer, then you can download the necessary update and restore the iPhone to factory settings.\n", "Q: Keep folder names the same on all places I localized my Mac to Brazilian Portuguese so the folder names appear as \"Imagens\", \"Documentos\" in Finder, but on the terminal the English names are kept: \"Documents\", \"Pictures\". To avoid the confusions that I've been having, is there a way to keep the language of the system but keep the folder names consistent on all places? I don't care if they are in Portuguese or English, I just want to keep the same name in Finder, in the shell, etc.\nTo be more specific, I don't want to change the system language to English, I want to keep it as Portuguese, but I want Finder to show the real folder names (in English) and not the translations.\n\nA: Localization only impacts how Finder shows the names, it doesn‘t change the names itself. So you can\n\n*\n\n*switch the system back to English\n\n*create symlinks for the portuguese names in Terminal.\n\n", "Q: Integrate Grammarly with Slack I used to have Grammarly and Slack integrated. Every time I wrote a message in Slack, I had Grammarly suggestions, but when I replaced my computer, I couldn’t make that work again. I am unsure which steps I followed to make it work, and I couldn’t find the solution on Google.\n\nA: It sounds like you had the Grammarly desktop app. Maybe you just need to re-install it, should work in most apps where you can type.\n", "Q: Original \"default\" background color for Preview windows?

If you click on it, it still will be blank. The note saves anything what you wrote or spoke, but without spaces, and after restart, you can work it over. The screenshot below does not show this in full since there is still a space in the first note, but it catches the problem well enough.\n\nAfter such a bug, how can I get the notes back without restarting the iPhone?\nOther official Apple forum questions that deal with the same thing (searched for \"notes often empty and need restart iphone\"):\n\n*\n\n*Another 202010 question for an iPhone 11 shows that it is still there for this higher model, see iPhone notes vanish often until I restart phone.\n\n*202006 My iPhone notes keep going blank after updating to iOS 13.1\n\n*My iPhone notes show up blank all of a sudden\n\n*Same question was asked in the same forum long before 2019 as well, link was removed. This thread was removed only up to four months after asking this question after being out there for many many years... I try not to see a link... I wanted to write down the year of the question in an edit and must see that the link is dead. I can only guess and vaguely remember that \"long before\" was something old, could have been 2014-2016 or even earlier. Perhaps it was also just removed for its age.\n\nWrapping up the links, the problem must have been known for a (very) long time.\n\nA: TLDR:\nFor example, on an iPhone 7, being in the Notes app showing nothing, double tap the home button, swipe up, open Notes again.\n\nThe first answer in that forum from 2019 says it already.\nIf you run into this bug, you do not need to restart the iPhone. You can just follow the guide at Close an app on your iPhone or iPod touch.\nThat is, just close the app. I forgot that there were so many apps open, you see them when double-tapping the home button (older iPhones) or when swiping up to the middle. And then swipe through the open apps to find the Notes app and close it by swiping it up.\nIf you open the Notes app again, the notes will be back without a restart.\nSince this problem does not seem to come up with the Apple iCloud Notes, it seems not too far-fetched that this is a bug on the wishlist: \"kindly switch to Apple iCloud as the storage for your notes, since the other services are buggy\". Aim: locked-in effect, and who knows, perhaps they have some anonymized NLP running? Surely not. Just a little bit alerted. Also strange: the oldest link (I can only guess the age: half a decade or even more) that is listed above was removed only a few months after this question was put here.\n", "Q: Which exact color space is \"RGB\" in MacOS Finder's \"Get Info\"? In MacOS Finder, if I Right Click > Get Info on an image – in this case a .PNG file – I see that it says Color Space: RGB.\n\n*\n\n*When Finder says \"RGB\", which exact color space specification do they mean?\n\n\n*Is there any way I can tell exactly which color space specification this is?\n\nNB 1: My ultimate objective is to find what is the exact color space specification of a .PNG image, and the proximate objective is to understand what exactly Finder means by \"RGB\".\nNB 2: The file is from GIMP, so I think it might be an sRGB color space specification.\n\nA: The Finder knows only the broadest term - RGB. If there is an embedded profile, that will be used by any graphics app when opening the file.\nWithout a profile it will open in Photoshop etc as 'untagged RGB' which is to all intents & purposes assumed to be sRGB.\nPNG files cannot contain CMYK images, only Greyscale, Indexed & TrueColor,  so at least that confusion is eliminated, but Finder cannot tell the difference between, say 'standard' RGB & Indexed colour, only between colour & greyscale.\nLeft to right - truecolor, indexed & greyscale.

If you turn off grammar checking it reverts to just flagging this particular one.\n\n\nA: Generally, the grammar in the example sentence is quite poor, but the checker is actually technically suggesting a spelling change, not grammar.\nApple's grammar checker is generally terrible & will let many things pass.\nIts spell-checker makes similar mistakes and often will suggest incorrect replacements. Off/of is a common one.\nI tend to leave both checkers on just for a visual guide, but I never let it make automatic corrections, just because of its propensity for changing correct words to incorrect ones.\n[Also known as \"Damn You Auto Correct\", or DYAC for short ;)\nNormally you would see squiggly lines underneath - which we're not seeing here because \"check as you type\" is switched off. Green is grammar, red is spelling.\nIn this particular sentence, though, both the grammar and spell checker will flag it, but with two different explanations underneath. The one in your image is the spelling reason, grammar says \"consider 'of' instead\" - which is, of course, just as wrong, but that's how we can clearly show the difference…\nSpelling…\n\nGrammar…\n\n\nA: Seems like this is a bug and that it's been there since Mojave.

When done using it, naturally I eject the volume by dragging it to Trash.  This unmounts the volume but the disk remains physically spinning.  Since this drive is powered by USB, when I then unplug the USB cable, it loses power while still spinning.\nI understand that modern drives handle this without damage, and that myths about the utter necessity of \"parking\" a disk are based on the hardware of 40 years ago.  However, I believe I have read that drives are rated for a much smaller number of these \"emergency\" spin-downs over their lifetime, compared to power-off with the drive already spun down, and power-off retract count is a specially tracked statistic in S.M.A.R.T. data (0xAE or 0xC0).  So my understanding is that, for longevity, it is still preferable to spin down the drive before unplugging.  How do I do that?\nGUI preferred but command line would also be okay.  Under Linux I would do udisksctl power-off but that command does not exist under MacOS.\nThere are several questions on this site about spinning down drives when idle, and how to set the timeout, but that wouldn't really help me unless I was to wait for the timeout after unmounting.\n\nTo be clear, if possible I'd rather not change spin-down times or other behavior in general.  I'm happy with the way the drive spins up and down while in use.  I just want to be able to spin it down after unmounting, or immediately upon explicit request.    Again, an exact equivalent of Linux udisksctl power-off would be ideal - you issue the command, the drive spins down right away, and its settings are otherwise unaffected.\n\nA: The spinning of hard disks can be altered in System Preferences.\nChoose the Energy Saver pane.\nIn that there is an option \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\" and check that on.\n\n", "Q: how to open large CSV file in mac os? I have a large CSV file with a total size of 214 MB.\nWhen I try to open this CSV file with Numbers, Number apps hangs.\nI have a mac m1 machine with 16 GB RAM.\nCan any one please tell me how to open a CSV file of this size in mac?\n\nA: Limits in spreadsheet apps are usually defined by maximum number of rows and cells, rather than file size. And some spreadsheet programs (in particular Numbers) may slow down significantly before the limits are reached.\nFor Numbers the limits in 2015 were 65536 rows by 255 columns - I can't find a recent reference to this but it is larger. I found on my disk a CSV with 300,000 rows by 3 columns (188MB). Numbers does open it, but takes a long time (~4 minutes).\nRecommend: Excel which has limits of 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns. See Excel limits.\nYou may need ~2 GB RAM for Excel for your 214 MB file (just an estimate). When I open my 188MB file, Numbers consumed 4.6 GB real memory!\nAlternatives:\nLibreOffice has, I understand, similar limits to Excel. You could also try that though it is a little slower than Excel with my 188 MB test file. Memory usage was almost exactly the same as Excel.\nDepending on what you want to do with the CSV, you may find it is sufficient to open it with a text editing app.  For that I recommend BBEDit, though TextEdit is likely sufficient.\n", "Q: Endless copying more than size of folder I'm trying to copy files from one HDD to another.\nFor some reason copying ''Backups.backupdb'' folder won't end.\nThe original size of the folder is 145gb,but when it hits 145,it is just adding more GBs.\n151/151\n\n152/152\n\nBtw,when copying stars,after 10-15 mins mac asked my for password to copy ''Backups.backupd''.Maybe this is the problem?It doesn't ask anything for other folders.\nUPD\nI have ''stop'' symbol on my folder,maybe this is the problem?How do i remove it,so my mac has access to it without pass.?\n\nA: Backups.backupdb contains the TimeMachine backup which uses hard links to preserve space (basically this ensures that files/folders only get backed up if their content changes). Wenn copying Backups.backupdb via Finder, these hard links are not rebuild, so copying it will create a folder containing a full backup for each time TimeMachine run. This is most likely not what you want (and it will need a huge amount of disk space).\nTo clone a TimeMachine disk, use a tool like SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner.\n", "Q: How to convert a pdf file where every page contains 2 pages, to 1 page pdf?

I realize you may have very compelling reasons to try, however.\nWhile you are researching this, start a new backup on the new disk. Set aside the old one until you’re sure you no longer need those backups, then decide to archive it or erase it.\nLets say you have 100 files and time machine backs them up 24 times in a day (once an hour). Instead of a reasonable copy time, you have to wait 20x longer for this copy. If you check how many files you are backing up, the math goes against you being willing to wait quickly.\nThis backup system is designed to optimize time to restore and to dramatically conserve space on disk, not to be quick to copy a destination.\nIn summary, the leverage for this copy to work rapidly doesn’t exist so you pay a large time penalty due to how it’s engineered.\n", "Q: USB-C external SSD works on 2 of 3 M1 MacBook Pros I have an ORICO dual-bay SSD enclosure configured for RAID 1.

Everything worked fine on that machine.\n\n*I don't have any other external USB-C storage to test with, to see if it will mount on my 14\" MBP.\n\n*The disk has never mounted or worked correctly on my 14\" MBP. I chalked it up to some weirdness with the RAID enclosure, until I plugged it in to one of the 16\" MBPs and observed that it worked as expected.\n\n*Sometimes, I can see the disk in Disk Utility on the 14\" MBP. The volume name never shows up correctly. If I try to format it, it fails.\n\n*It does not matter which port I plug the enclosure into - I have tried all three - and it does not matter if I have any other devices plugged in or not.\n\n*The USB-C / Thunderbolt / whatever-they-are ports work just fine; I have a dock plugged in right now, and it's working fine. Unplugging the dock - even unplugging the dock and rebooting - makes no difference.\n\n*Plugging the SSD in to the dock also does not work. Sometimes it shows up in Disk Utility; sometimes it does not.\n\n*I'm using the USB-C cable that came with the enclosure. It has worked just fine on the other two 16\" M1 MacBooks (even as of ten minutes ago), as well as on my old Surface Book 3 running Windows before I got rid of it a few months ago.\n\n*I have tried \"turning it off and turning it back on again\".

Does anybody have any suggestions?\nThanks,\n\nA: This isn't really a very good idea, though it is possible to some extent.\nYou do realise that will not make it a 'backup'. It will still be the only location for that file.\nMove the file to its new location.\nRight click it & 'Make Alias'\nCopy or move the alias back to the original location.\nThis will only work for some structures, such as contents of your documents folder.

I recently encrypted my drive using filevault. However, the process to encrypt seemed to be practically instant, while for others it seems to take quite a while. I'm wondering if my drive was actually encrypted or not.\nMy computer is a Macbook Pro (M1, 2020), Big Sur 11.6.8\n\nA: Yes - Apple Silicon macs always encrypt the drive whether your account is needed to decrypt it or not. It is instant to enable and disable and here is a moderately deep technical paper on it with some nice summaries that are good reading.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/security/volume-encryption-with-filevault-sec4c6dc1b6e/web\nAt a high level the VEK exists and enabling FileVault establishes a KEK which is then needed to boot the OS since the drive needs your password before the OS can be decrypted and start up.\n\nVolume and metadata contents are encrypted with this volume encryption key, which is wrapped with the class key. The class key is protected by a combination of the user’s password and the hardware UID when FileVault is turned on.\n\n\n\nA: What happens instantly is that your Mac knows you want encryption to be turned on. It will then start encrypting, and eventually everything will be encrypted. How much is actually encrypted isn't visible to you, but it will continue encrypting whenever your Mac is running.\n(Some people also have the problem that they use an encryption password and promptly forget it.

I regularly backup my iPhone and iPad devices to my Mac and for many years have been doing an encrypted backup.  Based on reading elsewhere like answer here and the comments I'm going to assume I did not select save backup password in Keychain originally way back when. I search in my Keychain and find no items matching \"Backup\" etc.  How is it that I can plug in the iOS device and make new encrypted backups without entering a backup password?\nThe only entries I'm finding in keychain related to my iOS devices is one for each device name of type\nRPIdentity-SameAccountDevice.  I don't know what these are for and my user password doesn't seem to unlock these keychain items.\nBackground:\nyep yep, I seem to have lost my iPad encrypted backup password. I didn't forget it, because I never knew it.  I use a password manager.  I have a iPhone backup password saved that works on my iPhone backup, but that password, nor anything else I can think of is working to unlock my iPad backup. :-/ I backed up this iPad without issue right before erasing it to do a little testing with a different account.\n\nA: The backup password setting is stored on the iOS device itself, and iOS encrypts the files as it sends the to the Mac. The Mac just accepts and writes the files without a lot of work done on the Mac itself during the backup.\nThe encrypted backup setting and the password for it are also saved in the backup itself (iCloud or iTunes), so if you set up that iPad by restoring a backup of another iPad or iPhone, the encrypted backup setting would be set on the iPad. Glad you found the password!\nFor anyone seeing this in the future, older keychain entries are named \"iPhone Backup\" or \"iPad Backup\", but it changed in the past couple years to be named \"iOS Backup\" now. I have an article I wrote with a handful of tips to try for a forgotten backup password, in case it's helpful to someone in the future also.\n", "Q: Extract 1 page from a password protected PDF I have a (large) PDF file generated by a payroll system. Because of sensitive data, this file is protected with a password.\nI would like to extract one page of file and have this page in a separate PDF file.\nI tried to Preview, but it is not capable of doing this.\nTo be more precise, I made an experiment such as I created a 2 pages password protected file on my Mac, I used Preview and I could successfully extract one single page.\nBut the same operation does not work with the file I have.\nWould somebody know why?\nDoes Preview has some limitations in reading/handling PDFs?\nBy chance, if anybody would know how to deal with such a \"special\" PDF file, it would be great to share.\nBest,\n\nA: There are different ways that PDF documents can be protected.\n\nA password can be required to open the document, but another password - the \"Owner\" Password can be set in order to restrict the access once opened.\nIt's likely that your document has restrictions against copying and/or editing the pages, which would prevent you from extracting a page.\n", "Q: How to downgrade macOS from a beta whilst retaining all data without prior backup I stupidly have lost my hard drive which contained a backup of my Mac when it was on macOS Monterey. I'm currently on the latest version of macOS Ventura and would like to downgrade.\nI can make a backup now but it would be from macOS Ventura is there anyway I can use that for the latest version of macOS Monterey?\n\nA: As it's a beta, the best we can say is \"nobody knows\".\nThe chances are you'll get most of it back but will lose any data that has changed structure, as such is Mail is likely to do at many OS boundaries. The rest you will have to pick out piecemeal, as there's no Migration/Time Machine method that will let you go 'downhill'.\n", "Q: Mac not booting after moving SSD and HDD to another Mac I had a mid-2011, 2.5GHz, AMD graphics, Mac Mini with an SSD and HDD using OWC’s dual drive setup. The SSD drive had the OS (10.11 I think) and the HDD had my home folder and an old version of OS X (10.7 I think). I was running this setup for several years, with updates to the newer OS, with no permission issues. The computer had a logic board or GPU failure (wouldn’t boot, power light on, no chime, blank screen, the fan immediately revs to full speed) so I purchased a replacement Mac Mini with the same specs and moved the two drives to the new machine. The new machine will not boot as intended.\nWhen I try to boot normally, the computer gets to the Apple logo and the spinning icon for a half second before shutting off. When I boot from a USB installation disk, I can get to Disk Utility, etc. The Startup Disk options screen does not show an OS on the SSD, only the HDD. Everything shows “OK” when running First Aid on SSD. Running First Aid on the HDD shows a permissions problem that may prohibit booting. Using Verify in the menu I can navigate the contents of the HDD but nothing for the SSD.\nA couple of places on the web have recommended creating a backup home folder on the SSD boot drive when creating the dual SSD/HDD setup, in case of permission errors or directory corruption, but they don’t explain what the consequences are or how to fix it if you haven’t done this and run into problems. I can’t remember if I created the backup home folder on the SSD.\nSo, what is keeping my Mac Mini from booting? Is there a corrupt directory or disk permissions gone haywire? If the problems involve my home folder, is there a way to create a new home folder on the SSD to make the drive bootable and then point the OS to the correct home folder on the HDD, all without overwriting anything currently on the SSD? I have a feeling I’ll be mucking about in the Terminal.\n\nA: *\n\n*If the new Mac Mini was manufactured after the macOS version you are trying to boot, it may not be supported and you may need to update the system first (installing a newer macOS to the existing disk via a bootable installer should preserve data, but you should make a backup just in case).\n\n*Try holding option/alt when booting and selecting the disk (to rule out Startup Disk issues - the Mac may be looking for another drive).\n\n*Try booting in verbose mode (Cmd+V) to see if there are any errors. Tip: if the text scrolls too fast, you can use a camera to record it and pause it or use slo-mo mode.\n\n*Try swapping the positions of the HDD and SSD (if the system at tries to mount the home by path e.g. /dev/disk1, it may make a difference). Depending on how the \"external home folder\" was set up, you may also need to update the path to match the HDD's location in the new machine. Also, if any other storage device/flash disk/card reader/... is connected, try disconnecting it first.\n\n", "Q: Why does Finder not search Python (.py) files for content? I want to search all my .py files for a certain expression, but it seems that Finder does not look at their content. Is this normal? What can I do?\n(This question was also raised here.)\n\nA: On my MBP with macOS v12.5.1, Spotlight (also in Finder) brings out any Python code file that has the expression being searched for in contents.\nPython code files are essentially text files. Make copies of a few in the same directory where the Python code files are located, rename their extensions as txt and see if those appear in your searches after a short while, assuming Spotlight is indeed active and indexing the files and directories on your computer. If even the new text files you created for testing don’t appear in your searches, then the directories they are placed in are excluded from Spotlight. In that case, you need to make sure those directories are not excluded via the System Preferences-> Spotlight -> Privacy window.\nOtherwise or in addition to the above, make sure everything is checked under System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Search Results window, especially the Developer and Other categories.\nAnother issue could be what  Python code files are associated with, i.e. which application opens them when they are double-clicked in Finder: on my MBP, they are associated with IDLE (the Python integrated development environment) and I can see contents of a Python file via Quick Look, i.e. by pressing space bar on any in Finder.\n", "Q: Read old login histoy from Time Machine Backup How can I read the login history of the last command before wtmp begins from a Time Machine Backup before the date of wtmp begins?\nIs there any way to do this by replacing some current files on my system with files of the backup?\n\nA: A partial answer, as I don't know where the last log data is now stored.\nFrom man 5 wtmp\nFILES\n     (These files no longer exist in 10.5 or later.)\n\n     /var/run/utmp     The utmp file.\n     /var/log/wtmp     The wtmp file.\n     /var/log/lastlog  The lastlog file.\n\n.. so you will be out of luck finding them to restore.\nMy first thoughts of this answer were that Linux last supports the -f flag to specify a file other than /var/log/wtmp but that option is not in the macOS last. Even so, the fact the files don't exist sort of accounts for that.\n/var/run/utmpx and /var/run/wtmpx may be the modern equivalents, but may also be part of TM standard exclusions (I think /var/run and /private/var/run maybe the same thing?), so you'd need to have something like a CCC backup.\nSorry for all the speculation. May be someone else has something further to offer.\n", "Q: Why are the font-sizes on macOS so small? For some reason, the font-sizes on macOS appear very small.\nFor example, if I use Apple's own Pages and set the zoom to 100%, I would expect it to represent the page accurately on my display. However, it is actually way smaller on the display. The same holds for Microsoft's Word. Only Libre Office's Writer seems to get the right result.\nSo, I am wondering what might be going on there and whether something can be done about it.\nEdit\nThis is on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014), 2880-by-1800 resolution at 220 pixels per inch.\n\nA: The original Mac came with a display that had 72 pixels per inch. This fitted nicely with the typographic unit, the point, so that 1 point on the page was 1 pixel on the screen. Thus 100% zoom was 1pt = 1px, and 'Actual Size'.\nAs technology improved, the pixel density of displays increased. 100% was still 1pt = 1px, but no longer Actual Size.\nIn the View > Zoom menu, Pages (and TextEdit, Preview, Safari, and most other native Mac apps) has a command called \"Actual Size\".\n\nIf I select that, I get a zoom magnification of 151%. This is because my display has a pixel density of 109ppi. 109 divided by 72 (pixels to the inch) gives 151%.\nEventually, displays got such high density that it made sense to scale everything by a factor of 2. Make everything twice as big, but pretend it's not.\nOn a Retina display with default scaling, the zoom factor for Actual Size should also be c. 151%. (219ppi, divided by 2, then divided by 72.)\nTL;DR: Press Command0 (that's zero) to get Actual size, and forget about the %.\n\nA: Windows uses a different pixel density. If you are used to 100% being readable in Word on Windows for example, it’s jarring to see that you need to increase zoom to 125% or more in Word on macOS to get the same relative font size on screen. Office seems to use the system pixel density to set screen display size. Pages apparently does the same. It’s a consistency thing - if you as a Mac user expect to have to set zoom to 125% in your word processor program, it’s easier to get you to switch to Pages if it uses the same scaling factor you already expect in Word.\nThe different philosophy behind what scaling factor should be presented to the user is not new. You’ll find a lot of similar questions dating back to WinXP and likely before if you search. Base difference in pixel density of the display seems to be the most commonly cited root of the difference.\n\nA: The standard zoom in Microsoft Word running on Windows to get true to life paper size on the screen is 150%. The origin of that is lost in the mists of time (i.e. I haven't researched it). This standard zoom carries over to the Mac version of Word.\nPages has copied the Word scaling. So to get paper perfect size, you must use 150% zoom.\nPages also makes it easy to set the default zoom to 150%. This is set in the General Preferences:\n\nOn Mac, that all works out so long as you screen is set to 220 ppi. A different scaling and a different zoom is required.\n", "Q: Make Mac behave as a USB-Keyboard for another Mac As part of a workgroup I am trying to run multiple bash commands in the recovery mode terminal.\nBecause we have a large collection of Macs, and because not all of my coworkers are experienced in scripting, I am looking to automate the process.\nAs another solution approach we have gathered all the commands in a scripts on a USB stick connected to the device, then execute the script with a USB-Scanner and a Barcode containing the execute command.\nIs there a way to have our Mac behave as a USB-Keyboard to another Mac, and let it input those bash commands when the terminal is open?\n\nA: We discovered using a Mac was a lot more work in recovery than either a proper KVM or an inexpensive $10 arduino device and some Mac software designed to automate keystrokes.\n\n*\n\n*https://twocanoes.com/products/mac/mac-deploy-stick/\n\nA: I stumbled across an app called KeyPad, which I know allows me use my Bluetooth keyboard for both my Mac and my iPad or iPhone, and it says it would work for other Macs as well, so...\n", "Q: How can I silently upgrade M1 macOS?

This leads me to believe it's a software (not hardware) issue. The stores' payment terminals had no issue with tap-to-pay using a physical card, so it doesn't seem to be an issue with the terminals or payment infrastructure at large. Apple wasn't having any availability issues with Apple Pay when I checked its status page at the time either.\nRemoving and re-adding the cards didn't fix the issues, and neither did a reboot. There were no outstanding updates for either device, and they had last worked for Apple Pay after I had last updated them, so an update hadn't affected its functionality.\nIs there anything else I can troubleshoot on the software side to try and resolve this before taking it to an authorized repair store for hardware testing? I really don't think it's a hardware issue, given that both devices' Apple Pay stopped working around the same time, and their Pay functionality isn't tied to each other. Apple Support confirmed there was no block on my account, and my card providers confirmed my cards are in good standing.\n\nA: On my iPhone, I first checked that the billing addresses were correct in Wallet for each card (... button at top right for each card, and then scroll down for Billing Address). Then, in the Settings app, go to Apple ID->iCloud, scroll down and toggle the Wallet property to off, wait a bit, then toggle it back on. This seems to force a state sync between devices and whatever's stored in iCloud for Wallet card info.\n", "Q: CD player won't play any CDs burned on my mac I'm trying to burn some CDs to play on my 1997 CD player but so far no luck\nI first burned mp3s on it and then I realized old CD players don't play mp3s\nThen I burned .wav files as an audio CD but I used DVD-R because I ran out of CD-R\nIt still won't work\nUsing Macbook Pro 2021\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is there a workaround?\n\nA: You will need to burn what is known as a \"Red Book CDDA\" CD. It doesn't really matter whether or not you understand that term, but that's a 'simple ordinary CD audio' disk.\nMany HiFi CD players were not capable of reading more advanced formats such as MP3 CDs or DVD. They simply don't know what they are.\nCD Audio is actually burned using AIFF files not WAV, but the difference between these two files types is actually so small that your computer will just adjust the format on the fly as it burns the CD, so you won't have to make any special preparation for that.\nAll you should need is your folder full of WAV files, numbered if you want a specific play order, as it will burn them alphabetically. Once burned the names are discarded, as CDDA contains no track information.\nSet your software to burn a CD Audio disk & use an actual CD, not a DVD.\nIf you're using iTunes/Apple Music, then set up like this…\n\nNote the burn speed is set very low. This is an old trick to get better results on older CD players with less tolerance of burn errors. A 2-second gap was the old default standard for audio CDs. you can set this how you wish.\nI've not done this in a long time, but I think iTunes will up-convert on the fly even if your input tracks are AAC or MP3, so it will automatically handle any format as it burns the CD, so long as you set it as above.\nUsing Sound Check is up to you [to balance the audio levels between tracks], but don't use CD Text if you want playback on such an old player.\n\nA: It was / is common that CDs or DVDs would work in some drives and not others.\nThis was mainly down to the tolerances of head position etc. one drive at the max and the other at the min.\nFirst test is does the CD or DVD work in the drive that wrote it? If it does then the data format etc is fine.\nThen test the CD in other drives, if it works there then it is down to the tolerances.\nI have 3 drives capable of writing CDs and 1 does not get used for writing for that reason.\n\nA: You should be able to burn mp3 files onto a CD. The burning process converts the audio into the AIFF format as it happens.\nWhat matters is the type of disk and the format that the disk is burnt with.\nA DVD disk won't work on a standard CD player.\n", "Q: Unknown App listed under general settings, but not visible in the App Library I tried to install an app from Safari which didn’t get installed unfortunately, but now there’s an unknown app listed under background app refresh settings with the following name, “Web” but it’s nowhere to be found in the App Library, I have already tried resetting the iPad but no results.\nHow can I remove this unknown app without having to hard reset my iPad?\nRunning iPadOS 16.1\n\n\nA: Web clips and apps that are side loaded can get in this state.\nYou will need to exclude them from backup (in case you want to restore from backup after the next step) and then erase all content and setting from the settings app to clean this remnant of an app.\nDisabling all entitlements effectively prevents them from running so you’ve done that. The only other way would be to reinstall an app with the same identity and then remove it cleanly.\n", "Q: Mapping Control+Command+Eject on non-apple keyboard How would I map different key combinations using Eject, such as Control+Command+Eject that restarts computer, when using non-Apple keyboard?\n\nA: The Eject key combinations are pretty much hardwired into the Mac, there's no way to swap the key without perhaps [untested] using something like Karabiner-Elements\nWhat you can do quite easily is map any key combo of your choice to the Restart or Shut Down menu commands, with one slight caveat.\n\nNote here we have a key combo for Shut Down… with the ellipsis that normally appears in the menu.\nThe slight oddity is that once you add this as a key commend, it works perfectly well, but the Mac automatically adds another Shut Down command to the menu bar, without the ellipsis. I don't know why it does this. It also does it to Restart… if you set a key command for that too.\nThis does mean that if you want it to shut down or restart without the dialog, you have to add a second command to the new menu item.\n\n", "Q: Revert to last saved, now that saving has been obsoleted Now that more and more document based applications do the  modern \"save, duplicate, revert to\" Versions thing instead of the traditional \"save, save as, revert\".\nHaving had 30 years becoming quite adept at the traditional workflow, I'm having trouble adapting.\nFor example, often I'll open a file like a spreadsheet, hide a few columns, paginate in landscape orientation, print, and then click the close button expecting that the file on disk wont have changed. But it has...\nSo how do I revert to the version of the file you opened before?\nPS: I assume this answer to its 10 year old question is sarcastic, awaiting something a bit more sensible.\n\nA: Apple have made a few modifications to the behaviour in the last 13 years: there are now options in System Preferences > General about whether apps ask to keep changes when closing a document; and also whether the documents will 're-spawn' when the app is restarted.\n\nChecking the first of these options will protect you from the worst effects of your ingrained behaviour. In both the situations you describe, you'll be asked if you want to keep your changes.\n\n*\n\n*File > Revert To.. will show you previously saved version of your document, so you should be able to restore the changes you made. You will also have your Time Machine backup, in extremis.\n\n\n*I'll agree that the 'new' document method doesn't suit Preview, because you often want to keep the original photo after making modifications, rather than only wanting a 'latest/current' document.\nFor that reason (and others) I'd recommend using a different image viewer or editor instead of Preview. Perhaps do your editing in something like Affinity Photo, and just use Preview for viewing.\nHowever, it shouldn't really take long to become accustomed to the new paradigm. Don't think of an open window as a temporary thing, but a permanent thing.\n", "Q: Block Gallery View in Finder on macOS macOS seems to have a fairly serious security issue that allows users to browse the Internet without any restrictions, even with device control software installed.\nChrome allows you to save any website to your desktop and preview it in Gallery View through the viewfinder.\nBelow is the process:\n\n*\n\n*Go to any website on Chrome, website is blocked at this stage by filter\n\n*Save As (Web Page, HTML Only)\n\n*In Finder, go to Gallery View and the website loads all text and images, CSS etc.\n\nCan the gallery view in Finder, be permanently blocked?

I want this to work with no WiFi or ethernet and basically, be retrying until one of those connections is up and running.\nThe problem is that \"do shell script\" returns an error of unknown host if there's no network connection and breaks my script.\nHere's my starting point script:\nset ping to do shell script \"ping -c 2 -q google.com\"\n\nrepeat until ping contains \"2 packets received\"\n   \n   delay 1\n   \nend repeat\ndisplay dialog \"Connection Successful.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n\nI've tried adding \"try\" commands and \"repeat until\" commands but nothing will get around that error.\nANY help is much appreciated!\n\nA: The first problem is that you're running the ping test once at the beginning, storing the result, and then just checking that same result over and over. But it's a stored result, so it's never going to change unless you re-run the test.\nSecond, you do need a try block to catch errors from the ping command. In fact, you don't really need to store the result at all, just use the fact that if the ping fails, it'll skip the rest of the try section. Something like this:\nrepeat\n    try\n        do shell script \"ping -c 2 -q www.google.com\"\n        exit repeat\n    on error\n        delay 1\n    end try\nend repeat\ndisplay dialog \"Connection Successful.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n\n...so if the ping succeeds, it'll run the exit repeat command. If it doesn't, it runs the on error section instead, which delays a second (and doesn't exit the repeat, so the loop will run again).\n[EDIT] If you want it to time out after a 10 seconds, you can record the start time at the beginning, then each time that the ping fails check whether it's been more than 10 seconds and display the failure message if to. The other thing that needs changing is that since the \"Connection Successful.\" message should only be displayed if it succeeded, not if it exited the loop because of timeout, that message needs to be moved into the \"success\" condition inside the loop:\nset startTime to (current date)\nrepeat\n    try\n        do shell script \"ping -c 2 -q www.google.com\"\n        display dialog \"Connection Successful.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n        exit repeat\n    on error\n        if ((current date) - startTime) > 10 then\n            display dialog \"Connection timed out.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n            exit repeat\n        else\n            delay 1\n        end if\n    end try\nend repeat\n\n(Note: it might be tempting to use repeat while ((current date) - startTime) > 10, but that makes it harder to tell if the loop exited because of success or a timeout. IMO it's simpler to include the detect-finished-condition + display-message + exit-loop stuff as blocks inside the loop.)\n\nA: I'm coming into this a little late, but I read how eager you are to learn AppleScript and the like, so I thought you might like to see an approach to your problem that is solved purely with AppleScript.\nThe problem as you stated it was a need to determine if a remote host is reachable, which I presume is a means of determining whether or not your machine has access to the internet.  In your example, you've established this by ping'ing google.com.\nInstead of pinging an host, it's sufficient just to see whether its host name resolves.\nThe technical jargon: A host name is the readable, canonical form that a remote host goes by (such as \"google.com\"), but in order to connect to it, it first needs to be transformed (resolved) into an IP address (such as 142.250.187.195), which provides a machine with the location of the host on the internet.  This is referred to as host name resolution or domain name resolution, and is performed by a domain name server.\nIf a remote hostname successfully resolves, then you have access to the internet, and very likely, your script can continue onward.  The benefit of this method compared with a ping is that the ping relies on the the remote host being up-and-running and connected to the internet (of course, Google probably hasn't disconnected since the 90s); and it requires that the host being pinged chooses to reply to the ping (they aren't obliged to).  DNS resolution will occur regardless of whether the host is currently responding, and it's a necessary action that must occur for your machine to be able to access the internet.  If it fails, then it's likely you won't be able to access any website, which in your case sounds like a reasonable test to determine whether any of your ethernet connections are active.\nAnyway, here's the AppleScript handler:\non hostIsReachable at address as {record, text}\n        tell (the address as {URL, anything}) to if ¬\n                    (string ≠ its class) then tell ¬\n                    the host to set the address to ¬\n                    the DNS form\n    \n        tell (\"mailto:\" & the address) as URL to tell ¬\n                    host & {dotted decimal form:stop} ¬\n                    to its dotted decimal form ≠ stop\nend hostIsReachable\n\nYou can paste this at the start or end of your script where you may have other handlers lurking already.  The handler can be invoked whenever you need to use it like so:\nhostIsReachable at \"https://www.google.com\" --> true\n\nor:\nhostIsReachable at \"google.com\" --> true\n\nor:\nhostIsReachable at \"google\" --> true\n\nIt returns true if the host name or URL you supplied is one that would be expected to resolve and you have an active internet connection for the resolution to take place; it returns false otherwise.  So, this:\nhostIsReachable at \"asdfghjkl.com\" --> false\n\nwill return false because that domain name is not registered on the internet.  Additionally, using an IP address will always return true, which makes sense if you consider that the nature of the test is to determine whether we get an IP address back after feeding it some data—if that data is already an IP address, then there's not a whole lot of resolution left to do.\nYou can slot this test into a loop for polling:\nrepeat 20 times -- 20 × 0.5-second delays = 10 seconds\n        set connected to hostIsReachable at \"google.com\"\n        if connected then exit repeat\n        delay 0.5 -- (in seconds)\nend repeat\n\nif not connected then error \"Timeout waiting for connection.\"\n            .\n            .\n            .\n(* rest of your script *)\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to move Quick Action from the separate tab directly to Context Menu? I am using macOS Monterey 12.4.\nI've created a Quick Action and it appears in the \"Quick Actions\" tab inside Context Menu.\nIs it possible to move it to the main Context Menu somehow? As specified in screenshot:\n\nI've tried to enable this action in \"System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services\" but it does not help. The Action is still in Quick Actions tab.\nAlso, I do not want to move all the Quick Actions to the main Context Menu but only the particular one.\nAre there any ways to do it?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Like you I find it annoying that Quick Actions can't be placed at the top level in the Finder context menu.\nTo put items in the context menu below \"Quick Actions\" requires a Finder Extension. You may be familiar with Finder Extensions added as part of an application. As well as extensions added by cloud synchronisation apps (e.g. Dropbox), I have  Finder Extensions that came with apps like Graphic Converter, Keka, HoudahSpot, and others.\nIf your development skills are better than mine, you could write your own Finder Extension. But I suspect your skills are not (otherwise you would not be asking this question). But there is one app which will assist.\nSearch in the Apple Store for \"finder extension\" and it will list a few finder extensions (and annoyingly some that are Safari extensions). I use Context Menu (New File Menu is a subset of it) and Service Station.\nService Station provides what you need. It can be configured to add two sorts of item to the context menu below Quick Actions:\n\n*\n\n*Applications. This is just an easy way avoiding the \"Open with\" submenu.\n\n\n*Scripts. This is what you need to create something similar to your Quick Action.\nThere is an outline of using scripts here: Scripts from Finder. But note that the screenshots have not been updated for Monterey - the added items should be between \"Quick Actions\" and \"Services\".\nHere is my Context Menu for an html document:\n\nYou can see 3 applications which I might want to use to open the file plus one script - Metadata.\nMy Metadata is just a simple bash script which runs mdls for the file and opens the result in a Text Edit window.  Nothing clever!\nYou can create scripts and workflows of your own, put them in ~/Library/Application Scripts/com.knurling.ServiceStation.Attendant and add to the Context Menu.\nMy only hesitation in recommending Service Station is that it has not been updated for over a year and the developer does not respond to his support page. But it is a really handy little utility.\n\nA: If the Quick Action was created in Automator, the following command (which edits the Workflow's Info.plist to remove the NSIconName property) makes the action show up in the main contextual menu instead of the Quick Actions submenu (at least in macOS Venture 13.1):\nplutil -remove NSServices.0.NSIconName /path/to/action.workflow/Contents/Info.plist\n\n(I do not know why this works, but discovered it because some older Quick Actions appeared in the main menu and some newer ones did not; upon investigation, the former had no NSIconName property but the latter did.)\n", "Q: Can't set up time machine with 500G drive and 1TB samsung T7 I erased the external drive (1TB samsung T7) and formatted with APFS (journaled). It backs up the first 220G of 480G or so. Then, it stops abruptly, complaining it has only 99M available. I'm not sure how this is possible, since my backup drive has 1T of space. What could be the problem?\n(My OS version is 11.5.2. I want to get a proper backup before updating.)\nUpdate: when I excluded Dropbox, it worked. The fact that I only have 40G of space on my hard drive probably adds to the problems.\n\nA: TM is not complaining about only 99MB left on the backup disk, but about the Macintosh HD not having free space. It needs quite a bit to work with for snapshots etc.\nIn addition, as the other commenters have suggested, if you have Dropbox syncing stuff back, then that just adds to the problem. Also, check your Bin for anything else you can get rid of to free up space.\nI had exactly the same issue the other day (except no Dropbox) on my 1TB MBP using TM to a barely half way full 2TB Samsung T7. Turns out I had a load of stuff in the Bin I'd forgot about, which left very little free space on Macintosh HD.\n", "Q: Can't Find Safari History File (Time Machine) I am trying to restore my Safari history and saved passwords from a Time Machine backup on Mojave.\nThe history.db file, according to Apple's website, is supposed to be at ~Library/Safari.\nHowever, that directory is not there. Where is it hiding?\nEdit: I wonder if I did a complete restore from Time Machine (through Migration Assistant?) if everything would be restored.\n\nA: You need to start Safari at least once to get the history database in ~/Library/Safari/History.db.\nYou'll find it in the same place in your TimeMachine backup.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2021: how to make globe key act like old FN (toggle between special and f-keys)? I'm upgrading from an old 2015 MBP (no touchbar) to a new 2021 MBP running Monterey 12.5.\nOn my old MBP, pressing fn key would toggle the top row from their default state (brightness, sound controls) to working like F1, F2, F3, etc.\nHow do I make the new MBP do this?\n\nIf I leave check \"Use F1, F2, etc...\" then the top row is function keys by default.  If I leave it unchecked, then the globe/fn key doesn't do anything.\nThere is no option under \"Press [globe] to...\" for activate function keys!\nFWIW, I don't use emojis, multiple inputs, or any of the other stuff the globe key is for - I use want to toggle f-keys.\nAnyone figured out how to do this?\n\nA: The Globe/Fn button acts exactly how it should, no matter what 'Press Globe to' is assigned to.\nTest it set to Emoji & Symbols, with F1, F2 unchecked…\nPress/release just the Globe, the Character picker opens.\nPress Globe & F3 together, Mission Control opens.\nPress just F3 & it will probably just beep, unless you have a specific function set up.\n", "Q: My Mac suddenly ran out of space All of the sudden my 2013 iMac on Catalina ran out of space. Last time I checked (last week), I'd about 400GB of space on my 1TB hard drive. Now the computer starts really slow and then it says I've -43Mb (yes, with a minus sign).\nI think the problem is related to an update (I forgot to disable updates, every update is a mess). I'd Time Machine, but my wife had to back up her Windows computer in an emergency, so I lent her my external hard drive. When the update ran, there was no external hard drive connected, and last week I saw some messages about Time Machine errors (I don't remember where, though, because I freaked out and tried everything I could ).\nAnyway, I deleted a lot of files, and I mean at least 100 GB. Still the same problem. Also, when I use the System Information and then Space Administrator (maybe that's not the right name, I translate from Spanish, but it's the option Cmd+U), the Documents / Large Files option is empty, although it's 177.48 GB.\n\nI'm going crazy and really don't know what to do. I've tried the software mentioned in \"System\" storage on macOS Sierra is 470GB! to no avail, because what I delete doesn't really get deleted, it just disappears.\nI'm watching closely and I see it's creating files (or something) at a 30MB/s rate. So I deleted almost 2GB and a couple minutes later I ran out of space. So it seems there's some process or soemthing that's causing this behavior\nDoes anyone have any idea what I can do or how I can find (and delete) these \"ghost\" files?\n\nA: First of all, try disabling Time Machine, and erasing snapshots from your system.\nOpen the terminal, and type the following:\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots \n\nsudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots (Date on these snapshots)\n\nNext step, clean the cache:\n~/Library/Caches\n\nIf there is still not enough space - install BuhoCleaner, select ToolKit ----> Disk Space Analyzer. It will show you the files that are taking up so much space.\n\nA: Thank you everybody for your help. I tried the suggested apps and other methods I have found online, but nothing worked and it got to a point it wouldn'even boot anymore. I took it to the service.\n\nA: are you using the 'photos' app? if so, have you checked the photos library? My friend had a similar issue, turns out his photos app was set to download full rez images to the drive and his library eventually was 800GB large.\nIf that is the case then go to photos -> preferences -> iCloud Tab and turn on 'optimization'. That should stop the library from 'growing'\n\n*\n\n*personally I wouldn't use the Photos app, since it puts everything in one 'container'. Sure you can check the package contents but finding a picture in there is basically impossible.\n\n", "Q: How to pass `option-c` to Hyper terminal rather than `ç`? I'm trying to get the fzf directory switcher to work in my terminal (Hyper).\nIt is supposed to work using option-c but in my case that just enters a cedille (ç).\nOne workaround I found is to use Esc-c instead.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: You need to use a “meta” or “alt” modifier, which Mac doesn't have natively. Hyper (like most Mac terminal emulators) can be configured to use the ⌥option or ⌘command key as a meta key. Open the configuration file (you can do this from Hyper with the “Hyper” > “Preferences” menu entry). There, look for the config: { … } block. If there isn't already one, add a nested modifierKeys block. To make ⌥option act as a meta modifier in Hyper instead of having its usual “alternative character” meaning, set the altIsMeta boolean option.\n\"use strict\";\n// Future versions of Hyper may add additional config options,\n// which will not automatically be merged into this file.\n// See https://hyper.is#cfg for all currently supported options.\nmodule.exports = {\n    config: {\n        modifierKeys: {\n            altIsMeta: true,\n        },\n        …\n    },\n    …\n};\n\nHyper has a bug whereby this doesn't work correctly for dead keys. For example, with a US keyboard, this makes ⌥+c equivalent to Esc c, but ⌥+e keeps its dead key function in addition to its Meta+E function, so ⌥+e a is equivalent to Meta+E and then inserting á.\n", "Q: AirPlay mechanism in Layman's language I am wondering how airplay works, e.g. I have this set-up:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro\n\n*Bose Home 300 Speaker (2.4GHz Wifi only)\n\n*Wifi modem-router 1 (Wifi5GHz)\n\n*Wifi router 2 (extended from 1 with an ethernet cable, Wifi2.4GHz)\n\n*apple-music subscription.\n\nIf the MBP is connected with Wifi5GHz and I play a song over AirPlay to the Bose Speaker, it works.

You're actually streaming the song so only small parts of the song are sent a time.\nNote also that nothing is actually stored on routers 1 and 2. They're forwarding smaller packets of data - they're not processing the data as such, nor are they storing it for later.\nFinally, you should note that your router are probably not (depending on your network configuration) even functioning as routers here. The data is sent from the MacBook Pro via WiFi to your \"Router 1\" (functioning as an access point), and then transferred via ethernet to \"Router 2\" (both device functioning as network switches) where it is again transferred via WiFi to your Bose speaker.\n", "Q: Which options would I have to recover files from a dead MacBook (2022) What would be the steps to take to recover data from a M2 Macbook Pro (or any Macbook where the hard drive is soldered and not removable), in case one day the laptop just doesn't switch on.\nI recently had this issue with a Windows laptop and I was immediately able to open the laptop up, pop the SSD into an enclosure, and access my data.\nWhat would be the equivalent steps to take if such a situation were to arise on my M2 Macbook Pro, if the laptop were to refuse to switch on?\nAlso what prior preparation can I do for such an eventuality (e.g. do not activate bitlocker encryption, have a second mac handy, etc.)?\n\nA: Make sure to have a recent backup, e.g. by enabling Time Machine to an external drive/SSD; and/or store data in iCloud or similar.\n", "Q: How to let local user access to ssh I have local user usr1 and root user in my mac. I can ssh using following command as a root user to a remote server but can't ssh using usr1.\nssh -i .ssh/pem1.pem ubuntu@server1\n\nI know since the permission for pem1.pem is 600 so only root has access to it and can access it but if I have to ssh to the remote server via usr1 and if I change the permission to 666 or 777 then it gives me the permission is not corrrect for the pem file. Is there any way to get around this situation?\n\nA: Each user needs to have a copy of pem1.pem in their respective ~/.ssh directory, set to 0600 and owned by them.\nSo, assuming you are logged in as root, run\nmkdir -p ~usr1/.ssh\ncp ~/.ssh/pem1.pem ~usr1/.ssh/\nchmod 600 ~usr1/.ssh/pem1.pem\nchown usr1:staff ~usr1/.ssh/pem1.pem ~usr1/.ssh\nchmod 700 ~usr1/.ssh\n\nDepending on the target system you are logging into it may be more useful (and secure) to use different credentials for each user.\n", "Q: Why are there two versions of Python 3 (3.9 and 3.10) on my MacOS Monterey system?

On macOS Monterey, v. 12.5, MacBook Air M1, 2020, and the latest version of Word for Mac (v. 16.64 (22081401), you have two options.\nIf your .pdf is text based, and the God's pity you, you'll have no issue converting the document into text. But what half decent lawyer wants to do that when having to assert to the authenticity of an exhibit, right?\nSo you're going to need the actual pages of the document. You can easily insert (secondary click > insert picture > boom!) a .pdf no matter how many pages it has, in fact, when the file choosing window comes up, you even get to use the left-right arrows to have a glimpse of the page of the .pdf. But for what end!? Because even when you turn the pages to one you wanted, but the first page, it will still enter, but the very first page.\nIn that very window, there is a button labeled \"Option\", and there is something alluding to some \"range[s]\", but even there you cannot define which one or more pages you needed let alone ranges or pages and ranges you needed from a file. Íf you choose the file, it defaults to inserting page one.\nThe work around is 1. separating the .pdf into (at times hundreds) of individual files, and pumping them into Word one by one. This is laborious and wasting ridiculous amounts of times in bigger litigations of costly billable hours even if you had the privilege to have paralegals do it for you as a fresh out the bar sole practitioner.\nSo, yeah, someone please help.\nIf nothing else, how can you batch insert all the pages of a .pdf even if you can't pre-specify which ones you needed (you can still then quickly select them with the mouse, and delete what you don't need)?\nBonus, how would it be possible, if at all, to select different non-continuous ranges of pages of a single file to squeeze in. (If you answered the first, that will probably green mark the answer with full satisfaction.)\n\nA: I don't think Word has the ability to insert or import multi-page PDFs.\nHowever, you can automate the process of splitting the PDF into single files; and a quick test shows that selecting several single-page files (with sequential filenames) and dropping them all on a Word document will place each one consecutively into the document.\nThere are utilities that will automatically split pages of PDFs into separate files, each indexed by page number. These include apps like Adobe Acrobat, PDFPen Pro, PDFMaster (all paid-for); and PDFSam (free).\nThere is even a Split PDF action in Automator and Shortcuts.app that you could use to create a Quick Action in the Finder.\nThere are other scripting methods of splitting PDFs, but these involve installing additional command-line software, like GhostScript or python.\n", "Q: How to fix iTerm when it doesn’t respect a custom default shell in macOS?

I'm glad your transition has been easy.\nYes, all Mac apps exist as a 'bundle' - really a special folder whose contents are hidden. Any app that you install by dragging to the Applications folder can be copied and pasted to the Applications folder of any other Mac.\nHowever:\n\n*\n\n*apps bought on the Mac App Store are linked to your AppleID -- you may be asked to sign in to your account on the new Mac to use them, or to update them.\n\n\n*some third-party apps may have licence codes, seat-limited authorization etc.\nIf an app is installed not by dragging, but with an installer package (.pkg file), it likely does install or configure things in other places that are essential for it to work properly. You may want to archive these packages (though you can nearly always download them, or a newer version, again).\nAs for backups: I'd suggest using macOS's Time Machine feature for backups. This will backup everything except the OS itself: apps, configuration files, user data, etc, etc.\nTime Machine is easy to configure and easy to restore files from. So you don't have to worry about choosing what to backup and what not to backup.\nYou can import ('migrate') data from a Time Machine backup onto any new Mac you own in the future.\nHowever, if you want to copy apps and configuration data wholesale to multiple Macs, then there are tools for cloning and imaging the entire disk, or otherwise 'managing' devices, though these process are more complex than once they were, due to security.\n", "Q: Automation privacy preferences unavailable at random times I have this strange symptom in which all of the apps registered under the automation privacy & security preferences sometimes are non-existent after unlocking my MacBook. I have similar problems with SecureInput messing with keystroke-based utilities such as 1Password or Keyboard Maestro, and I'm guessing this relates to it because what happens is that I cannot run anything depending upon System Events. I must log out and back in again for the SecureInput issue to resolve, and I need to restart for the automation preferences to come back.\n\n\nI have an installation of macOS Monterey 12.5.1, which is almost new and fresh (a 100% clean installation), with no unique add-ons that could mess with the system in such a manner, so I am not 100% convinced that my apps should be the problem, rather than the system messing up since I have had the same issues in my previous installation.\nConcerning SecureInput getting \"stuck\", it is this app and path that is the culprit:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/loginwindow.app/Contents/MacOS/loginwindow console\nSeems to be related to this post.\nI have yet to figure out what app or process causes the Automation preferences to disappear temporarily.\nAny thoughts regarding this could be helpful since it is pretty annoying.\n\nA: The easiest way I know to check whether this is enabled is to open the utility Terminal.app and check / toggle it in the Terminal menu\n\nChasing down which program \"left it on\" is a bit more tricky since they send a message to the loginwindow process to enable and disable this and I haven't found a log entry to punish the guilty parties.\nHere's an answer with a one line script I wrote that lets you know if it's on or off if you need that programmatically instead of visually.\n", "Q: Key Chain three set of public/private keys In Key Chain Access, I can see I have 3 sets of private/public keys, I suspect they are actually the same one set.\nCan I find out somehow? Is it possible that Key Chain somehow got to store duplicates?\nI know I have one key pair used for Github, that's it, no idea if the 2 remaining sets are identical or different and for what are they used for.\n\nA: Yes, you can find out by comparing the fingerprints of the keys.\nIn Keychain Access, click the \">\" icon to the left of the key you want to examine to bring out the certificate. Double-click the certificate to open up the detailed information. Scroll to the very bottom and you'll find the fingerprint of the key.\nCompare the fingerprint of the three keys - if they have different fingerprints, they're not duplicates.\n", "Q: Activating iOS Developer mode on 15.6.1 I'm trying to activate Developer mode on my iOS 15.6.1 device.

Opening Privacy and scrolling to the bottom of the list, there's supposed to be a Developer Mode toggle. That, too, does not exist.\nHow do I activate Developer mode for this version of iOS?

This is only possible to do on iOS 16 and onwards.\n", "Q: Put iMac display to sleep using Magic Keyboard with Lock Key I've just upgraded to the 2021 Magic Keyboard with Lock Key (A2450).

I need to collect photos from all my friends, some of whom use iPhone. (I have no Apple devices btw). Usually, I send people a link using which they upload all their photos to my cloud through a web browser, but iPhone removes all metadata from the photos, including date and time taken and GPS location, making a huge mess in the photo collection.\nIs there any way they could send me their photos in full quality and without losing EXIF metadata. I needs to be simple enough so that iPhone users would actually be willing to send me their photos from an event.\n\nA: If you're in their presence doing an Airdrop the files to one another. It's a pretty surefire way to get the file transferred and retain all the metadata. The file attributes can carry over too, but I've had somewhat inconsistent results with the OS file attributes at times when Airdrop has a snafu.

Having had 30 years becoming quite adept at the traditional workflow across many systems, I'm having trouble adapting.\nIn those applications using Versions, how do you save changes you've made to a document as a new file? For example, often I'll open a photo in Preview, crop it, resize it and then want to save it as a \"cropped\" version of the original file. Or I'll open a letter in Pages, change some details and decide I want to keep this version for a different recipient. Or open two videos in Quicktime Player, crop them both, concatenate one with the other and save the result as a new file.\nIt may be that that's simply not an option now, so I'm also interested in answers that describe a different workflow, that involves editing a file and somehow results in having the edits appear as a new file, leaving the original untouched. The same workflow for Versions and non-Versions applications would be great, or otherwise some good way of switching routines at the right time.\nThe related question of how to discard those changes in progress and revert to the last saved file has a useful answer, for now, here. And I assume the answer to this 10 year old question is sarcastic, awaiting something a bit more sensible.\n\nA: For your Preview scenario, I would open up the Photo, select File > Duplicate, give it a new file name, and then do the crop, resize and save.\nIf you do the crop and resize and only then realize that you wanted to save it under a new name, then you can hit File > Duplicate at that point to save it under a new name. Go back to the original window and select File > Revert To > Last Opened.\n", "Q: Chrome reroutes me automatically to servisepagefind.com and Bing without my consent -- how to stop it?

When presenting slides as a speaker at a conference, I use a Logitech Wireless Presenter Remote (link). Other speakers often come up to ask whether they can borrow the remote to advance slides on their laptops. Because this device plugs into a USB on my machine, I'm concerned that it might be a bad security practice to share this remote with other people. At the same time, however, I believe that any hardware vulnerability here may be relatively unlikely. Which is the case?\n\nA: It depends on how much trust you have in the people you're lending it out to, if you have the device in view at all times, and how likely it is that you're being targeted by someone with the means to perform such a hack.\nEssentially if you're handed an \"unknown\" USB device (of any type) to plug-in to your computer, and you do not know where it came from, you should be suspicious of it. I.e. don't pick up USB pen-drives that you found on the ground and plug it into your computer.\nFor your scneario: In order to exploit your computer, the malicious person would need to borrow your clicker device, take it somewhere you cannot see it, modify it (the hardware) to include the exploit, and then give it back to you.\nUnless you're giving talks at DEF CON or somewhere similar, where you can expect someone is trying to actively hack you, or you have some very valuable information on your laptop, I don't think this type of attack is something the ordinary person needs to worry much about (assuming you know who the person you're lending the device to is).\n", "Q: Installing fresh copy of Monterey and using Icloud to recover I have 2015 Macbook Pro which was always regularly updated (currently has Big Sur). I would like to upgrade to Monterey, but not like it'a usually done. I want to erase whole drive and install fresh copy of Monterey. I have Monterey installer on a USB drive. I have found instructions which suggest I should backup with Time Machine but I don't have drive big enough for that. So my question would be, in case I erase whole drive, and install Monterey, can I just connect Mac back to my Icloud and it would pull all the data back to my Mac, or erasing whole drive will also erase all the stuff stored on my Icloud? Anyone has suggestion how to do it in order to make fresh install and pull Icloud data later on?\n\nA: Repeat after me:\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Drive is not a backup.\n\n\n*Files without a backup are waiting to be lost.\niCloud Drive does not make copies of your applications; system settings; user settings; or anything else like Fonts, audio and video files (not bought from Apple), etc, etc.\niCloud Drive synchronises whatever is on your computer. If you delete a file, iCD deletes that file, too.\nIt's likely that if you boot to Recovery, or an installer disk, then you could erase the internal drive without sync-ing that erasure to the cloud, because you're not logged in.\nBut, you should never perform any operation where there is a risk of losing your files (and by 'perform any operation', I mean 'use your computer') without one or more copies of your data on one or more separate physical devices.\nAlso: restoring large amounts of data from the cloud will be SLOW...... like, hours.\nAlso: the benefits of a 'fresh' OS install are over-rated. It's usually possible to tidy up an existing installation by deleting a few files in a few places, rather than deleting everything and putting most of it back.\n\nA: As @nohillside answered above, I logged out from my Apple ID. Booted from USB, formatted whole drive and then ran a fresh Monterey installation from the USB. Now I'm logged back with my Apple ID and Icloud is still being synced.

So the solution I've come up with (until I find a new studio) is to use an external harddrive as a \"sync-drive\", that I connect to my work computer at the office and can take with me and use to access and edit files on the go on my personal computer.\nTo do this I need to find a solution to continually sync the contents of my work mac to the harddrive while I'm working on it, and that can sync files from the harddrive to the work mac if I've been working on something on my personal computer. (I don't need to sync the files to my personal mac, just be able to access and edit them with the external harddrive connected.)\nI work with large images and video, so it needs to be able to sync while I work (or in 5/10min intervals like Backblaze), so I don't need to wait for it to sync when I leave my studio.\nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: Just store your work on the external drive only.\n\nA: You can use an app like Forklift to compare and sync folders on the drive, or merge work between your computers that you have copied to the drive:\n\nCompare local or remote source and target folders identifying matching, modified, new and deleted files. Synchronize them one or two-way with a single mouseclick, or save it as a favorite.

Can I?\nIs there some other CLI-friendly (terminal-based) way to add photos and videos to this database, so that they get quickly shared with all my devices, and uploaded to iCloud as well?\n\nA: Short answer, no.\nThe contents of the originals folder are your um.. originals, but they have been renamed to a UUID, and that UUID is registered in the database. The other folders contain other versions as Photos is doing its internal processing and producing derivatives for Moments etc...\nIf you attempt to just copy files in, they won't be recognised, and certainly won't be uploaded to iCloud Photos. At worst you will corrupt the database. The whole thing is enclosed in a package for good reason, to avoid casual fiddling. It doesn't deter the determined ofc..\nThe UI import process is quite robust, so why not use that instead?\nIndeed, perhaps you should question why you want to do this via CLI in the first place. What are you hoping to achieve by being different?\nNow, there are some very useful external CLI apps such as https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos which allow queries of the database, and a limited way of adding existing photos to albums, but it doesn't offer import.\n", "Q: Free alternatives to Smultron I was a long time user of Smultron.

A screenshot for example typically has a long file name and if I wanted to pass to ImageMagik or something, I figured this sort of file reference would be most efficient.\nI should mention I'd be willing to switch from zsh to bash if this were an option there.\n\nA: Files have no inherent ordering on the filesystem, though can be sorted\nby name, modification time, or so forth; with ZSH you can select by say\nthe most (or least) recently modified, if you can remember (or tab\ncomplete) on the single character flags involved:\n% mkdir test\n% cd test\n% touch a\n% touch b\n% touch c\n% print *(om[1])\nc\n% print *(Om[1])\na\n% touch aa\n% print *(om[1])\naa\n% touch aaa\n% print *(om[1])\naaa\n\nBy name is available but good luck counting to some file in the middle of the list (or maybe you're better at doing that math in your head than I am?):\n% print *(on[1])\na\n% print *(On[1])\nc\n% touch zzz\n% print *(On[1])\nzzz\n\nOther sorting options are available, though besides the first or last\nit's probably not very viable for selecting a random filename.

These snapshots can be viewed in Time Machine's Finder-esque UI just like the incremental backups to external media. So, you can use these Time Machine snapshots to view recent versions of your file system, say to retrieve an old file that was just deleted using rm(1).\nIt appears Time Machine will only automatically create local snapshots after it is configured to backup to external media. Is it possible to enable automatic APFS snapshots without enabling Time Machine backups to external media?\n\nA: I'll mention the workaround I've employed:\n\n*\n\n*Mount an external disk that I don't use anymore.\n\n*Set it up as the Time Machine disk.\n\n*Eject the disk, and never amount it again.\n\n*Profit.\n\nTime Machine automatically creates snapshots now. This solution was not my first choice since Time Machine will remind me to mount the external disk for backup, but I haven't received that notification yet.\n@At0mic mentioned in the comments that it might be possible to use a sparsebundle as the target disk, but that this needs to be done from the command line.

My goal is to be able to double click on a netCDF file on Finder and see the text output from a CLI command to which the filename is given.\nSpecifics: There is a command-line command that displays the table of contents of a netCDF file:\n$ ncdump -h yourfile.nc\n\nThis command shows the table of contents of the netCDF file to the current terminal.\nHow can I see the same output when I double click on the file on Finder?\nEdit: The following is a description of a failed approach.\nI have made some progress toward a solution.\nFollowing this thread\nHow to make a Mac OS X .app with a shell script?\nI've been able to create a macOS \"app\" which is actually a shell script:\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/local/bin/ncdump -h \"$@\"\n\nSo far, I've been able to verify that I can invoke this \"app\" from Finder and that the above shell script is actually run. But, I found that the shell script doesn't get the filename as a command line argument. (You can see what's going on by modifying the line to /usr/local/bin/ncdump -h \"$@\" > $HOME/tmp/logfile.txt 2>&1)\nSo, I have two specific questions\n\n*\n\n*How can a shell script (as app) get the filename when invoked from Finder?\n\n\n*To which GUI app should it send its stdout and how?\n\nA: If your App is actually just a shell script, you don't need the open command to run it. Just execute the shell script using ./PATH_TO_SCRIPT -- in your case, this would be ./MyApp.app/MyApp, if you followed the naming suggested in the linked thread.\nFrom there, you can redirect or pipe the output like with any other shell command.\nHowever, if you have to use the open command: There seems to be an argument --stdout, which could solve your problem. From man open:\n\n--stdout PATH\n    Launches the application with stdout connected to PATH.\n\n\nEdit\nThe edit of your question changes a lot: You want to start the Application/Script via Finder, but then see the \"Terminal Output\".\nYou could, for example, use AppleScript to show a notification or dialog containing the output of your app (depending on how much text it is).\nThis can be done using the osascript -e '[APPLESCRIPT_COMMANDS]' command. For example, osascript -e 'display dialog \"Sample Text\"' will show a small popup window containing \"Sample Text\" and Ok/Cancel buttons. More info on dialogs can be found for example here.\nFor this to work, you must redirect the output of the commands in your script to a variable, this can be done for example with myVariable=$(...original command...)\n\nA: Abandoning the idea of turning a shell script into an app, I adopted @JLubberger's idea of using an AppleScript. The best I have achieved so far is\non open filename\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        do script \"ncdump -h \" & quoted form of POSIX path of filename & \" 2>&1\"\n        activate\n    end tell\nend open\n\nand export this as an app.\nThen, open a netCDF file with this app, which will launch Terminal, which will show the output from the command \"ncdump -h filename\".\nOne unsatisfactory aspect to this solution is that Terminal shows extra ouptputs of its own.  I'd rather have a window which will just show the ouptput from the command. This would be a different approach because I would have to find a way to run the command from within the script and send its output to a GUI window. In contrast, the above script of mine asks Terminal both to run the command and to display its output.\n", "Q: Code with open cv in python in macos: process is launched in terminal but nothing happens I am trying to display an image using open cv and used the following code (from geeksforgeeks).

I’m using a MacBook Air (early 2015) and trying to do some 3D rendering however it’s an absolute pain to do it on the cpu and it’s probably not good for the laptop to run at those temperatures for that long anyway.\nI was thinking of getting an eGPU. The Apple website says that I need a MacBook with an intel processor and a thunderbolt 3 port. Mine doesn’t have the latter but I do think that USB to thunderbolt 3 adapters exist,  would an eGPU still work if I were to use an adapter like that?\nIs there nothing else I can do to speed up my rendering?\n\nA: No, because USB ≠ Thunderbolt (TB) 3. The USB specifications (unless its USB 4, which didn't exit in 2015) were always inferior to TB. In order to use an eGPU you need to transfer data at very high speeds. While TB 3 already supported up to 40Gbps the USB ports on your machine only allow 5Gbps. This is simply too little for an eGPU (apart from the fact that the protocol is also different...).\nThe only GPU hardware supported on macOS are Metal for Apple Silicon and AMD per your render engine of choice, cycles.\n\n*\n\n*https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.html\n\nMetal is supported on Apple computers with Apple Silicon or AMD graphics cards. macOS 12.2 is required to use Metal with Apple Silicon while macOS 12.3 is required to use Metal with AMD graphics cards.\n\n\nA: Is there nothing else I can do to speed up my rendering?\nShort of a new machine, no. 3D rendering is very hard work, and has always required top-of-the-line hardware. This is why desktop Mac Pros with dual GPUs exist. (I'm not saying you need to buy one of the insanely expensive ones, but companies are prepared to pay those prices because time is money.)\nA MacBook Air is designed and marketed for 'light-to-moderate' use; and the MacBook Pro name indicates more capable hardware for professional-level work, like video, software development and animation. An Air wasn't the right tool, even in 2015! ;-)\nIf you're doing this commercially, then I'd suggest investing in a new M1 Pro or Max MBP. The GPU capabilities of those Macs holds up well against current desktop GPUs, and the overall performance is absurdly fast.\nIf you're doing this as a hobby, and can't afford to spring for a new MBP, then I'm afraid you'll just have to let it run. It will get hot, but the fans are designed to cool things down, and the CPU will also slow down as it gets hotter; in extremis the CPU will shut itself off to prevent heat damage if things get out of control. However, you'll be 'pushing the envelope', and something might possible 'give', if you are doing this a lot.\nIn the old days, people would leave these sorts of tasks running overnight!\nOne more thing: Apple's laptops between 2015 and the current M1s are 'not great' for a variety of reasons, mostly involving heat, GPUs and bad keyboards, so I wouldn't buy a second-hand Mac laptop in that range either.\n\nA: Thunderbolt 3 is not strictly required for an eGPU to work.  The people that sell and support them will tell you Thunderbolt 3 is required because if used with Thunderbolt 2 it might not perform as quickly as expected.  To connect a Thunderbolt 3 device to a Thunderbolt 2 computer will require a Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter.  I have done this to connect a Thunderbolt 3 dock to a Thunderbolt 2 Mac and it works as intended, but the data throughput is limited to that of the Thunderbolt 2.  The Thunderbolt 3 adapter makes a physical connection possible, it doesn't make the connection faster.\nConnecting a Thunderbolt device to a USB port is not likely to work.  There's a protocol difference that would take drivers to fix, and I doubt anyone is going to write drivers.  Thunderbolt 2 and Thunderbolt 3 are essentially the same protocol so no special drivers needed, but Thunderbolt 2 is going to be half the speed of Thunderbolt 3.  Depending on the application and expectations using Thunderbolt 2 may work.\nThe issue of Apple silicon Macs not supporting eGPUs is also a matter of drivers.  There's no inherent reason any eGPU can't work with Apple silicon, it is just that nobody has written drivers yet.  I've seen on Linus Tech Tips where they experimented with an Ethernet based eGPU and got that to work with Apple silicon Macs.  Why an Ethernet connection to an eGPU works but not one by Thunderbolt gets complicated really quick.  I'm a bit surprised it worked but after some thought I can see why it does.\nA Thunderbolt 3 based eGPU should work fine on Thunderbolt 2 with an adapter, for some definition of \"fine\".  If I'm mistaken on your model of MacBook having a Thunderbolt port then that's not an option.  Ethernet based eGPUs are an option if the software supports that, and like with Thunderbolt 2 vs. Thunderbolt 3 there's going to be a performance bottleneck because Ethernet isn't as big of a data pipe.  There's really no easy way around the speed limits of the ports out of the computer, but you should be able to get the computer to talk to a GPU.  If this is worth the effort vs. just getting a new computer is up to you.\n", "Q: How to take screenshots on macOS without having to remember a bunch of key combinations?

You can find Screenshot in the Applications > Utilities folder.\nOnce started, the Screenshot app presents an overlay with a selection area and a toolbar with buttons to:\n\n*\n\n*Capture the screen, the current window, or the selected area.\n\n*Record the screen or the selected area as a movie.\n\nThere are also options like delaying the capture by 5 or 10 seconds, and where to save the file.\nFor more info, see macOS User Guide > Take screenshots or screen recordings on Mac.\n\nRemark: As it was mentioned in a now deleted comment, the macOS Spotlight search finds Screenshot.app even if the old application “Grab“ is used:\n\nFor those who are interested how this works: The Info.plist file of Screenshot.app has an MDItemKeywords\":\"Grab\" entry.\n\nA: I use Shottr which can be triggered by keyboard shortcuts and menulet entries. In addition to plain screenshot functionality, it also allows for some basic markup functionality (arrows, boxes, text).\n\nA: This is an alternative answer, however a quite expensive one: some keyboards made for Mac OS have a dedicated screenshot key. For instance, in this keyboard I'm using (Keychron K3), notice the key to the left of del:\n\nOne nice thing about that dedicated key is that it can be used with Control as well: pressing it alone is the equivalent of Shift + Command + 4, which takes the screenshot. However, I normally prefer Shift + Control + Command + 4, which copies the screenshot to the clipboard so I can use it on another application quickly, and that dedicated key also does this copy feature.\n\nA: Preview app\nAdditionally to the answers already provided, the built-in Preview.app lets you make screenshots under the \"File > Take Screenshot\" sub-menu.\n\n\nA: My solution might seem clumsy to some people, but it works for me!\nI have a hot corner - the lower left one, specifically - set to open Launchpad.\nThen, in Launchpad, the application in the bottom left corner of the first page is Screenshot.\nNow, I know Cmd+Shift+5 is the keyboard combination to bring up the dialogue box for Screenshot.app, but if I'm using the mouse for a task, it's much quicker to keep my hands on the mouse/trackpad and use my hot corner solution.\nI've also suggested my solution to a few people who have trouble remembering key combinations. Whilst none have come back to thank me for the solution, they haven't come back to ask me how to take a screenshot, either. Maybe it works for them, too.\n", "Q: How to open \"Login Items\" in \"System Settings\" programmatically in MacOS 13 - Ventura? I want to open \"Login Items\" of System Settings in MacOS Ventura(13.0) programatically.\nFor example, to open \"Notifications\", i can use the following\nurl:\nx-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.notifications\nProgrammatically opening login items is what I am looking for\n\nA: Two possible methods:\nMethod1: - Thanks to my boss at office (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice/4013547-opensystemsettingsloginitems)\n// Need Xcode 14 \n#import <ServiceManagement/ServiceManagement.h>\n\n[SMAppService openSystemSettingsLoginItems];\n\nMethod2: - Thanks @Martin R - Objective C version\n#import <Appkit/NSWorkspace.h> // Useful for command line application\n\nNSString *url = @\"x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.LoginItems-Settings.extension\";\n[[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:url]];\n\n[Note: Added my Method2 answer at the same time as @MartinR, without knowing he has answered, but still left it here for people who might be looking for an objective-C version]\n(Edit Looks like some of the existing links were not opening in Ventura when '''open''' is used, but '''NSWorkspace.shared.open()''' works well, the information is from here\n)\n\nA: open x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.LoginItems-Settings.extension\n\ndoes the trick on macOS Ventura. Found here, where more System Preference pane URLs and paths are collected.\n\nA: For me, the solution provided by @MartinR yields a syntax error.\nWhile looking for a way to fix this, I stumbled upon this solution. The AppleScript on the following format:\nuse AppleScript version \"2.4\" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse framework \"AppKit\"\nuse scripting additions\n\ncurrent application's NSWorkspace's sharedWorkspace()'s openURL:(current application's NSURL's URLWithString:\"x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.LoginItems-Settings.extension\")\n\nseems to do the trick.\nAdditionally, if one wants to find all the possible preference panes in the new System Settings in macOS Ventura, these are listed in the following file:\n/System/Applications/System Settings.app/Contents/Resources/Sidebar.plist\nas found here.\n", "Q: How to get Apple Music link with automation on macOS?

My 14 inch macbook with the m1 max chip has lost 10% of its battery capacity in 8 months of usage. Is this normal? I've also been using my iPhone pro max for about the same time and it only lost 1% of battery capacity.\nIs this normal at all, or could this be because my macbook is always plugged in?\nP.S. I do have the optimized battery charging turn on:\n\nHere's the cycle count and the capacity:\n\n\nA: That’s totally normal - especially if you use the machine a lot.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/support/products/mac/\nYou can get battery service if it falls under 80% while in coverage like AppleCare. You’ve got the correct settings and as long as you keep it cool while charging you should be fine.

As you can see it becomes almost impossible to read the time. I have my device set to auto switch between dark and light mode, so it's always dark mode when this occurs, and it's impossible to read the date/time. I've included light mode screenshots just to show the effect better.\nDark Mode, sleep focus not active:\n\nDark Mode, sleep focus active:\n\nLight mode, sleep focus not active:\n\nLight mode, sleep focus active:\n\nDoes anyone know what might be causing this, or what I might be able to do to stop this, without disabling the sleep focus?\n\nA: Dimming indicates that Focus is active.\nIf you don't like dimming as visual clue of Focus then you should go to Dock & Menu Bar in Preferences. On left pane select 'Focus' and tick 'Show in menu bar' (it should not matter whether status is 'when active' or 'always').\nBy doing this tilted half-moon icon will be displayed on Status menu if Focus is active (or always if set so) and date/time will not be dimmed.\n\nA: The first thing I would do is reduce transparency in the accessibility controls.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/lv-lv/guide/mac-help/unac089/mac\nNext I would increase contrast.\nIf both don’t work, you might need to choose a different background or set one mode for dark or light and optimize for that setting all the time.\n", "Q: Deeper sleep when closing lid of MacBook Pro? I have a mid-2015 MacBook Pro (Monterey 12.5.1), and the battery is quite badly degraded, despite being replaced once. I can only just get 30-40 minutes of use from a fully charged battery. This isn't so much a problem, as I rarely use the device without a power source, however I'm finding when I shut the lid of the device at night with a 100% charge, by the following day when I return to the device, the battery will have drained to < 10% and the device powers off, as can be seen in the image below.\n\nMy battery settings are shown below.\n\nIf I shut the device down at night, when I power it back up the following day, the battery has lost no more than a couple of percentage points of charge, so my question is, is it possible to have the Mac go in to a deeper sleep when the lid is shut?\n\nA: I’ve never been able to get hibernate to work in a way that was helpful, so if you can’t keep it alive by turning off Power Nap (which your screen shot shows is already off), you’ll have to shut it down, plug it in or replace the battery.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/lv-lv/guide/mac-help/mh40773/mac\n", "Q: TEMP files encrypted on IPhone? I am going to sell my iPhone soon and wondered as to the safety of the temp files/cache files on iPhone for apps like twitter,Reddit,WhatsApp ETC.\nI am aware that iPhone has File based encryption and was just curious as to whether that included the temp/cache files on the system?\n\nA: Apple has a support article about what to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch:\n\n*\n\n*Unpair Apple Watch\n\n*Log out of iCloud/iTunes Store\n\n*Deregister iMessage if this is your only/last Apple device\n\n*Erase device\n\nThis will ensure that all data on the device gets removed, and that the new owner can get access to it.\n", "Q: Is WindowsServer a part of OSX?

If you check carefully it’s “window server” with one S.\nWindowServer is a normal process, part of macOS (and OS X before the name change) and that watchdog indicates the system could not continue with a key instruction so it dumped internal state and forced a reboot.\nFixing these can go several ways\n\n*\n\n*reinstall the os\n\n*remove accessories\n\n*remove software and modifications\n\n*collect more data on when and how this happens\n\n\nA: Just wanna pipe in on what it is and say that, when my mac is sluggish, windowserver cpu usage often seems to be involved.\nHow to lower down WindowServer CPU usage on a Mac\n(disregard that blurb about using their products)\n\nWhat is WindowServer on Mac?\nSimply, it’s the macOS process that draws elements on the screen, whether they are application windows, icons, or websites. The more windows you have open at any one time, the more CPU cycles WindowServer needs. Most graphical elements are refreshed regularly, which is why WindowServer needs those CPU cycles. Every time you move a window around or edit an image in Photoshop, or switch to a different tab in Safari, WindowServer needs to redraw your screen.\nWhen you consider that windows in macOS have lots of effects, such as transparency and drop shadows, it’s hardly surprising that drawing and redrawing them on screen consumes resources. However, on most Macs, the number of CPU cycles WindowServer consumes should be so small you don’t notice it.\n\nI've never had it cause a shutdown, the T2 security chip fullfills that role, frequently, on my system instead.  But if it doesn't reoccur I wouldn't lose sleep over it.\n", "Q: Applescript. Choose from list and launch selection I have a script that asks for a folder first, then launches the files of that folder as a list, then I select the file, and then it launches it. But I want it to open the contents of a pre-specified folder as a list and then I select from the list and then for it to launch it.

I'm coming from Windows world where I can scale the UI and set it to, say, 125% to make the UI elements (mainly fonts) acceptable on my QHD screen (while keeping the screen resolution the same).\nI found out that on MacBook Pro I only can scale with the use of screen resolution change. Well, that's not what I want as the lower screen resolution (indeed resulting in larger UI elements) is not my display's native resolution and the screen gets blurry.\nIs there a way I can fix that problem? While I can make the browser's content larger by using the browser's zoom in option, I can't do the same with the UI elements.\n\nA: No, there's no way to do that.\nThe macOS UI is not resolution independent, nor does it support arbitrary DPI scaling. It supports a low DPI mode (standard, 1x) and a high DPI mode (\"retina\", 2x) - and that's basically it. The good thing is that those two settings seem to work well with every application.\nIn the Windows world, things are quite a bit different, as things have evolved and changed a lot over the years:\nWindows has traditionally had a DPI setting that allowed you to scale the user interface - but it is the programmer of each and every application that must support DPI scaling for it to actually work. Historically this had problems with high DPIs.\nOver time Windows APIs evolved, and now the way scaling works depends on how the programmer built the application. I.e. some ways it scales automatically according to the resolution and physical size of the monitor, in some ways it requires the application to manually scale and in some ways it doesn't scale at all. This allowed for fun times where some programs worked fine, and others were ridiculously oversized.\nFrom Windows 8 and on, things have become somewhat better in regards to scaling as Microsoft now allows developers to declare whether they have implemented scaling or not. This makes those oversize-issues go away - sometimes at the cost of clarity. However, you could still have funny things like moving a window from one monitor to another in a dual-monitor setup, and having the window suddenly appear to blow up in size.\nThings have massively improved with later versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11 though. Microsoft have adapted some of the same, simple measures that macOS uses for its high DPI mode, while allowing a lot of manual overrides and settings for users, so that they can make sure that they get the right scaling for each app no matter how the developer made the application.\n\nA: \"the lower screen resolution (indeed resulting in larger UI elements) is not my display's native resolution and the screen gets blurry.\"\nI think you misunderstand scaling on macOS.\nMac Laptops have a very high pixel density -- around 220-250 ppi. This inevitably makes objects very small on the screen.\nThe default scaling essentially 'pretends' to have a resolution of half the size, to allow a more comfortable size of objects, but at the same time using double the number of pixels, each of which can have a different shade.\nThis is really no different from 'zooming in' on a page.\nThe screen can only display images using the pixels it has.\nYou can scale the relative size of text and images on those pixels. A 2x scaling will give you the sharpest results, and that's the default and usually pretty good.\nUsing fractional scaling, e.g. 1.5x, might give you slightly less sharp results, but I wouldn't characterize them as 'blurry' normally.\n", "Q: Recovery mode first aid fails with \"resource busy\" on APFS partition My iMac 2012 with 1TB Fusion drive is giving me a lot of trouble. It hangs forever when booting up. So with the help of an external bootable USB (Catalina 10.15.7) I managed to boot into recovery mode and start disk utility. Unfortunately it says:\nRepairing file system \nVolume was successfully unmounted\nPerforming fsck_apfs -y -x /dev/rdisk5s5\nerror: device /dev/rdisk5 failed to open with error: resource busy\nFile System check exit code is 66.\nrestoring the original state found as mounted\nProblem -69842 occurred while restoring the original mount state\nFile system verify or repair failed. : (-69845)\n\nOperation failed\n\nAfterwards the Volume Macintosh HD is shown grey and cannot be activated anymore.\nI tried to copy some files from the disk to my external USB drive (HFS, journaled, case sensitive). This seemed to work however all the target files were empty. Running in verbose mode cp -npRv was complaining \"device not configured\". Is there anything I can do or try to make first aid run successfully and/or copy my files from this hard disk to my external USB drive?\n\nA: So I finally recovered most of my data but is was painful long experience. Here is what helped in the end:\nI don't know for sure exactly, but after another unsuccessful try to run first aid on my hard disk I tried to unmount/mount it manually using the terminal in recovery mode (booted from the external USB):\n$ diskutil unmount /dev/disk2    # this was successful\n$ diskutil mount /dev/disk2.     # this failed\n\nHowever after rebooting again into recovery mode suddenly first aid run through successfully. So don't give up too early. Sometimes rebooting seems to fix something. Maybe also my reseting of the nvram via terminal nvram -c helped. Maybe even using disk util in English instead of my mother language helped. I also realized one should always click on View -> Show All Devices in Disk Utility and also run first aid on the container. I tried to reboot and see if my Mac is booting again but it still hang. Since at that time it was very clear to me that I had some hardware issue with my drive and because I couldn't open the iMac I switched it off to cool down. I also turned it on its head and moved it a little bit in a desperate move in case it was a slightly loose cable or something like that. After that I rebooted into recovery mode (this time from internal hard disk).\nThen I tried copying my data using\ncp -npRv /Volumes/Macintosh HD/<important_dir> /Volumes/BACKUP_USB_APFS\n\nand it worked. To make sure my iMac would not sleep and the copy process would not stop I started in a separate terminal window\n$ caffeinate\n\nAnd to be absolutely sure I also configured the global power settings and switched of sleep and hard disk sleep\n$ pmset -a sleep 0\n$ pmset -a disksleep 0\n\nHowever the copy process was hanging/slow at several file (presumably because of bad blocks or some hard disk damage). But I realized I could speed up the process by starting the same copy process over and over in separate terminal windows. The option -n makes sure, that no file will be overwritten, that means no copy process will be done twice.\nAfter several hours (I ran it through the night) I finally had copied most of the data successfully to my external USB hard drive. Now to be very sure my multiple copy processes didn't mess up things I decided to run rsync in addition. rsync is coming with Mac OS X, but it is not in your path when working in recovery mode. So you have first switch to the /usr/bin directory before being able to use it. At first I did a dry run to see which file would be modified:\n$ cd /Volumes/Macintosh HD/usr/bin\n$ ./rsync -ai --exclude=\"._*\" --dry-run /Volumes/Macintosh HD/<important_dir> /Volumes/BACKUP_USB_APFS | grep \"^>\" >> /Volumes/BACKUP_USB_APFS/lost_data.txt\n\nThis will show all files which will be added by rsync (-i/--itemize option will show a > for each file rsync plans to modify, which we filter with grep). Here I discovered an interesting quirk of the version of rsync coming with Mac OS. When one is using the option -E rsync will not allow to exclude dot files, meaning --exclude=\"._*\" doesn't work. But for copying I used the -E option to make sure to get the extended attributes, which cp ignored.\n$ rsync -vaEP /Volumes/Macintosh HD/<important_dir> /Volumes/BACKUP_USB_APFS   \n\nIt should be noted that rsync is running much much slower than cp on a damaged hard disk. Especially when trying to copy huge files (movies) rsync takes a lot of time until it finally gives up. The whole process was running for 1,5 days. So I always recommend to first use cp and only afterwards use rsync.\nSo that is it. I managed to recover most of the data with that from my broken hard drive. But I do want to also mention a lot of things that didn't work:\n\n*\n\n*Apple Transfer mode (press T at boot time) didn't work. The destination laptop showed the drive of my broken iMac but then crashed quickly when trying to access it.\n\n*Apple Diagnostics (press D at boot time) didn't work. It only showed error -2002D. This was weird, because my Wifi worked even from recovery mode.\n\n*I tried to use Rclone, because in opposition to rsync and cp it is multi-threaded. You can install it in recovery mode by downloading it with curl curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.59.1/rclone-v1.59.1-osx-amd64.zip, unzipping the file with \\usr\\bin\\unzip and just start the executable. However it turned out to be even slower than rsync in my case.\n\n*I tried using Disk Drill in recovery mode as described here. However the copy process simply stopped, because the hard drive \"vanished\" during the process. Somehow it got unmounted. That happened several times so I gave up on it. Also DiskDrill by default doesn't copy hidden files (you have to find the menu point to activate this first) and seems to not copy all meta data correctly.\n\n*Creating a bootable USB drive failed at first. I tried downloading the Catalina installer (on another laptop) from App Store as described by Apple. But the download failed with an error. So I tried to download it via commandline, but it also failed with a weird error. The only thing that worked in the end was using mist-cli. Here is how to create a bootable USB drive on command line quickly with mist-cli\n\nDo this:\n$ brew install mist\n$ mist list installer\n$ sudo mist download installer 10.15.7 application\n$ sudo /Users/Shared/Mist/Install\\ macOS\\ Catalina.app\\ 10.15-19H15.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/<MyUSBDrive>\n\n", "Q: How do I install grpcio on m1 Mac?

I'm trying to logic what the role of 802.1x profiles are. Does the below make sense?\n802.11 is a standard for wireless networks with various physical layers and the standard for campus wifi. When an AP sends a connection response to a device, it also sends an authentication framework or profile that the device can use to continue authenticating so that it can connect. We can refer to this framework as a 802.1x profile. 802.1X runs over 802.11 which authenticates mobile stations to the access point by checking the user's identity. The user's identity is determined based on their credentials. When you set up a network, it stores or caches a configuration profile on your device that authenticates via a central authority. You can see the configuration profiles (Wi-Fi or otherwise) that your laptop uses in Settings/System Preferences. Now, when you connect, your device is communicating the profile info to the AP and the AP can confirm it. \nSo when authentication goes wrong with the user's credentials, it might be that the access point and the device have two different versions of the profile and the device one is outdated or incorrect. So a common troubleshooting technique is to delete and essentially force refresh the profiles, making your device to redo the configuration. It may also help to delete stored information about your credentials (in Keychain access) for similar reasoning! \n\nA: 802.11X is a standard for extendible authentication over 802.11 (aka Wi-Fi). This can be in many forms, for example, it may use a username and password, or something more complex like issuing certificates to each device.\nBecause 802.11X encapsulates things like certificate-based authentication, which cannot be manually entered, macOS allows you to install configuration profiles which pre-configure how the computer will authenticate with the network. However, this is not required to use 802.11X: if it is username/password based, you can manually type them in if desired.\n", "Q: How to prevent multiple device backups in iTunes I was snooping around iTunes recently and navigated to the Devices Preferences tab and found 3 backups in the Devices backups list. I never realized when I would get new devices through the years and would do the Restore from Backup thing from a local backup that I was apparently creating a new backup during that operation. I always assumed I was merging backups into a new phone but now that I look it appears that I must have been taking an existing backup, loading it onto the new device, and splitting off a new backup offshoot for that new device while the old backups then sat around waiting for those old devices to connect or something.\n\nI can even see the three distinct folders dedicated to these three backups on the file system. The current one interestingly enough takes a different GUID form than the older two which seem related to each other in that there's a suffix used to differentiate the two.\n\nIs this understanding expressed above accurate? Is this how the multi device backups work and are generated? Is it even possible to restore a new device from an old backup that belonged to a different device? Is the checkbox option Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically responsible for this split backup behavior? Maybe it's just a fallacious premise to think that multiple devices could even share the same backup and merge their data all together in one big enchilada on disk.\n(My memory could be off on this one since I didn't monitor the operation closely when I setup my new phone last Christmas. It could be there's old files and folders that didn't wind up in my new device which would suggest I did not restore from an old backup file but from other material found on my PC and my iCloud account. I did find my contacts and probably my iCloud photo instances present so assumed everything else restored from those old backups but now I'm not so sure.)\n\nA: \nIs it even possible to restore a new device from an old backup that belonged to a different device?\n\nYes, you can load a new device with a backup of any older device.\nHowever, no - you cannot backup two devices to the same folder. Those devices would have conflicting settings and data. The system cannot magically merge two devices into one backup. Imagine if you had a setting \"on\" on one device and \"off\" on another, for example.\nWhen you restore a backup onto a new device, further backups of that device are recorded separately, not modifying the old devices backups.\n", "Q: How to migrate Nintendo Switch's MicroSD data using a Mac? I am considering upgrading my Nintendo Switch's storage by getting a MicroSD card with a larger capacity and then copying over the games, savegame data, etc to the new card.\nAlthough Nintendo has a support article about this, when it comes to Mac here's all they have to say:\n\nImportant: This process may not be able to copy the microSD card\ncontents correctly in environments other than Windows (such as Mac).\n\nOkay, thanks for the notice. But then, how is a Mac user supposed to accomplish this?\nI was wondering if this might be a task Disk Utility could handle. Or maybe there's some other utility app that can be downloaded for this purpose, or... if I'm lucky, maybe it is as simple as dragging over folder contents the way the steps indicate it is for Windows. (Probably should be sure to include any hidden files.) But the way the disclaimer is worded, it makes me concerned that there's something about trying this on a Mac that makes the process more involved.\nNintendo's \"recommended\" card formatting software, SD Memory Card Formatter, has a Mac version. So I'm not really clear on what part of this process is complicated on a Mac or why? All I can think of is: maybe macOS cannot read the formatted card after formatting?\nIf anyone who has tried this could enlighten me regarding what this process involves on a Mac, I would really appreciate it.\n(I'm currently using Mojave and Monterey, on different machines.)\n\nA: I see no issues at all with the file copying itself. The Mac is perfectly capable of such a simple operation to & from an SD card.\nWhat might be an issue is if the Nintendo doesn't like the Mac's 'dot files'  which it will add to the card. These contain a lot of Mac-specific information & are hidden in normal use. On other OSes, though, you can see them. Sometimes this makes no real difference other than cosmetic, but occasionally a device will be confused by them\nThis is quite a topic to go into deeply here, but there is already a popular QA on Ask Different covering all aspects of these files, from what precisely they are to how to deal with them. [Personally, I use Blue Harvest, which does it automatically - I use a lot of camera SD cards & this just keeps them 'tidy'. It might be a bit expensive for a one-off task.]\nSee Why are dot underscore ._ files created, and how can I avoid them?\n", "Q: External SSD causes \"Accessory needs more power\" when plugged into M1 iMac with external Thunderbolt monitor I have a new M1 iMac with two Thunderbolt ports.\nI want to use one to control a small external monitor, and the other to run a very fast external SSD.\nI was very disappointed to find that when the monitor is plugged in, I can't use the SSD. I get the warning:\n\nAccessory needs more power\nDisconnecting other accessories may allow this to work.\n\nI suppose that this is a limitation of the M1 Macs, but it pretty much renders one of the Thunderbolt ports useless.\nIs there any way to use both for what seems like a pretty normal use case (SSD + monitor)?\n\nA: Plug in the devices in a different order\nIn a discussion in the MacRumors forums, Vogon Poetry says that power is attributed based on the order in which things are plugged in.\nFor me, this meant that plugging in my SSD before my external monitor allowed both to function, whereas plugging in the monitor first caused the Accessory needs more power error.\n[update] Rebooting does not cause the SSD to be ejected (i.e. does not require re-establishing the plugging in order).\n", "Q: TRIM on Mac USB 3 & SSD Support I'm using various SSDs on a 15-inch mid-2014 MacBook Pro Retina having changed the original SSD for a larger size using an  adapter board: all are working fine with TRIM enabled.\nI use external SSDs on both USB 3 enclosures and in Thunderbolt 2 enclosures. The Thunderbolt LaCie Rugged and LBD enclosures show that I have enabled TRIM Force and are working but is it possible that TRIM can be enabled on USB in any workaround?\nWith modern SSDs i.e. Crucial BX MX and NVMe do they have their own built-in garbage collection/TRIM that works in the background?\nI'm trying to find an adapter for NVMe (I believe to SATA) so that I can put them in one of the Thunderbolt external enclosures I have. I find the complication of type confusing..\n\nA: Even without Trim support, a SSD Modern SDD maximum write time is still faster than transfer time through the USB 3 interface. Therefore, there would be no advantage to having Trim support. Here the limiting factor is the 5 Gb/s USB 3.0 ports.\nIf you find an adapter for NVMe to SATA so that you can put a NVMe SDD drive in one of the Thunderbolt external enclosures, then the limiting factor would be the 6 Gb/s SATA 3 interface.\n\nA: Regular USB 3.0 enclosure won't do it. What you need is enclosure with UASP support or factory-made external SSD with UASP support (like Samsung T5 & T7). Unfortunately as far as my experience goes not every UASP USB 3.0 enclosure is processed correctly by the OS (i.e. my Age Star USB 3.0 3UBCP3 is UASP-capable according to documentation but TRIM by macOS or Windows doesn't work out of the box). However if OS won't provide necessary TRIM automation you can use third-party tool to force send TRIM command to external SSD, i.e. in Windows you can use O&O Defrag 15+ CLI command /TRIM for NTFS, exFAT, FAT32 file systems on external SSDs (IIRC even non-UASP-ready!), that's what I do with my external SSDs formatted to exFAT. Another specific moment is file system of your external SSD, i.e. it looks like for APFS the minimum requirement is macOS Monterey.\n\nA: To answer your question:\n\n…but is it possible that Trim can be enabled on USB in any workaround? With modern SSDs i.e. Crucial BX MX and NVMe do they have their own built-in garbage collection/Trim that works in the background?\n\nTRIM is part of the SATA specification and is a function of the controller.  The drive merely responds to the TRIM command.  macOS can only send the command; if the USB to SATA controller doesn’t implement it, you can’t work around it.\n\nI'm trying to find an adapter for NVMe (I believe to SATA) so that I can put them in one of the Thunderbolt external enclosures I have.\n\nThis limitation applies here, too.  The hardware controller (NVME to SATA) must support TRIM. If not, just as in the USB adapters, you won’t be able to work around it.  Given that most Thunderbolt adapters are in the higher end of the spectrum (versus inexpensive USB enclosures), you should have no trouble finding one with TRIM support.\n", "Q: Unable to uninstall kops I'm trying to downgrade my kops version from 1.23.0 to 1.21.5.\nI tried to uninstall kops first, but I got this error:\n$ kops uninstall kops\nError: No such keg: /usr/local/Cellar/kops\n\nHere are some information about my kops\n$ kops version\nVersion 1.23.0 (git-a067cd7742a497a5c512762b9880664d865289f1)\n\n$ type -p kops\nkops is /usr/local/bin/kops\n\n$ ls -l $(type -p kops)\nls: is: No such file or directory\nls: kops: No such file or directory\n-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 my_name admin  165095824 Apr 20 13:23 /usr/local/bin/kops\n\n$ ls -l $(which kops)\n-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 my_name  admin  165095824 Apr 20 13:23 /usr/local/bin/kops\n\nI've tried to solve this problem by using similar commands in this question, but that doesn't work.\nRunning brew uninstall --force kops, and brew cleanup -s kops doesn't return any message.\nDoes anyone know how to solve No such keg: /usr/local/Cellar/kops error?\nMy macOS version is 12.5.1.

I have a strange error occurring with a 13 inch retina 2018 MacBook Air.\nUpon boot, I see the white apple logo and progress bar, and then the user accounts to log in. At this screen, I have about three to five seconds before the screen goes black. The computer is still responsive; the keyboard is still lit, and I can still click and type -- the screen just displays nothing but black. When I close and reopen the lid, with maybe about 75% consistency, the screen reappears, but then I have again about five seconds tops before it goes black again. Rarely, the screen isn't entirely black -- the very top row of pixels on the screen is lit, though it's hard to tell if they're displaying what they should be or just lighting randomly, since it's a single row of pixels.\nExternal displays don't go black, allowing me to confirm that the computer is indeed still responsive.\nI have tried several things:\n\n*\n\n*rebooting\n\n*resetting NVRAM/PRAM multiple times\n\n*running Disk Utility in macOS recovery (no errors found)\n\n*running in safe mode -- this one worked!

The fact that safe mode, booting, external displays, etc all work fine suggests to me that this isn't a hardware issue, but the fact that even a factory reset didn't fix it seems to suggest that it's not a software issue either. So I'm quite confused.\nGoogle isn't helping much either -- while I can find links which talk about a black screen problem (which is where I found some of the fixes I tried above), I haven't yet found one that talks about a screen which works for specific situations (booting, first five seconds, safe mode, etc) but then cuts to black.\nI am looking for ways to fix the problem, or even just ways to diagnose what the problem is.\n\nA: Safe Mode results are the clue here.\nThere is something that you installed that is doing this (something that runs at startup.)\nOR Some part of macOS is damaged. Reinstalling the same macOS version right over top of the currently installed OS should fix that issue. And doing that should result in no loss of files and/or settings. But to be sure backup the drive first.\n\nA: Launch agents and launch daemons are loaded by macOS at startup, but do not appear in the \"Login Items\" list.\nWhen you started the Mac in Safe Mode, the screen didn't go black because whatever-it-is that causes the video failure wasn't loaded. You will need to find the offending software, and delete it.\nThis MacWord article discusses this issue:\n\nSince OS 10.4 Tiger, Apple has given developers another mechanism for launching items automatically: launch daemons and agents that are controlled by the launchd process. This provides more flexibility for developers but it is less transparent to users.\nInstead of opening apps directly, launchd loads specially-formatted .plist documents that specify what should launch and under what circumstances. Sometimes these launch items run constantly in the background, sometimes they run at scheduled intervals, and sometimes they run as needed—for example, in response to an event such as a change in a certain file or folder—and then quit.\nThe .plist files that launchd uses can occupy any of five folders, and their location determines when the items load and with what privileges:\n\n*\n\n*Items in /Library/LaunchDaemons and /System/Library/LaunchDaemons load when your Mac starts up, and run as the root user.\n\n\n*Items in /Library/LaunchAgents and /System/Library/LaunchAgents load when any user logs in, and run as that user.\n\n\n*Items in /Users/your-username/Library/LaunchAgents load only when that particular user logs in, and run as that user.\nDon’t change System files: Of those five folders, the two located in the /System folder (/System/Library/LaunchDaemons and /System/Library/LaunchAgents) are for components included as part of macOS, and you should resist the temptation to remove or alter them—they’re essential to keep your Mac running correctly.\n\n*\n\n*Modify others as you like: Feel free to browse through the files in the other folders to see what’s there. You can modify them—for instance, to disable them or to change how often they run—but before you do, you should understand a few things about how they work.\n\nWhen you start your Mac or log in, the launch items in the relevant folders are loaded (that is, registered with the system) unless they have a Disabled flag set. Thereafter, their instructions will be carried out until you restart, even if you drag the launch item to the Trash. To see a list of all the currently loaded launch items on your Mac, open Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities) and type launchctl list and then press Return.\nIf you want to stop a launch item from running without your having to restart, open Terminal and type launchctl unload followed by a space and the full path to the launch item. An easy way to add an item’s full path is to drag it to the Terminal window) For example, take this command:\nlaunchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.FolderActions.enabled.plist\nIt unloads the launch agent that enables AppleScript folder actions. Repeat the command with load instead of unload to turn it back on.\nBecause most launch items run on a schedule or on demand, and because any of them could be disabled, the fact that something is present in one folder doesn’t necessarily mean the process it governs is currently running. To see what’s running at the moment, open Activity Monitor—but bear in mind that the name of a given process as shown in Activity Monitor might not resemble the name of the .plist file that tells macOS to launch it.\nOther explanations for mystery processes\nAlthough these methods are the most common ways to launch apps automatically in macOS, they aren’t the only ones. If you have a mystery process that you can’t track down in any of these places, it could also be one of these:\nKernel extensions: Kernel extensions, or kexts, live in /System/Library/Extensions and load at startup. They provide low-level features such as processing audio and adding support for peripherals. Most kexts on your Mac are part of macOS.

I thought there used to be a way with Zsh on the OSX where you could view a live print out of keys to bind event ids.

I tried the showkey brew package but that didn't seem to work.\nI'm trying to fix my alt+left&right arrow word jumping sequence when using a windows keyboard with my Mac.  I can't find the correct character for alt though.\n\nA: bindkey, a zle builtin, will show you the current bindings, discussed in detail in man zshzle. It allows selection between a number of builtins; emacs, numerous flavours of vi.\nxev will show codes for keypresses as they happen, though it's quite basic and probably won't show combinations as you might be expecting. IIRC this may be part of the XQuartz package. https://www.xquartz.org\nIn addition Karabiner Elements - Event Viewer shows keypresses and their codes, but in a different format to xev. This may be more appropriate.\n\nA: Function and cursor keys with modifiers generally send escape sequences that consist of the escape character followed by some printable ASCII characters.\nTo see what escape sequence a key or key chord sends, press Ctrl+V and then that key(chord). Ctrl+V removes the next character's special meaning, so the escape character at the beginning of the escape sequence is inserted as such. For example:\n\nmymac% ^V←^[[D\n\nThe Left key sends the three-character sequence escape, left bracket, capital D. The ^[ part is a single non-printable character which is represented visually as two characters, and which zsh shows in inverse video. All standard escape sequences start with escape then either left bracket or capital O.\nAlternatively, run cat then press the key.\n\nmymac% cat↩\n←^[[D\n\nWith the Alt modifier, there's an added wrinkle that it's usually encoded as the escape character followed by whatever the unmodified key sends. For example, Alt+1 sends escape, digit 1. For keys that themselves send an escape sequence, the behavior depends on the terminal: some send a different escape sequence; some send the same escape sequence; some follow the general rule and so end up sending two escape characters followed by a printable character. In that last case, with the Ctrl+V method, only the first escape character is inserted literally, and then the key has its normal effect. With the cat method, you'll see something beginning with ^[^[.\nMany terminals send the same escape sequence for a given key with a wide range of modifiers. Good terminals allow you to configure escape sequences. This is possible both with Terminal and with iTerm (in both cases, from the “Keys” or “Keyboard” tab of each profile).\n", "Q: Mobile network problem on iOS 15.6.1: can't downgrade After updating to iOS 15.6.1 I have mobile data problems:\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes the network is unreachable\n\n*Sometimes the network is slow\n\n*Sometimes 4G is unavailable and only 2.5G is available\n\nIt's just unreliable.

I live in Italy and i want to buy an iPhone 14 Pro when it comes out, but I don`t know if for the European iPhone models there will be the physical SIM slot as they announced that in the US the iPhone 14 will only have e-SIM.\n\nA: The iPhones 14 for Europe / Italy use physical nano-SIM and eSIM.  Only phones sold through US channels are eSIM only, so Asia, Europe, Africa, Canada and Mexico, Latin and Central and South America all still have a physical nano-SIM as well as an eSIM.\n\nDual SIM (nano‑SIM + eSIM)\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/it-it/HT212780\n", "Q: Does the iPhone 5S support iOS 13? My iPhone 5S has 16GB of data with 9.7GB used.\nIs it possible for iOS 13 to run on it?\n\nA: No version of iOS 13 will install or run for that phone.\nWikipedia is reliable for this kind of information, and it says the iPhone 5S only supports iOS 7 through 12. See also this answer which has Apple's stamp of approval.\nYou can't sideload iOS, and even if you could, iOS 13 wouldn't work since it doesn't run on the A7 processor which the iPhone 5S has.\n", "Q: Extremely low system speed I have a MacBook Pro 13\" Early 2015. Recently, my keyboard has broken. It first reported spurious hits, then after a few days nothing, so the computer was usable only with an external keyboard. While transferring all my data to another computer, I noticed that the speed of the system has much decreased. I wondered if I want the computer repaired, but with that low speed, this makes no sense. I decided to completely erase the SSD and reinstall MacOS, which I did following https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496. But even in recovery mode's disk utility and MacOS setup, I noticed how slow the computer reacts (e.g., when it shows window animations). Where can this come from?\nNote on the battery: some might suspect the battery has bloated. Therefore, I took out the battery and checked if the keyboard works without battery inserted, which is not the case. As of now, there is no battery inside.\n\nA: Removing the battery from intel based MacBooks slows the processor. To regain full speed, place a repaired battery in the Mac and run diagnostics to ensure the system is repaired and without fault.\n", "Q: Old Versions in app store I can't find any way to access the older versions.\nIs it in any way possible to download an older version of an app on App Store to support an older operating system?\n\nA: Purchasing old versions is nearly impossible, but some have managed it before in the past using computers and other devices if your device won’t let a purchase happen.\nIf the developer leaves the app up, Apple will still serve and sign the older versions of apps. This works well for apps you have purchased. Re-downloading is much easier than purchasing these apps.\nSome people go so far as to sync and archive the IPA files so they can jailbreak and side load apps or see if they can sync with official tools the versions they prefer, but this can be highly technical and goes deeper than “download” an old version.\n", "Q: Creating a virtual network through USB-port on thunderbolt Currently I am using a Windows VM so that I can use PUTTY to SSH into a device that is connected through a USB port to my MAC.

I'm suspecting that you're not actually connecting your computer to Thunderbolt-equipment - and as such ofcourse the Thunderbolt bridge won't be activated in that case.\nI would suggest that you look the Device Manager in Windows, where you can see the network interface. My guess is that the device is actually just a USB network adapter (i.e. it acts as such) and you will need to install the appropriate driver on macOS, depending on whether the device uses RNDIS, ECM, EEM or NCM (all over USB).\nYou have included information about your SSH setup. I would suggest using something simpler like \"ping\" to test connectivity first. The SSH information suggests that you might be simply trying to connect a Raspberry Pi or similar (i.e. the device is actually just a Linux computer) - in that case it is not the Thunderbolt bridge you want - it is a USB networking interface (implemented using the Linux gadget system).\n", "Q: Preview in BigSur I have a  problem with Preview.\nI have an image A.jpg, I make a rotation and \"Save As\" (with ALT key) as A-rotate.jpg.\nQuit Preview, go to Finder.\nReopen A.jpg is rotated and A-rotate.jpg too.\n\nA: Preview, like Pages, Numbers, TextEdit and other Apple apps -- automatically saves any changes you make to a document.

Whether with touchscreen keyboard or external Bluetooth keyboard, it is possible to select some alternative keyboard layouts. But is it possible to remap keys arbitrarily so as to support various layouts that are not supported in iOS out of the box?

And would it be possible to extend this mapping to support external Bluetooth accessory type hardware keyboards?\n\nA: There are already a great many alternative screen keyboards available in the App Store from 3rd parties, plus whole systems for adding and making them like Keyman. But so far Apple has not provided any way for app makers to include custom hardware layouts.\n(Unfortunately Keyman Developer is only a Windows app at present)\nA list of hardware layouts provided by Apple as of iOS 11 can be found here.

When I'm done, I usually just quit the app.  Whenever I launch it again, it attempts to re-open the connection that was previously open during the last run, which usually is different from the vncloc I'm opening at the time.\nI know I could prevent this by closing the connection before quitting the app, but I'd like to know if there's a trick to tell it to never reopen connections on launch, or ideally: if I'm opening a connection via a vncloc file, don't re-open previous connections (otherwise do open previous connections).\nI don't see that option in the preferences.  Is there a way to achieve this?\n\nA: You can press ⌘+⌥+Q to close all windows and quit the app.\nThis only applies if the system preferences option to reopen windows is enabled (the default setting), since if it's disabled it will always close all windows.\nThere is no option to disable reopening windows on a per-app basis, and Screen Sharing does not have the options you're looking for built in so you'll have to rely on the system behaviors.\n", "Q: gzip file in the finder Is it possible to add gzip (or any other command-line commands) as an option when you right-click on files in the Finder?

I am running Mac OS Big Sur (11) and I don't like the Preview App (bundled app) much.  Since the Preview app's version is 11 and Big Sur is 11, I assume the app is tied to the OS and not capable of being updated without a new OS.   I would assume that with a new OS I would get an updated Preview app - the search function does not use whole strings, just individual words....\nCan someone confirm that the more recent OS comes with a new version of the Preview app?\n\nA: Yes, Apple bundles Preview, TextEdit, Safari* and other applications with the OS, and each version that comes with each OS is broadly reliant on that OS.\nAdmittedly, Preview is still on version 11.0 (build 1033.4) in Monterey, though I suspect there are differences nonetheless.\nPreview is just a wrapper for various OS functions, like creating a window with a PDF or image in it.\nFurthermore, the OS is now on a sealed read-only volume, so you can't really replace the existing bundled apps.\n(* It is possible to upgrade Safari independently of the OS.)\n", "Q: In Numbers.app, how can I trigger a response if newly input cell text matches text found anywhere in other sheets?

How can I reduce my MacBook Pro 2015's CPU clock speed or power consumption?

If the latter is there a recommended process for my end result of Mac partition, Windows and shared exFat space?\n\nA: According to error description (perhaps caused by APFS Snapshot usage by Time Machine) you may have Time Machine up and running that causes such behavior. To double-check if you've got those snapshots use tmutil listlocalsnapshots / in Terminal.\nBasically you need to remove all Time Machine backups stores, disable all destinations, etc. You can re-associate your backups later. Detailed explanation about snapshots is in this answer and this article. Detailed instructions are provided in this help article by Apple. Remember that snapshots aren't exactly backups and are recreated every hour, so no harm deleting them as far as you keep your backup. Then you should be able to resize your APFS volume via Disk Utility or Terminal just as you attempted earlier.\nIf you want to delete local snapshots manually, turn off Time Machine temporarily. Here's extract from Apple's help article:\n\nHow local snapshots use storage space\nYou don't need to think about how much storage space local snapshots are using, because they don't use space needed for tasks like downloading files, copying files, or installing new software.\nYour Mac counts the space used by snapshots as available storage. Even so, Time Machine stores snapshots only on disks that have plenty of free space, and it automatically deletes snapshots as they age or as space is needed for other things.\nIf you want to delete local snapshots manually, turn off Time Machine\ntemporarily:\n\n*\n\n*Open Time Machine preferences from the Time Machine menu  in the menu bar. Or choose Apple (left-top) > System Preferences, then click Time Machine.\n\n*Deselect ”Back Up Automatically” or click the Off/On switch, depending on what you see in Time Machine preferences.\n\n*Wait a few minutes to allow the local snapshots to be deleted. Then turn on Time Machine again. It remembers your backup disks.\n\nHow often local snapshots are saved\nTime Machine saves one snapshot of your startup disk approximately\nevery hour, and keeps it for 24 hours. It keeps an additional snapshot\nof your last successful Time Machine backup until space is needed. And\nin macOS High Sierra or later, another snapshot is saved before\ninstalling any macOS update.\n\nIn case you decide to reinstall everything from scratch let me know, I will update the answer on that. But you should be fine with your initial plan once you turn off Time Machine stores temporarily.\n\nA: I would personally grow the APFS container by the 10 GB and put an external drive for the FAT common file store.\nYou can’t easily defragment APFS and it’s been out for several years, so whatever has prevented people from updating third party utilities is likely to continue.\nmacOS will run far better with undo snapshots and time machine backups with more space as opposed to less space. Also, the OS is a read only, sealed snapshot so any attempts to control them with Time Machine alone need to be lucky to succeed.\nWe would need you to post where your space on the Mac side is consumed to give more advice on what to move to an external to then try your shrink operation, technically your command is sound and will succeed once the system frees block allocations to accommodate the shrink.\nStart with a system information post on the usage and consider a tool like Daisy Disk if the native space usage commands don’t get you an idea where your space has gone to prevent the shrink operation.\n", "Q: Reminders app won't sync on macOS Monterey, remaining blank and unresponsive I have a problem with the Reminders app on my iMac that after upgrading to a 2TB SSD, installing the latest version of Monterey and using a Time Machine backup to restore my files. The problem I am having is as follows:\n\n*\n\n*The Reminders app remains blank and does not sync any lists or any reminders.\n\n*The lists or reminder fields do not appear on this particular iMac despite the fact that Reminders syncs without any problems on other Macs and iPhone I own and that the iCloud copy also syncs correctly with these other devices.\n\n*I am not able to add or remove any lists (or reminders for that matter) as the button to add a list does not work when I click on it.\n\nI contacted Apple Support and they told me to:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off and on reminders using my AppleID on System Preferences and restart my computer, but that did not help.\n\n*Remove the caches on the Library folder but that did not help.\n\n*Reinstall macOS Monterey but that did not help either; and finally\n\n*Create another user account and transfer all my data to this new user, which I know it will work (as I tried it with Apple Support successfully); however, this means I will lose all the configurations from my other apps and macOS and I will have to recreate a very complex user account from scratch, which is quite a bummer.\n\nI tried to follow other suggestions on this and other websites, but they either did not work or were outdated. Is there any way to solve this problem?\n\nA: After trying many things that Apple Support and this and other websites recommended without success, I decided to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Quit Reminders.\n\n*Go to ~/Library/Reminders/\n\n*Remove all folders from this folder\n\n*Restart Reminders.\n\nHowever, this did not work. I was stuck with the same problem. Still no syncing and the app remained unresponsive. I decided to pray about it and I got inspired, or so it seems and then did the following:\n\n*\n\n*Launch Activity Monitor on the /Applications/Utilities folder.\n\n*Search for remindd, the Reminders background app, and made it Quit in Activity Monitor by selecting on the list view and click on the button with a cross. (These two steps might not be needed but I think it might be important to avoid any database corruption due to a sudden sync event while you are doing the following steps).\n\n*Go to ~/Library/Reminders/\n\n*However, do not remove the folders MLModels and Stores; first make a backup of them by copying them to the Desktop or whatever place you'd like.\n\n*Make these folders empty by sending their contents (and not these folders themselves) to the trash by means of Command + Backspace or by dragging their contents to the trash.\n\n*Relaunch the Reminders app and voilá, you should have all your reminders back.\n\n", "Q: How to make MacBook battery last as long as possible while watching videos?

One is a 2018 MacBook Pro and the other is a 2020 M1 Mac Mini. Both are running macOS Monterey 12.5.1.\nI frequently alternate using these two machines to edit files stored in iCloud.\nThe problem is that the files I update on one machine are not automatically syncing on the other machine. The problem goes in both directions.\nI've only found two ways to force a sync:\nOne is to reboot one or the other machine. (Or log out and log back in.) The other is to manually download the files from iCloud.com and replace the stale files with fresh copies. Obviously, neither approach is practical in the long term.\nIf I don't reboot, the sync never seems to take place. (I have waited as long as 2 days.)\nI'm completely stumped. At the moment I only see three alternatives:\n\n*\n\n*Pin down the source of the problem, if it's fixable.\n\n\n*Switch to a different OS.\n\n\n*Incorporate an alternative syncing mechanism to iCloud (such as cloud storage by Microsoft, Google, Syncthing, etc.).\nI have no idea how easy it is to replace iCloud with cloud services from other companies.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: You experience is uncommon - it's not how iCloud works for most others. Therefore I would suggest pinning down the source of the problems and fix them.\nIt sounds likely that your issue is that the iCloud synchronisation program does not realise that your file has changed. Another possibility is that it does know that it has changed, but does not start synchronising it for some reason.\nThe iCloud synchronisation program uses the same method for detecting file changes as the Time Machine. So it would be an easy way of finding out more by checking whether Time Machine works properly.\nAlso make sure you have not yourself changed the system in terms of for example disabling the fseventsd or bird daemon or similar. You should also check whether you have moved about the iCloud folder itself, or you are using symbolic links for the files or folders that you have problems with.\nYou can check what the syncronisation program is doing by running the following command in the Terminal:\nbrctl monitor -i\n\nIf you add or modify a file in your iCloud Drive, you should see that it instantly recognizes the change - and you should also upload progress, etc.\nAs I understand it, you can pinpoint a single file and to say that this file has not been synchronised properly. You can also use the same tool to get specific information about that file like this:\nbrctl diagnose --doc filename\n\nHere you must replace \"filename\" with the path and name of that file. An easy way to do that is to open Finder and drag the file into the Terminal - the path and name of the file will be pasted.\nAfter running the command, you're presented with a compressed diagnostics archive for sending to Apple for further scrutiny. You can unpack that and look at the file document-info.txt, which contains information about your chosen file - including previous versions, synchronisation status, etc.\nYou can also look at the log output from the synchronisation program by running the following command in the Terminal:\nlog stream --predicate \"processImagePath contains 'bird'\"\n\nWhen you save the a file to your iCloud Drive, you should see log messages shortly thereafter indicating that the change has been detected and that it will be synchronized. Similarly you can run the command on the receiving end to see when/if it downloads the changed file.\nYou can try looking into the system activity and whether or not the system has realised your files have changed - by using for example the free FSEventsParser command line program.\nIf you rather want a GUI approach, you can get a free 14-day trial of the FSMonitor program.\n\nA: I have moved my files over to Microsoft OneDrive and so far this seems successful. OneDrive has so far kept files synced essentially instantly. It also has a force sync button (which iCloud lacks), but so far I haven't needed to use it.\nThe online web interface of OneDrive is surprisingly responsive and well laid out. It is worlds beyond Apple's web interface to iCloud, which I regard as something of an embarrassment to Apple, and really almost unusable.\nI initially had a small issue with having to rename a number of files whose names contained characters that iCloud allows but OneDrive does not.\nAnother initial issue was having to explicitly give Emacs full disk access and open files inside OneDrive using the menu. Once that was done once, access to OneDrive files and folders was transparent.\nThe basic OneDrive account for 2 dollars a month in the US gives 100GB of storage. Apple's iCloud gives 200GB for the same price. Given how much better OneDrive is than iCloud, I think it's well worth the difference in price.\nI haven't attempted to sync my calendar and other accounts with OneDrive, and I doubt that's even possible, so I'm only talking about  file storage.\n\nA: On the machine that is not getting the updates from iCloud, open Activity Monitor and find the process title \"bird\" (the BIRD daemon) and stop it (the circle with the X in the toolbar)\nIt will start again all on its own and when it does the files that are waiting in iCloud should update on your machine.\nAt least they do on mine.\nThis is the only way I have found so far to force iCloud to sync.

Please help, I dont know what else to do anymore\nI would super appreciate if someone can help fix this\nI have a few questions though\nShould I use Shared Network on Parallels or Wi-Fi or something else?\nShould I install tools inside the VM or outside the VM?\n\nA: When faced with network issues like this I find the easiest and most reliable method is a USB to Ethernet adapter that is passed through to the VM. It may be considered “sloppy”, as the network stack in the VM host should be able to manage this, but it does work. By passing through the USB Ethernet adapter the guest VM has complete control of the network, the host network settings become irrelevant and cannot interfere.  It may be necessary for the virtual interfaces to be disconnected or otherwise somehow disabled for the best results since the guest VM may get confused if there is some possible alternate path to follow.\nIf your internet is not by Ethernet then try Bluetooth or WiFi.  A problem with using wireless on a VM while the host is also wireless is the two can interfere and make things worse for both.  That can be resolved by disabling the host wireless connection.  With the host networking disabled then that will absolutely force the guest VM to direct all network traffic through the USB network adapter (again be that Ethernet, Bluetooth, or whatever) and that way the host isn’t getting in the way.\nI recognize this involves a hardware workaround to a software problem, hardware that you may not have and would rather not have to buy, but it’s the path of least resistance for me.\n", "Q: How accurate is ultra wideband?

I know uwb is low frequency and can go through most walls but assuming it bounces off, how can this be calculated?\n\nA: Apple’s implementation is very good in my testing.

That selects text going backwards from the insertion point, without changing anything, but since it highlights the text it is instantly visible. To put everything back the way it was, let go of \"shift\" and type a right-arrow.\nNote if the insertion point is not on the currently displayed page, shift-left-arrow causes TextEdit and Pages (at least) to first jump to the page with the insertion point.\nOf course, as with everything in life, there's an exception: it doesn't work if the insertion point is at the beginning of the document. So, try shift-right-arrow if shift-left-arrow doesn't work.\n", "Q: Use MacOS Mail Big Sur on external SSD with MacOS Mail Sierra on Mac HD? My 2015 iMac continues to run Sierra for the sake of some software, but I have recently installed Big Sur on an external SSD. I would like to use Big Sur’s Mail application, but I don’t want to have to import my existing Mail structure into the external boot drive.  How can I use Big Sur’s Mail application and save all mails onto the Mac HD in the existing folders under Sierra’s Mail?\n\nA: You should not try to do this! You would be in serious danger of losing all your Mail.\nMail is stored in the ~/Library/Mail folder. Each version of macOS changes the structure and content of this folder. So you can't have one common Mail folder used by both Sierra and Big Sur.\nIf you want to access Mail from both Sierra and Big Sur you must keep them separate and configure what you need on each system.\nYou already have Mail on Sierra, so it is a matter of creating Mail accounts on Big Sur. Mail will download all your mail from whatever mail service(s) you use.\nCaveat: I am assuming that you mail services use the IMAP protocol. If any of the Mail accounts use the POP protocol, I would not do even the above unless you are happy that you can recover your mail in the event of a mishap.\n", "Q: Automate copying new file in specific folder to clipboard I'm using a macOS app to create GIFs (called GifFox) but the app does not offer a feature to auto-save to clipboard.

Before upgrading to iOS 16, I'd like to know: can one downgrade from iOS 16 to iOS 15?\nI saw some articles discussing iOS 16 beta downgrade but not iOS 16 downgrade. Since some OS upgrades such as Pixel 6's Android 13 upgrade aren't reversible, I'm being cautious.\n\nA: Yes, you can.\nYou need to download an iOS 15 IPSW from Apple. You can the latest IPSWs at: https://ipsw.me/\nBe sure to pick a signed IPSW.\nGo to Finder, then select your plugged in device. Hold option and click restore iPhone.\nThen pick the IPSW you downloaded, and restore your device.\nYou will be downgraded to the iOS version that was in the IPSW you downloaded.\n\nA: Apple lets you run and upgrade the previous version of iOS now, but only for a very short period can you downgrade a major version (and then only to the current version, not some arbitrary past version).\nDo not sleep on this chance, turn off automatic updates immediately and downgrade immediately if you can’t be on iOS 16 for the long haul.\nIf you’re on the fence, go to 15.7 for stability and security updates and turn off automatic updates while you decide on the upgrade. I did this myself, and will wait for new hardware and / or iPadOS 16 to jump to 16 myself.\nNow, what is new for iOS 16 is rapid security responses which “update” iOS. These can be rolled back until the next proper update, but that’s not really what I think you’re asking here.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204\n\nIf you need to remove a Rapid Security Response:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > General > About.\n\n*Tap iOS Version.\n\n*Tap Remove Security Update.\n\nYou can reinstall the Rapid Security Response later, or wait for it to\nbe installed permanently as part of a standard software update.\n\n\nA: You can try using IPSW, but I have found that not to work. What I would strongly recommend is saving a backup of your iPhone to your computer before proceeding. Creating a backup should allow you to roll back to iOS 15. I had to do this to my iPad running iPadOS 16 Public Beta 1, and it was extremely hard to get off. I had to use my old iPad running iPadOS 14, and use that as a backup source. So unless you can guarantee you will like the upgrade, do not upgrade.\nHowever, I have used iOS 16 on my phone for months now, ever since the first public beta was released, and never once have regretted installing it.\nTreat it like it is not reversible, because it almost certainly will not be reversible.\n\nA: Apple officially stopped supporting downgrading from iOS 16 to iOS 15, according to Reddit user dgherastovschi:\n\nApple unsigned that ipsw, so as of today you cannot downgrade from iOS 16 to iOS 15.\n\n", "Q: How to copy files into a directory by AppleScript?

It must also be on a separate subnet to your WiFi otherwise it will conflict with the DHCP server on your router.\nThe 169.254 'address' is indicative of no IP address assigned, not an actual address, and is actually the current state of the iMac Ethernet device, not the Diskstation. So your ping is actually pinging the iMac's Ethernet, not the Diskstation.\nThe easiest option would be to connect the Diskstation to your router instead and let that handle address allocation. You'll then be able to see it from any device on your network, Bonjour will work properly so you can address it with a meaningful name e.g. diskstation.local etc...\n", "Q: Question about macOS Bootcamp I have a mid-2012 Intel Macbook Air (256GB) which is physically fine.\nI had bought it second-hand in 2017 & the seller specified that it was only running Windows 10 & did not have macOS installed.

I just graduated high school a few months ago, and got accepted to a college. However, my enrollment is not happening until October so I dont have a personal institution email.\nSo, is it possible for me to qualify for the educational discounts that Apple offers before the enrollment?\n\nA: Apple puts much of the information online so you can do some research before you call or go in to shop.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/education/college-students/\nDepending on which region you will be purchasing, the college bundles and limited time deals are often the steepest discount and best value for some accessories like AirPods around.\nHere is the current US program: https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store\nThe pre sales phone support can help if you’re not certain if you have been accepted and Apple does audit these purchases later so you would need to show them your offer letter or other documentation should your purchase be audited after you pay the discounted price.

My final goal is to dual-boot Linux\n\nA: \nNote: The answer below assumes the EFI partition is installed on disk0s1 with the name EFI. This is the default for Intel Macs. Also, the version of rEFInd downloaded is assumed to be 0.13.3.1.\n\nOn all Intel Mac models, the firmware (Mac Startup Manager) never checks for the installation of rEFInd when rEFInd is installed using the default settings. Therefore, the rEFInd installation is not displayed when holding the option key while starting the Mac.\nBelow are the reasons an icon for rEFInd is not displayed by the Mac Startup Manager. The file and folder exist in the volume labeled EFI in the EFI partition identified by disk0s1.\n\n*\n\n*The folder EFI/refind needs to be changed to EFI/BOOT.\n\n*The file refind_x64.efi need to be renamed bootx64.efi.\n\nOne way to get rEFInd to appear in the Mac Startup Manager is to reinstall rEFInd by using the steps given below. The steps assume you are booted to macOS and have SIP enabled.\n\n*\n\n*Remove the existing installation of rEFInd. You can use the commands below to accomplish this.\ndiskutil unmount disk0s1\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1\ncd /Volumes/EFI/EFI\nrm -rf refind tools\ncd ~\ndiskutil unmount disk0s1\n\n\n\n*Install rEFInd using the --usedefault option.

No such file exists.\nI'm searching for other sources from which this value might have arrived.  It did not used to be there, and seems fishy.\nSuggestions on where to search next?\n\nA: There's really nothing fishy about it.\nYour computer tries to determine its own name automatically. This is perfectly normal. It does so by contacting servers on your local network and, depending on your specific network setup, remote servers typically hosted by your internet service provider.\nIt is very common for home and small business ISPs to give out IP addresses to their customers in a dynamic way (i.e. every time your home \"modem\" connects to the ISP and periodically, it could be given a new, seemingly random IP from their pool of addresses).\nAn IP address usually has a name given to it (determined by a so called \"reverse lookup\" in DNS). For home users this is all typically handled by their ISP. It's usually not something the ISP pays much attention to at all. It is very common to just see the names being listed as \"dynA_B_C_D\" (with the capital letters being the IP address) or similar.\nIn your case, they had the name \"GJThinkPad\" listed for your IP at the time.\nIt's not a problem, it's not fishy.

If I have to resort to this, how do I do it?\n\nA: I found that if you ask Siri for something which requires a long answer (like “what is your favorite color “) while she is responding you can turn her volume all the way down to a whisper. She apparently has a separate volutes from the system setting. After that all Siri replies will be a whisper. Not a great solution but helps for now till Apple fixes this rather glaring problem.\n", "Q: Undo a diskutil partitioning attempt?

The Lightning to 3.5 mm Adapter is in itself a USB audio interface, so the digital to analog (DAC) is actually inside the adapter cable.\nIn essence this means that there is no inherent latency advantage in using the 3.5 mm adapter over a USB audio interface in general.\n", "Q: Error hdiutil: create failed - File exists -> but the file does not exist until this command fails Trying to create a .dmg file on an NFS share.\n    % rm -f store.dmg && ls -l store.dmg\n    ls: store.dmg: No such file or directory\n    % hdiutil create -size 300g -fs APFS -volname Temp store.dmg || ls -l store.dmg\n    hdiutil: create failed - File exists\n    -rw-r--r--  1 risner  wheel  0 Sep 13 22:44 store.dmg\n\nDisk Utility also fails with a file exists error.\nI can read and write files on the NFS share fine.

Which is not what the issue is (I have that turned off anyway).\nThe spaces themselves remain in place, the apps within them however are redistributed to another space on every startup.\nThe primary apps that seem affected are:\n\n*\n\n*Google Chrome\n\n*Visual Studio Code\n\nThese stand out to me as they are typically sized larger than what my laptop screen can fit, in my mind on startup (before the Mac recognises the external monitor) they are resized and in doing so moved, but this is me trying to come up with some explanation for the madness.\nTo note; I have \"Displays have separate Spaces\" enabled to allow each monitor to have it's own Space by design.\nTrying to use this functionality when on every restart I have to spend 5 minutes manually recognising and dragging apps back to where they belong is absolutely killer.\nEDIT: In addition to trying the wake timing as noted in a reply below, I've also attempted the fix in this (7 year old) thread I dug out on the same subject.

Requesting assistance to restore functionality of Boot Camp I recently had a working Boot Camp partition with Windows 7 operational.  I made the mistake of creating a 3rd partition to install a version of macOS do to program requirements, attempting to keep the older OS X El Capitan partition for depreciated programs.  I then realized Boot Camp only allows for up to 4 partitions and proceeded to remove the new fourth partition and restore the previous 4 partition configuration with a Time Machine backup.  Unfortunately, after the system restore, I am left unable to boot to Windows 7 with the option key on startup.\nI'm very much hoping there is a way to restore functionality to the Boot Camp partition.  It is still viewable in the device list but in Disc Utility it is not visible.  In Recovery boot, the partition is listed as it would normally.  I will post some pertinent info below:\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Windows 7 uses the MBR partition table. Currently this table only has one entry. You will need to edit the first entry and add the 3 missing entries. This can be accomplished by using the gdisk command. The installer for this command can be download from this GPT fdisk SourceForge website.\n\nNote: To use gdisk, SIP needs to be disabled.\n\nThe command to enter in a Terminal application window is given below.\nsudo gdisk /dev/disk0\n\nThe gdisk command is interactive.

In other words, you did not have to \"remove the new fourth partition and restore the previous 4 partition configuration\". For example, if you added a new APFS partition as the fourth partition, then you could have entered 2 3 5 in gdisk instead of the 2 3 4 entry given in the above table.\n", "Q: Should I downgrade my MacBook Air 2017? I recently found my MacBook Air 2017 becomes slower after upgrading it to the latest macOS. And, now it's too slow when I write code in vsCode and if I switch screens then it's laggy sometimes. I have already tried to upgrade vsCode & macOS also removed extensions but nothing changes. I have seen some laptops with the same configuration and ubuntu installed on them work fine with the same project. So, I think the newer version of macOS is good for newer models.\nSo, should I downgrade my macOS to the previous version which was installed in it when I bought it?\nMacBook Air 2017:\n1.8 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 with 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\nMemory usage: Activity Monitor\n\nCPU usage: Activity Monitor\n\n\nA: In general, no. An erase and install on the latest OS generally gets the best performance on macOS.\nMost of the speed gains come from the erase and install, so you can do the erase and install and get the latest OS for best support, security and often performance.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/erase-and-reinstall-macos-mh27903/mac\nThe erase step is key, doing that from recovery and then installing the latest seems to restore a ton of speed for our 2013/2015 and newer Macs at work.\n\nA: In general, if Apple says a new OS can run on your Mac, then it should run as well as older versions. One of the reasons they cut off older Macs is because they can't get or guarantee decent performance.\nDefinitely have a look at Activity Monitor: see what processes are using the most CPU and memory. What's your RAM usage? (Bear in mind that with only 8Gb, macOS will use it all -- but how is it being used? What's the memory pressure, and how much swap?)\nAlso, make sure that any third-party Launch Agents, Login Items, and other 'background' processes are up-to-date and compatible with the new OS. You could also try clearing caches (boot to Safe Boot mode, and out again.)\nAlso, you say you've upgraded VSCode. Any chance that the new version (and other software you're running) is just more demanding? Let's face it, a 2-core 8Gb Air is not the development tool of choice, even in 2017.\n", "Q: Can I use Siri, but prevent Maps on iOS from automatically starting the route? When I use Siri to ask iOS Maps to find a route (for example \"Map a route to 123 Main St.\"), Maps displays the whole route for a second or so, then starts navigation, which makes it very difficult to see any part of the route except my current location.\n(Entering the destination directly in Maps has the behavior I want, but that's an extra step it would be nice to avoid.)\nIs there a way to use Siri, but prevent navigation from starting until I've had a chance to review the route?\n\nA: This procedure works well for me:\n\n*\n\n*Open Maps and enter a place or address\n\n*Tap on the address/place you want to go to\n\n*Tap on the big blue button that gives you the duration of the trip\n\n*You should get a map with one or more routes at top and a list of those routes at the bottom\n\n*Tap on one of the durations on the left NOT the big \"go\" button on the right\n\n*Maps will display written directions including mileage\n\nOr if you prefer\n\n\n*Place two fingers on the map and zoom in to view a birds-eye view of the suggested routes.\n\nThe only time it goes right to navigation is by pressing the green \"Go\" button.

When I move my pointer to a different screen, I have to click on it first to activate it, then proceed with what I want to do.\nIs there a way to disable this feature?\n\nA: This is inherent to the macOS paradigm, & opposite to Windows behaviour.\nThe first click is to activate [bring to the front] the chosen app or window without performing any accidental clicks within it. Windows chose to do it the other way round, the first click can also perform an action.\nI've often thought each of these choices is simply what you get used to and the opposite is irritating;)\nThere are some functions that can be done without activating first - if you hover over the red/yellow/green dots of a backgrounded window you will see they highlight & can be actioned directly, but generally this should not happen.\n", "Q: Problem with internal SSD partitions I mistakenly used Disk Utility to remove a Bootcamp partition, which has left a ‘ghost’ disk (showing as physical & internal) of 128GB that I can’t seem to remove.\nI have wiped the SSD and reinstalled macOS, but the disk is still there. Could someone help me merge the 128GB disk with my 1TB SSD?\nAttached are some screen shots:\n\n\n\n\nA: Your Mac has two internal SSDs. Normally, Apple did not sell the 27-inch 2019 iMac configured this way. Any SATA drive provided by Apple is normally a HDD because the 6 Gb/s SATA interface is faster than Apple HDDs, which do not exceed 3 Gb/s. All SDDs from Apple for the 27-inch 2019 iMac use the faster PCI-Express. If one wished to have a 1 TB SSD, then Apple would sell the Mac with PCI-Express 1 TB SSD. The 1 TB drive would not be SATA. In such a case, there would be no SATA drive installed.\nYou could merge the two drives by creating a Fusion drive. You probably want to have a Fusion drive since the smaller SSD is significantly faster than the larger SSD. In other words, the larger drive is limited by being legacy 6 Gb/s SATA drive. The smaller drive is a PCI-Express drive which does not have a 6 Gb/s limitation\nYou could try using the command diskutil resetFusion to create the Fusion drive. See the Apple website How to fix a split Fusion Drive for further instructions. You may have problems using the instructions because the larger drives is a SSD and not a HDD. If so, I can post other commands to create the Fusion Drive.\n\nAlternate Possible Configuration\nInstead of creating a Fusion drive, this configuration would put macOS on the faster drive and the users' data on the slower drive.\nYou could erase the smaller faster PCI-Express SDD and install macOS there. You can then set the home directory for each account to be on the larger slower SATA SDD. To do this, first goto the User & Groups pain of system preferences. Next, select Advanced Options... for a user, as shown below.\n\nFinally, change the home directory to be on the larger slower SATA SDD, as shown below.\n\nI should also point out you would get significantly greater performance by add a Thunderbolt 3 external SDD, which be slightly slower that the smaller internal and exceptionally faster then the larger internal drive. You could use the larger internal drive for archiving and backups. You also would be able to instal Windows 10 on this external drive.\n", "Q: Disable iTerm context menu popup I am trying to cut and paste text but the iTerm popup keeps impeding me.

Strangely, it seems like if you take an \"entire screen\" screenshot, e.g. with ⌘⇧3, it compresses the colour gamut down to sRGB:\n\nBut if you take a screenshot of part of the screen or a specific window, e.g. with ⌘⇧4, it leaves it in your display's colour profile:\n\nSo you can simply use ⌘⇧4 and drag the crosshairs to cover your entire display.

I can still see that the images are 'in the ballpark'\nUsing example images from WebKit org & screenshotting each, rather than importing the original files. This gives them all the same colour profile, that of the Mac's display.

Try Safari, which has good, usable defaults.\nTo investigate further we need to know your workflow - what the input profiles are, what file types, what app is being used to view & what colour settings it's using.\nBrowsers such as Chrome & Firefox have some odd defaults which may need changing. Photoshop is frequently set up wrongly for colour workflow by unsuspecting users.\n", "Q: iMac Mojave suddenly became **extremely** slow on login My 5 year-old iMac has been a rock - until yesterday. Suddenly, it became extremely sluggish with nothing but spinning wheels & beach balls. Even closing an app required 5 minutes or more. I finally managed to shut down & reboot.\nThe reboot seemed a normal pace, but afterwards, login was excruciatingly slow. After an approx 5 minute login process, I ran Activity Monitor to see if perhaps the dreaded BitDefender has commandeered all resources, but there was very little resource utilization for any process shown in AM!\nThis felt like a HDD problem, so I ran First Aid w/ Disk Utility on Macintosh HD from the Volumes view. It concluded with a green checkmark & Operation successful after checking 18 snapshots (?! what??).\nI then switched to Device view & ran First Aid on Fusion Drive, Container disk4 and Macintosh HD (again). In all 3 cases, First Aid reported: green checkmark & Operation successful.\nContinuing on to the Disk Images (Apple disk image Media & macOS Base System), First Aid again reported green checkmark & Operation successful.\nThese results seem to indicate that all is well, no? However, an odd thing (to me) was that Disk Utility (Volumes view) reports a 2.12TB HDD (APFS) for Macintosh HD, but the macOS Base System reports only 2.01GB w/ 1.28GB used & 733 MB free. Switching to Devices view shows a \"Fusion Drive\" of 2.12TB, a \"Container disk4\" with 2.12TB consisting of:\n\n*\n\n*Macintosh HD (163.3GB)\n\n*3 Not Mounted (11.63GB)\n\n*Free (1.95TB)\n\nAfter all of this, it still feels like a HDD issue, but I cannot even guess what it might be. I'm puzzled by the fact that only 2GB of a 2TB drive are allocated to Macintosh HD - Why??. I've changed nothing on this machine; it's used almost exclusively by my partner who emphatically claims she's not changed anything - and I'm sure that's true.\nI've looked through all of the \"similar questions\". I've run the \"Diagnostics\" (holding down the D key), but this effort seemed useless & inspired no confidence. About 1/3 through the Diagnostic process with 2 minutes (of the initial estimated 3 minutes) remaining, the \"diagnostics\" declared that everything is OK  :O  But it's not OK! The diagnostics then led me to a reboot, claiming that I'd go to Safari which would give me \"options\" for further troubleshooting led to a boot, but upon reaching Safari & clicking on \"A\" for Apple, I get marketing BS about a new iPhone!\nGiven that none of the answers to the similar questions were selected as correct, I don't expect a \"silver bullet\" answer here. However, I do hope that someone might offer an explanation of a 2GB Macintosh HD on a 2TB Fusion Drive, and perhaps suggest another line of troubleshooting to pursue.

Based on the results from DriveDx, I believe the Fusion Drive is the source of my issues.\nA visit to IFIXIT revealed two facts:\n\n*\n\n*Apple gave no thought to maintenance of the iMac - or if they did, that thought was directed at how to impede customer-performed maintenance!\n\n\n*Mortals like myself should take heed, and outsource HDD replacement! Consequently, I made an appointment with the local \"Apple Store\" to have the problem remedied by one of their \"Geniuses\".\nUnfortunately, my appointment with the \"Genius\" took 3 hours out of my life, but yielded no repair and no real solution. A nice enough fellow, but as a \"genius\" he came up a bit short (as I understand the meaning of this word). After 2+ hours of running tests, the \"Genius\" was unable to diagnose the problem, and offered only one \"solution\": \"Buy a new iMac\".\n<rant>What a great company Apple is: Their \"solution\" to failure of a HDD in their 5 yr-old computer is to condemn the entire machine to a landfill. Meanwhile, they simultaneously make suspect claims about how environmentally friendly their products are. With \"friends\" like these - who needs enemies?</rant>\nUp next: IFIXIT has some detailed guides for replacing the Fusion Drive. After perusing a few of them now, it's clear (but not easy) on how to remove the SSD component of Apple's ill-conceived Fusion Drive. It also seems that Apple's APFS does not (effectively) support conventional (rotating disk) HDDs - meaning that the HDD component of Apple's Fusion Drive must be replaced with a SSD. What is not yet clear is exactly how to get Apple's OS (Mojave in this case) to adapt to a single SSD. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated - a complete answer so much the better!\n\nA: After a fair amount of research, and with the help of the DriveDx tool I've determined that this \"sudden onset sluggishness\" was caused by a failure (wearout) of the SSD component of Apple's Fusion Drive. FWIW, there's a good summary of the Fusion Drive in the ArchLinux documentation.\nThere are postings on the Internet suggesting that the Fusion Drive was a poorly-executed design; I feel this one explains the situation fairly well. The Fusion Drive was Apple's attempt to create a low-cost, high-performance hybrid drive by pairing a lower cost & performance HDD with a higher cost & performance SSD. Not an inherently bad idea, but Apple executed poorly: they sacrificed service life for additional profit by specifying an SSD that was too-small. The too-small SSD was pounded with write cycles spread over too few memory cells; this resulted in premature death of many Fusion Drives. Mine was almost 5 years old, but very lightly used. Apple no longer produces the Fusion Drive.\nApple made things worse by cutting off logistical support. Fusion Drive repair parts are not available from Apple, and Apple will not accept \"vintage\" models for repair. Even worse, Apple manufactured Fusion Drives over the years with proprietary designs and hardware changes, effectively making 3rd-party solutions unreliable or, for some models, unavailable. On a positive note, it's good to know how Apple operates - you can set your expectations properly.\nIf you're not keen on relegating your over-priced Apple hardware to a landfill, there is some \"good news\" - depending upon which model you have. For iMacs, the IFIXIT website has detailed procedures explaining how to open the iMac housing, and access both the HDD and the SSD.\nBut of course gaining access to the failed parts is only half the battle. The HDD is an industry standard unit with the common SATA interface, but depending upon your model, you may face challenges finding a suitable replacement. I thought I'd found a good option in OWC's \"Aura Pro X2 SSDs\", but arriving at the order page I found a note stating that the Aura Pro devices weren't compatible with my late-2015 iMac:\n\nAn alternative was suggested by the helpful folks at IFIXIT: beetstech sells replacement parts salvaged from other Macs; I've decided on this as the replacement part for my SSD. Contact beetstech directly to find a replacement for your model.\nIn Summary:\nThe Remove & Replace operation for the iMac's Fusion Drive is a rather tedious operation requiring special tools, cutting and replacing adhesive tape, etc. Finding compatible replacement parts may be even more tedious. But it is possible. I'll be sending a thank-you note to Apple when I get this completed - thanking them for showing me that right-to-repair laws may be useful for Apple's former customers.\n", "Q: Invalid fsroot tree, what it really means and file integrity?

According to the documentation for fsck_apfs, exit code 0 means no errors.\n\nI've already looked into third-party tools and there are none that can repair APFS drives.  I've also attempted fsck via the terminal but that results in the exact same error and messages.  There seems to be no way to fix an invalid fsroot except for reformatting the drive.\nI bought another 4 TB drive, formatted it as HFS, and used CCC to clone the \"bad\" APFS drive over and get the machine back into use.   The new HFS drive passes Disk First Aid without errors.\n\n*\n\n*What does the \"invalid nchildren\" error mean?\n\n\n*How do I know CCC copied all my files without corruption?  Since it was apparently operating without issues except for the First Aid error, I have no idea if any files are missing or corrupted.\n\n\n*Is there another way to fix this drive?  No 3rd party utilities can repair, but perhaps through debug mode finding the files that caused the error and restoring or deleting those?\nEDIT:\nRunning fsck_apfs again in debug mode -d.

The inode contains metadata about the object, such as for example when it was created, when it was last modified, how large it is, who owns it, etc.\nAn \"inode_val\" is simply the value (contents) of the inode.\noid\nEach object has a unique number for identification purposes. This is also otherwise referred to as the \"inode number\". In this case the inode number is 3.\nThis is important for you as the number is very low. This usually  means that this was one of the very first files or directories created on the file system.\nThe first inode numbers are assigned as follows:\n  0 = invalid (can't happen)\n  1 = the parent of the \"/\" (root) directory - doesn't really exist\n  2 = the root of the file system (\"/\")\n  3 = the private directory (\"private-dir\")\n  6 = directory for snapshot metadata\n  7 = holder for purgeable files (not an actual directory)\n\nOn a factory default setup, the root of the file system (\"/\") has object id 2.\nIn your case the object has inode number 3. This means that the inode directory represents the special \"private-dir\" directory. This is not to be mistaken with \"/private\" or anything like that.\nThe \"private-dir\" directory is not visible from user space - i.e. programs that you run on your computer cannot see this directory.\nIt is used by file system implementations to hold data that cannot otherwise be represented in the standard file system structure, but needs to be stored on disk. It is not used by Apple.\nIn essence, if for example a Linux implementation of APFS was made, and they needed to store some extra special information about files and directories that is used on Linux, but not on macOS, they could store it here. That way it is stored safely on disk, and Apple's software will know not to mess with it.\nnchildren\nInodes that represent directories have a field name \"nchildren\". Other types of inodes do not have this field, instead they have a field name \"nlinks\". So basically, the existence of the \"nchildren\" means that this particular inode is a directory.\nThe meaning of \"nchildren\" is to record the number of entries in the directory. I.e. if nchildren had the value 8, it would mean there there are 8 files or sub-directories in that directory.\nIn your case the value is -1. This is not valid number, as it does not make sense to have negative 1 files or folders in a directory. The operating system will simply regard that value as invalid and treat it the same as if it had the value 0.\nTo sum this up, there's absolutely nothing practically wrong with your file system. It is just a file system that wasn't created by Apple's standard tool for creating file systems.\nThere's probably a small bug in CCC that made it create the inode with nchildren listed as -1 instead of 0. Apple's fsck tool notes this as an error, but otherwise states that the file system is good. There's no problem in practice.\nYou haven't lost any files or folders, there's not going to be any performance or stability issues in the future. All is good.\n\nA: Backup up files (or using file recovery software) then erasing the drive works in tricky cases where a self diagnosis or self rescue exceed the time you can spend on errors in hardware or file system integrity.\nWith APFS and snapshots, each single snapshot can double the time needed to check and eventually, you may just need to have backups (on more than one disk) and be willing to move on and focus on integrity of files, not expecting bomb-proof filesystems and an fsck that can overcome all errors without data loss.\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2021/03/25/time-machine-to-apfs-maintenance-and-repair/\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2022/05/22/last-week-on-my-mac-will-disk-utility-ever-work-properly/\nMuch of the above blog is in perfect alignment with my and several peer’s perspective and while we delight in some of the advances Apple has made, there are some things we’ve certainly lost as complexity marches on in computing systems. Sometimes, you’re going to have to erase a disk to know if it’s faulty or the accounting got messed up in an unrecoverable manner.\n\nA: Here's a screenshot from a high level user on the Apple forum:\n\nBasically since the exit code is 0 (presumably the reason for the green checkmark and \"operation successful\"), ignore the error... nothing to see here, should have never clicked \"see details\", and move along.\nIt's all just so disappointing and sloppy.\n\nAs far as using APFS on conventional spinning drives... don't.  That seems to be the consensus.\n", "Q: Need to double click everything on my Mac?

Is it possible to let it only index a few? Because I have thousands of folders on my Mac and but I only need to search part of them. In other words, It'd be great to convert the Privacy tab to a Whitelist tab.\n\nA: Spotlight can search for folders. Just write down the exact folder name in the Spotlight search window and, by using the arrow keys, move over to the item matching your search term with the keyword \"Folder\" next to it and press ↵. Then, the folder will be opened in the Finder.\nIf you’d rather open the folder containing the one you are searching for, press Command ⌘+R or Command ⌘+↵ instead.\nIf the folder you are searching for does not show up in the first few Spotlight search results, press Command ⌘+↓ until you end up in the “Folders” category which would display the search results that are folders.\n\nAddition as of September 21, 2022\nThx for updating your OP by including the settings I have asked for in a comment to this answer. However, I don’t know how to directly provide Spotlight a list of folders it should include in its results, i.e. a whitelist. I am not sure if this is possible at all. However, I think I may have a solution that works for you:\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder somewhere that you can remember easily later on such as under your home or the Documents directory.\n\n*Create a shortcut (alias) for each folder you wish to be able to search via Spotlight and move the aliases to the new folder you just created. (See the “Create and remove aliases on Mac” Apple support webpage if you are not familiar with aliases in macOS.)\n\n*Select the Other category in the System Preferences > Spotlight > Search Results window.\n\nIf you do these, you should be able to search for those aliases through Spotlight by typing in their names and still have only a small part (most possibly) of the files on your computer, and none of the folders themselves, show up in Spotlight given your settings. Aliases are indexed for searching by macOS because they are files themselves.\nWhen Spotlight displays one of the aliases you created in a search result, it will just open it in the Finder when you press return after moving over the alias’s name. However, it won’t be showing the folders themselves pointed by the aliases, or the files or folders inside, assuming they do not belong to one of the categories selected in the System Preferences > Spotlight > Search Results window.\nIf including the Other category causes Spotlight to show too many files for your taste, you might be able to alleviate that by excluding one or more high level folders from Spotlight using the System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy window such as the Documents folder under your home directory. Then, of course, the folder containing the aliases should not be placed in the Documents folder.\n", "Q: How to export Logic Pro tracks into an .m4a, .flac, or .mp3 file? It is a bit strange that in the File -> Export of Logic Pro, I can export all tracks into one file, but only as Wav, Aiff, CAF format.\nHowever, I can share to Apple Music, and it will go into the Music app as .m4a\nI can share to SoundCloud, and the upload is quite fast, so I think it is either .m4a or .flac or .mp3. (I just tried downloading my own file, and it was .m4a, but why upload first and download? And SoundCloud sometimes mark our own playing of classical piano music as \"possible infringement of copyright\" and won't include our work in our profile).\nSo how do we just save it as one of .mp3, .flac, or .m4a format without going through Apple Music or SoundCloud?\n\nA: Export is for your master file, not for lossy compressed formats. Save your master as WAV or AIF, then convert for streaming services as a separate step. The two structures also demand different mastering levels. 'CD' can have far higher LUFS values than streaming, so you master first for CD, then pull your levels back to satisfy -14dB LUFS streaming limits & be more careful monitoring for TruePeak levels, which are not so important for WAV as for compressed formats, where they can cause distorted peaks.\n\nA: You can export the track to different codecs by hitting File -> Bounce and select the appropriate options.\n", "Q: Disk Utility Restore from 'Macintosh HD' or 'Macintosh HD - Data'? When cloning an HDD with macOS Catalina Disk Utility's Restore, should I restore from 'Macintosh HD' or 'Macintosh HD - Data'?

There are also the preboot and recovery APFS volumes within the same APFS container. Since the Macintosh HD volume is the root volume when booted to macOS, you should specify this volume when using Disk Utility to restore.\n", "Q: iPad behave like it is low on RAM My iPAD Air (2021) started to behave as if it has low RAM, all apps are reloading after just couple of seconds like if I switch from youtube app to safari after some seconds youtube app will reload completely.

I'm not sure why Mac laptops are like this, but I'm sure there's a reason.\nI'm not convinced that there is a saving to be made by running the battery by day and charging over night, versus leaving it plugged in all the time. Note that it's not actually charging all the time that it's plugged in. Fast-charging from a low-percentage is likely to use much more energy overall.\nApple laptops vary in energy storage between around 50 Watt-hour and 100 Wh batteries. Divide that by the hours of usage, and the rate of power use is well under 10W. Chargers vary between 30W and 140W (though not all of this is used for charging). You can use low-wattage chargers to reduce the maximum power draw, which might reduce your footprint a tiny bit.\nIt will also depend on whether you actually pay less at night for your electricity, of course. Depending on how much you use the laptop, you may run the battery down before the off-peak rate kicks in anyway.\nThe most efficient way to use your laptop in clamshell mode with an external display is to enable sleep, and let the laptop (and display) go into sleep mode when not in use.\n", "Q: Partition type FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF for the primary macOS partition after uninstallation of Ubuntu Linux A few month b ack I installed Ubuntu Linux on my early 2015 MacBookPro, but after not using it for a while I decided to uninstall it.

Microsoft offers free Windows virtual machine images for development. Does Apple have something similar for macOS?\n\nA: Apple publishes all the current beta full installers and there are apps and scripts (including the softwareupdate command line tool that ships with macOS) for anyone to freely download these images for development and testing purposes.\n\n*\n\n*https://twocanoes.com/products/mac/mac-deploy-stick/\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/manage-software-updates-depc4c80847a/web\nYou do need to acquire a license either from the free (or paid) developer programs or one of the free (or institutional) seeding programs.\n\n*\n\n*https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/welcome\n\n*https://appleseed.apple.com/it\n\n*https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/welcome\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/programs/\nMany virtualization systems work from these installers without requiring modification of the Apple installers which are code signed for anti-tampering and security purposes. The Apple “equivalent” of Microsoft’s first party hyper-V virtualization framework has many videos from WWDC and is officially documented online.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization\n\nA: No, Apple only gives access to macOS beta for developers that are parts of the Apple Developer Program (more info about the latest macOS version here and release note of the latest beta as sep. 18 2022).\nDeveloped by Apple and free on the App Store, Xcode :\n\nincludes everything you need to develop, test, and distribute apps\nacross all Apple platforms.\n\n\nA: There is a nice utility on linux for this called quickemu: https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu\nIt does require some knowledge of running linux but if you have a spare computer, you could install something like Ubuntu and use this utility to spin up a VM.\n", "Q: Disk utility volume button is greyed out I want to store Time Machine backups and backup other files on an external SSD. Upon backing up Time Machine, it doesn't allow me to store any other files on the SSD. I found out that a new partition or volume must be created so that both can be stored. However, I heard that adding a volume is preferable to adding a partition since volumes share space. My problem is that the add volume button is greyed out in Disk Utility. How do I fix this? I already tried running First Aid but it didn't change anything.\n\nA: Add will be disabled if you have selected the physical disk. Select the container disk or the existing TM volume instead (assuming the disk is APFS formatted) and you will be able to add another volume alongside in the same container. As you are aware, they will share the free space in the container and this will affect the TM housekeeping and retentions over time.\nEnsure View | Show All Devices is selected to show the container disk. Then Cmd-Click on the container disk underneath the physical disk and Add APFS Volume... The other alternative is to click + Volume in the toolbar. If your TM volume is encrypted, then this will not apply to your new volume, and you'll need to specify APFS Encrypted if you need to in the resulting dialog.\nAlso worth checking is that the added volume appears automatically in the Time Machine exclusions. Otherwise it will be doing a backup from one vol to another.\nTested on macOS 12.6\n", "Q: How do I make FontBook display a preview of the fonts which show up as a boxed question marks? In FontBook, a lot of my installed fonts display as a boxed question mark.\nHow do I resolve this issue?\nmacOS High Sierra\n\n\nA: The 'question mark in a box' glyph shows that the glyphs are missing from that font.\nFirst, make sure that the preview text has not been altered to something outside the range of that font. (It's usually the pangram 'The quick brown fox...', but it may be possible to change it.)\nIf you think that the font does, or should contain those glyphs, check that you can access them in a text app.\nIt's possible the font cache has got corrupted. You can empty the font cache by booting to Safe Boot mode (hold down SHIFT at restart), and then restart normally.\nSome third-party fonts don't always work properly, and cause oddities in terms of naming, grouping,  and other issues, if they haven't been created entirely properly.\n", "Q: \"pmset\" values changed after system update and started battery drain I had Monterey 12.5 (21G72) and

any clues to help sort this problem out and stop the drain?\n\nA: There don't seem to be major changes in your list, though two that standout to me are proximitywake and powernap. On my 2016 MacBook the settings did not change for any of the Monterey updates.\nSome of the settings can be changed in System Preferences > Battery. That includes PowerNap and Display Sleep.\nWhere settings can't be changed via System Preferences, they can be changed with the pmset command, for example:\nsudo pmset -b proximitywake 0\nThat should allow you to set things back how to what they were before.\nPeople have differing views on good values for the settings and that can vary on different Mac models. I will venture some comments on your settings which could lead to better battery life whilst sleeping:\n\n*\n\n*I prefer smaller values for the two standbydelays which are in seconds. This is to speed up the transition into deeper sleep modes.\n\n*A non-zero value for tcpkeepalive means that the Mac keeps on waking for network traffic. The same applies to womp though I don't have that on my MacBook.\n\nFor comparison, with my underpowered 2016 MacBook I have these values:\n lidwake              1\n autopoweroff         1\n standbydelayhigh     7200\n autopoweroffdelay    14400\n standbydelaylow      7200\n standby              1\n proximitywake        0\n ttyskeepawake        1\n hibernatemode        3\n powernap             0\n gpuswitch            2\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n highstandbythreshold 50\n displaysleep         4\n sleep                1\n acwake               0\n halfdim              1\n tcpkeepalive         0\n disksleep            1\n\nMy MacBook sleeps happily with only 1 or 2 percent drop in battery level next day. If I were to change anything it would be to reduce the delays to 1 hour (3600 seconds).\n", "Q: How to reset an app's settings on Mac How to reset an app's settings on Mac?\nfor example on GNU/Linux I just delete say .firexox and Firefox \"Loses memory\" just like it has been just installed.\nI remember there was an option to clean storage on iPhone too.\nBut how to reset all the storage for an app in a Macbook?\n\nA: This will depend on how the app was installed.\nIf it was a simple drag and drop from a disk image file, then by far the simplest method is to use something like AppCleaner (Freeware)\nDrop the app onto it, then uncheck the app itself. Let it delete all the ancillary files.\nThis will mean at next launch, the app is 'clean'.\nFor any app that was installed by running an install package, you will probably need to find its uninstaller & run that to completely delete everything. Then run the installer once more.\n\nA: Most app 'settings' are user data, and thus stored in the user's Library folder.\nThe usual files to look for are in the Preferences sub-folder: these are usually in the form of com.company.appname.plist. More complex apps might have a sub-folder with their name, and files inside.\nOther places to look are in the Application Support sub-folder. There would then be a sub-folder with the application's name (or company's name), and files inside.\nSandboxing both complicates and simplifies things somewhat, as sandboxed apps will have all their data inside the Containers sub-folder, e.g. ~/Library/Containers/MyAppName/Data/Library/Preferences\nSimply deleting the 'MyAppName' folder will delete all the data of a sandboxed app. This is what happens on iOS, where all apps are sandboxed.\nThere may also be cache files inside the Caches sub-folder.\nSo-called 'cleaning' apps will do nothing more than search for files with the name of your app inside the user Library and delete them, in the hope that it's not deleting something it shouldn't, and isn't missing anything it should.\n", "Q: When pasting in Terminal.app, `00~` is pasted at the start and `01~` at the end When pasting in Terminal.app, 00~ is pasted at the start and 01~ at the end. So when I want to paste /some/path, I actually get 00~/some/path01~. Also an audible sound is heard twice, so probably ^G (ASCII BELL) is also inserted at the start and end of the pasted text.\nWhen I paste the same in an editor, this behaviour is not happening (only /some/path gets pasted).\nThis happens with all text.\nWhen I stop and start Terminal.app, the behaviour also disappears. But after a while, it is back again.\nAny ideas as to what this behaviour is causing?\n\nA: This is technically a feature.\nModern terminals (Terminal.app, iTerm2.app) keep track of your output. For example if you type a 200 character command into a shell, it knows that is one \"line\". Should you copy it, there is an attempt to maintain that as one line with no additional newlines (\\n) in the middle.\niTerm2 has a FAQ on this subject under this question:\n\n\"Q: When I paste I get funny characters before and after the pasted text, like 0~ and 1~.\"\n\nYou see the extra characters bracketing pastes when the terminal and the remote site get out of sync with each other. This most commonly happens when you lose your ssh connection or when the editor crashes. Resetting the terminal app can turn paste bracketing off again.\nI'm often reminded of the good old days when this feature wasn't turned on. But it also had it's issues with extra newlines in pastes and indention issues.\n\nA: Short answer: Run the command printf '\\e[?2004l'. This sends an escape sequence to the terminal that tells it to stop sending bracketed paste sequences.\nOther options: In Terminal.app, you can also reset it with Command-Option-R (or Shell menu > Reset). In iTerm2.app, it's Command-R or Session menu > Reset. In either app, this also resets a number of other weird modes it might get into, which can be handy.\nYou can also mostly eliminate the problem by either switching your interactive shell to zsh, or installing a newer version of bash (at least v5.1) and switching to that. These use and understand bracketed pastes, and also reset it before each command, so it can't get stuck on (well, past the current command anyway).\nLong answer: \"Bracketed pastes\" are a feature that lets the terminal notify the various programs running in the terminal when data is being pasted (as opposed to being typed in like normal). Basically, it sends special \"beginning of paste\" and \"end of paste\" escape sequences (\\e[200~ and \\e[201~ respectively, where \\e represents an ASCII escape character). This is so that, for example, the program can treat a pasted multiline document as a single item rather than seeing each line as a separate item. I also have some shell scripts that use it so they can accept a drag-and-dropped item without my having to switch to the terminal window and hit return to indicate the item's complete.\nGenerally, when a program understands these sequences and wants to receive them, it'll send another escape sequence to the terminal (\\e[?2004h) to tell it to start sending them. It should send another sequence to turn them off (\\e[?2004l) when it exits, but if fails to do that, gets disconnected without exiting cleanly, or some other program runs inside of it, or... then you get these sequences being sent to a program that has no idea what they are, and just interprets them as gibberish.\nzsh and bash v5.1+ use bracketed paste mode themselves, and therefore 1) don't get confused by the escape sequences, and 2) send the sequence to turn bracketed paste off every time you run another program (/command) and the sequence to turn it back on after each program exits, so it's constantly getting reset to the right state.\n(The situation with bash is a bit complicated. macOS only includes bash v3.2.57 by default. Support for bracketed paste was added in v4.4 (with readline 7.0), but seems to be off by default until v5.1. So if you install bash v5.1 or later, and use that as your interactive shell, you shouldn't have trouble with this.)\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) and dual 27inch 4k monitor setup I will be using the MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) with the Apple M1 Pro 10 core CPU, 16 core GPU mostly for programming(python, machine learning, deep learning and docker) and davinci resolve(only for video editing). I have read a lot of articles online. some said that only 1440p or 5k must be used for a 27” monitor, while some said that 4K can be used, but only after sacrificing a significant amount of CPU/GPU power for scaling for the unsupported PPI, while some other articles mentions that third party tools can be used for proper scaling.\nSo, I would like to know, from the community, how to go about this?\nI need a 4K monitor(not other resolution), but can’t afford LG Ultrafine 5K(couldn’t find other 5K monitors) at this moment!. and anything above 27inch would be too big.\n\nA: This has been a misunderstanding from the beginning. You first mentioned a M1 MacBookPro which has been sold by Apple over the last two years. I have written my answer in belief that you are using that model, however, now you updated the question and you are using a M1 Pro MacBook Pro 14\", which is a different chip and therefore supports more displays!\nM1 Pro MacBook Pro\nThe M1 Pro chip supports two external screens, each at a resolution of up to 6K@60Hz. For full details view the Apple spec sheet.\nM1 (without Pro or Max) MacBook Air/Pro\nThe M1 chip only supports one single external display with a resolution of 6K@60Hz. For example, see the details for the (old) M1 MBP 13\".\n\nGenerally any connected screen will take some hit on the performance, but it is such a minor performance drawback that IMO it is always better to have more screen real estate. However, when you need more external displays than whats supported out of the box you can use DisplayLink. You will end up with a higher CPU/GPU load though, which can also vary a lot depending on what you are doing.\nI can't give much advice on scaling - I have not tried around too much, but for me the usage (when I had been using DisplayLink) was ok, usually below 10%. However, this also depends on what you are doing (dragging windows around is harder than just writing some text in Word/VSCode). IMO I would just try it out, since this depends on so many devices in your setup it is hard to give exact numbers. Similar things have been reported in the DisplayLink forum.\n\nA: CPU and GPU always go up when you push pixels. The question is balance and expectations. I’ve not had any bad interactions with the LG 5K and 4K displays sold through Apple.\nOther than appropriate and manageable ghosting on the panels (burn in that’s normal and expected on mid to high quality LCD) there have been no issues with several  of Mac hardware up to and including M2 lineup.\nIf you are making money with your time or computer, avoid DisplayLink entirely.\n\n*\n\n*https://store.apple.com/xc/product/HMUA2VC/A\nThey aren’t as high quality or feature full as Apple displays, but they are very good for pro use IMHO.\n\nA: Since you plan to use the setup for writing a lot a code I highly recommend you to stick with 1440p display since macOS scaling does not work correctly with 4K and you will never get a pixel-perfect scaled display output on 4K display (and native 4K will be too small for code). For in-depth explanation regarding this issue and please refer to this article (contains list of HiDPI displays that may be used with macOS scaling, i.e. Dell UP2715K) and this video (for a perfect example).\nP.S. Believe me your eyes will hurt on 4K because image will be slightly blurry when macOS scaling is on. Don't waste your time and money with 4K.\n", "Q: Error updating Monterey \"An error occurred migrating user data during an install. Reinstall macOS\" loop I'm having trouble updating Monterey for the last 2 updates. When I do it restarts in recovery saying:\n\"Your computer started up in Recovery because a failure occurred during installation. An error occurred migrating user data during an install. Reinstall macOS to resolve the issue\".\nReinstall macOS does not solve the issue. The only way I found to fix the issue (update before this one) is by wiping my macOS partition clean and then reinstall the macOS. Unfortunately, because I have a third party SSD on my MBP, that would not work unless I replaced the SSD with an official Apple SSD, upgrade to the latest version, then swap it back with my third party SSD, do a clean install, and restore my backups. Needless to say, this is super painful and I'd really rather not do that.\nHas anyone had the same problem?

I have a MacBook Air 2019 laptop and I got a Dell monitor 24 inches (with VGA and DVI).\nI bought a Thunderbolt video adaptor:\n\n... connected it with a DVI cable and it worked perfectly. I can work with my laptop screen and the monitor.\nNow I am going to buy another monitor and I have doubts:\n\n*\n\n*Main question: If I buy a new monitor and connect it via HDMI or VGA... will it work? (Does MacBook 2019 support 2 extra monitors?)\n\n*How can I know if a monitor supports Thunderbolt?\n\n*If I bought a third extra monitor, will all (laptop + 3 extras) work?\n\n*Do I need to have more cables?\n\n\nA: The product description says it will not support more than one display at a time. That is pretty much that.\nTaking this a bit further we can look into Apple multiple display support and find that Apple (in)famously does not support MST on DisplayPort, meaning no one port is going to support more than one display.\nIf someone were to plug an external GPU into a Thunderbolt port then the number of displays supported depends on the capability of this added GPU, not that internal to the Mac.  I’ve seen external GPUs that will support three displays but they sell for far more than 13 euro.\nWith Apple computers it is one display to one port.  Adding a GPU to a port can be considered an exception to this rule but that is because the GPU in the Mac isn’t driving the display any more but the external box.\nHow can someone know if a display supports Thunderbolt?  You need to examine the spec sheet.  Thunderbolt displays are a bit rare so if that is a feature then it should not be difficult to find as it would be a selling point.\nI’m debating on if I should give examples on what is needed to get more displays to work as that might be considered a product endorsement.  If you want three displays from one port then look for an external graphics processor unit, they will look much like a USB-C dock with USB, video, and other ports but it will state in the specification sheet how many displays it will support and cost more than just an average dock.\n\nA: I can't give you a full answer, but still this may help:\n\nIf I buy a new monitor and connect it via HDMI or VGA... will it work? (Does MacBook 2019 support 2 extra monitors?)\n\nThis is actually two questions: Yes, the MBA supports two external displays up to 4K@60Hz. However, I very much doubt, that this adaptor can support two monitors at the same time. It may be able to mirror the same image to both external monitors, but most likely it is unable to extend both screens. I can't be sure though, since the description and its reviews are all in spanish and even DeepL/Google translate fail to translate the important details.\n\nHow can I know if a monitor supports Thunderbolt?\n\nIt should be clearly stated that a monitor supports Thunderbolt (TB) somewhere in the descirption (but those are rare, especially with TB 3/4 and USB3/4 nowadays. However, be careful: The TB 2 connector looks the same as the mini-DP connector, yet mini-DP is only for video transfer, while TB 2 includes the mini-DP protocol amongst others. And to complicate things further: TB 3 and so on have a different connector (the USB-C connector), however TB 3 ≠ USB 3 type C.\n\nIf I bought a third extra monitor, will all (laptop + 3 extras) work?\n\nIt does not. Neither does the MBA support three external screen nor will the adaptor be able to handle three monitors at the same time.\n", "Q: What do the symbols next to windows listed in an apps menu indicate?

Think dog leash, flashlight, hot tea, warming in pocket, etc.\nWill the Apple Watch still be able to count steps with some accuracy? Or is that an unreasonable expectation when my arm is not swinging in stride?\n\nA: Yes, the Apple Watch will still count steps in those circumstances. Even though you're carrying a flash light or you have your hands in your pockets, you're still moving about - and the accelerometer in the watch will be able to detect footfalls and consequently steps.\nThere are some cases where the Apple Watch doesn't count steps, or have a really hard time counting accurately. For example if you're walking with a pram or stroller, where your hands are resting on the handle, which will minimize any input to the accelerometer from your walking.\nIn general, I would recommend that you calibrate your Apple Watch to suit the way you take your walks/runs. Follow Apple's instructions here for calibration:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204516\nThe steps are:\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone, open the Settings app\n\n\n*Tap Privacy > Location Services\n\n\n*Make sure that Location Services is turned on\n\n\n*Scroll down, then tap System Services\n\n\n*Make sure that Motion Calibration & Distance is turned on\n\n\n*On your Apple Watch, go to a flat, open outdoor area that offers good GPS reception\n\n\n*Open the Workout app. To start, tap Outdoor Walk or Outdoor Run\n\n\n*Walk or run at your normal pace for about 20 minutes\n", "Q: Is any metadata or image/video quality lost when exporting? I have a bunch of random photos and videos that I don't want to clutter up my iPhone and iCloud account.\nOn my Mac, in the Photos app, I have tried using the \"File\"->\"Export\"->\"Export Unmodified Originals\" menu.\nIs this the best way to move the images/videos out of the iPhone/iCloud and onto an external drive connected to my Mac?\nIn particular, I'm worried about losing metadata or image/video quality.\nI noticed that the dates on the files that I tried exporting aren't set correctly, which is an inconvenience. I can, however, see the correct dates when browsing in Adobe Bridge. I assume this is because Bridge is using the EXIF date and not the file's modified date.\nMaybe I'm going about this entirely wrong. It can't be normal for people to keep decades of photos and videos all in iCloud, can it? In an ideal world, I would like to browse through/manage everything using the Photos app on my Mac, including using the Photos app to  browse content I've offloaded to external storage.\n\nA: I am assuming that you are exporting to a folder in a file system fully supported by macOS - e.g. APFS. If you export to another file system, then some of that below may be wrong!\nAs you are already using, \"File\"->\"Export\"->\"Export Unmodified Originals\"  is the best way to export unmodified images and videos.\nImages are exported without modification. So EXIF data (which is inside the image file) is maintained. There is no loss of either EXIF metadata or image quality.\nAFAIK, the same is true of videos.\nWhen the file is created (outside Photos), the creation and modification dates of the file are set from the EXIF metadata. So those dates should be as you expect. Check these in Finder. You should not need to use Adobe Bridge though that will directly read the EXIF metadata.\n\"File added\" date shown by Finder will always be when the file is added to the folder in the file system.\nIn addition the EXIF data will be used when Spotlight indexes the file.\nWhat you will lose is metadata belonging to Photos app. As examples: Photos detects faces - this information is not exported as it is not part of the image file. You may have added keywords in Photos - these are not exported in an \"unmodified\" export.\nYour subsidiary question about normal people: Yes, there are people who keep decades of photos in Photos app and iCloud. As an example of why, it makes it easy to view all their old scanned photos on their iPhone. Maybe not common, but definitely people who have thought about ways to take advantage of iCloud/Photos.\nPersonally I use Adobe Lightroom as my prime photo management app, but it is only the \"Development\" features that keep me using it.\n", "Q: MBP 2019 13\" 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports (electric ESC button) A novice here.

You will need the firmware password to set rEFInd as the default to boot on startup from the Mac Startup Manager. Afterwards, your Mac will boot to rEFInd, where any user can then select macOS or Windows.\nYou can install rEFInd directly from macOS without have to disable SIP or from Windows.

To do this, your Linux will need to be installed to BIOS boot.\nYou should be aware of the following.\n\n*\n\n*Many early Intel Macs needed a firmware update before being able to BIOS boot.\n\n*Your Mac can only BIOS boot from the internal optical drive or HDD. Your Mac can only 32 bit EFI boot from the USB ports.\n\n*Your Mac can only boot from the optical drive if the DVD has only one boot method. For example, if the DVD is capable of both BIOS and 32 bit EFI booting, then the DVD will not be bootable on your Mac.\n\nThis answer outlines the instructions for installing a 64 bit Debian Linux on a Mac with a 32 bit EFI. The basic steps are outlined below.\n\n*\n\n*From an USB port on the Mac, 32 bit EFI boot a 32 bit Debian installer.\n\n*Install a 32 bit Debian to BIOS boot.\n\n*Copy a 64 bit Debian installer to the internal drive.\n\n*Use the Grub from the 32 bit BIOS booting Debian to BIOS boot the 64 bit Debian installer.\n\n*Replace the 32 bit BIOS booting Debian with a 64 bit BIOS booting Debian.\n\nIn many cases, you can install a different 64 bit Linux by substituting some other 64 bit Linux installer.\n\nHere is another answer where a Windows/Kubuntu dual boot is installed. Here, DVDs are used instead of an USB flash drive.\n", "Q: Create partition for MacOS installation I was playing around with Asahi Linux and want to reinstall MacOS in the whole disk again. I ended up deleting all volumes/partitions (not sure what term is correct here). How I have access to recovery but in the option to reinstall MacOS no volume candidate appears for installation. Here's what diskutil list looks like\n\nAs you can see there is free space (494GB) but I couldn't figure out the commands to set up this space for the new OS install.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It is simple, one command:\ndiskutil addpartition disk0s1 apfs macOS 0\n\nAfter this command, the 494GB APFS Volume should pop up in the Disk Utility.\n", "Q: How can I secure my mac when downloading a file? I am a developer & ASO specialist. As you guess, I have different customers. I am downloading 5-10 files per day from my customers.\nI learned that it is possible to hack MacOS via mp4, apk files, txt files, images, etc. but my customers always send their apks, app images, txt files, app videos(mp4), etc.\nOnly 10-15 percentage of customers are my previous & reliable customers. Remains are new customers and I have no idea their files are safe or not, they may want to hack my computer or log my works to steal my approach, etc.\nFinally, How do I know if a file is 100% reliable, before opening it?\nIs there any solution for this problem? (any secure mac app, etc.)\nI'm using virustotal but I have no idea that I am safe or not.\nThanks...\n\nA: Saying that \"it's possible to hack macOS via mp4\" is oversimplifying what happens.\nIt's extremely rare that the file is actually an mp4 - what's more common is it's a program disguised as an mp4, and the user clicks through the warnings when they try to open it. Alternatively, people are told to download a program to view the \"mp4\" but the mp4 is completely fake and has no contents.\nWhen you receive a file from an untrusted source, you can do a few things to verify that it is not an executable program file:\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that Finder > Settings (Preferences) > Advanced > Show all filename extensions is enabled. This will ensure that you don't receive a file named abc.mp4.app and miss the .app extension.\n\n*If you receive an alert when opening a file that you expect to just contain media, read it carefully. If it seems like the alert is warning you that you might be running something, cancel and re-examine the file.\n\n*If you are dealing with data that is likely to be malicious (which is very different), you should set up a virtual machine and open the files in this virtual machine.\n\n\nOn macOS, most executable / \"runnable\" files are .app application bundles. These can be run by double-clicking them. However, also be aware of things like .command or even files with no extension. These files will still be marked as executable and will be quarantined (meaning you will see an alert before opening them the first time).\nExamples of files that are executable/\"runnable\". For each of these, the type is described as an \"application,\" \"script,\" or \"executable\".\n\nFurthermore, if you download files like these and open them, you'll see an alert like this the first time you run it:\n\n", "Q: Offline iCloud backups I’m a heavy user of iCloud Drive to synchronise my files across my iOS and Mac devices. It works well, but I’d also like to have an automatic way to maintain offline backups of my iCloud data. This is partially to not be dependent on Apple's servers but also to have backups of iCloud in case I delete something accidentally and it gets removed everywhere.\nSince iCloud is only available on Mac, I have an old Mac Mini acts as a server and continuously sync with iCloud and back it self up every hour using time machine. This way (in an ideal world) I’d have hourly time machine backs up of my iCloud Drive and photo library without intervention. That’s way I can make a change on my phone and it automatically gets synced via iCloud and backed up offline by the mac mini.\nCurrently I have optimised storage disabled on the Mac mini so that it stores everything locally. However the Mac mini frequently doesn’t sync. For example the photo library only syncs when the Photos app is open and sometimes files aren't synced until I actually manually take a look at them. Is there a way to, on a regular schedule, or even better programatically, force iCloud to sync? I know there isn't an official feature but I'm looking for a kludge like keeping Photos app open or iterating through the files?\nOr perhaps a better idea to automatically make offline backups of iCloud all-together?\n\nA: This is what I use on my always running iMac (more of an anecdote than answer) and I am splitting it into iCloud Drive and Photos which are stored very differently.\nLike you, I do not use optimised storage.\niCloud and iCloud Drive which, as far as I can tell, does get downloaded in the background. This maybe because a) I regularly access it with TM and Carbon Copy Cloner, and b) is is only a few GBytes.\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine.\n\n\n*Scheduled synchronisation of ~/Library/Mobile Documents to an external disk. Currently I am using CCC for this, but have also used Chronosync.\n\n\n*The destination folder of #2 is also a source for Arq Backup to B2 cloud storage - this gives me daily history as well as current state.\nThe above is surely overkill, but better safe than sorry. :)\nFor Photos:\n\n*\n\n*Carbon Copy Cloner is scheduled to backup photos libraries to a destination APFS volume with snapshots. So just like TM, but with more control over scheduling and history kept.\n\n\n*Arq Backup (scheduled daily) directly sends the photo libraries to B2 cloud. Again lots of history.\nMost of the time, Photos app does not need to be kept open to ensure that the Photos 'system library' is up to date. But it may need kicking to get it started. On a 'server' Mac (like yours) it is perhaps best to keep the Photos app open and connected to the 'system library'.\n", "Q: How to fix borked Xcode Commandline Tools? For some reason my MacBook is constantly complaining that it needs to install Xcode tools, even if I just installed them seconds before.\n\nIf I hit \"Cancel\", the same dialog box can reappear in a matter of seconds.  (This is effectively Apple DDOSing my brain, but that's a tangential problem.)  If I hit \"Install\" (even though I know it won't work) it start out telling me that it will take some ridiculously long time like 111 hours,\n\nand eventually it will finish in perhaps 20 minutes.  But it will inevitably return, usually seconds later.\nI can look at System Preferences and sometimes it will also say I have updates waiting:\n\nBut this never solves the problem either.\n\nAfter hitting \"Ok\", it might even momentarily act like everything is fine:\n\nBut the problem always returns.\nI'm on 12.6 (21G115).\nAnd yes, I've tried rebooting.\n\nA: TLDR\njust open Xcode if you have it, and let it complete the installation.\nFull Answer\nEven though I don't use Xcode itself at all and only installed it for the command line tools for other apps that use them, it seems that Apple cannot conceive of this situation, and they don't actually complete the installation until you open Xcode ‍♂️\nSo if you have the full Xcode, the dialogs that claim to update the command line tools are lying to you.  You must open Xcode itself before the update finishes.\n\nA: I encountered this.\nI fixed it by Uninstalling the Command Line Tools\nThe reinstalling them from the Apple Developer Downloads\nSimples\n\nA: Here's what's worked for me. It's unclear what steps are optional or not, since I've tried so many combinations:\n\n*\n\n*Reset Xcode command line tools: sudo xcode-select --reset, then sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\n\n*Uninstall Xcode.\n\n*Re-install Xcode command line tools with sudo xcode-select --install.\n\n*While it is installing, go to Systems Preferences and install those 3 updates. Do not close the Xcode command line tools install window while the Systems Preferences does its installing (even if the other window says the install failed), otherwise both will fail. Why does this work? Who knows, Apple writes spaghetti code.\n\nVoila.\n", "Q: Can't disable System Integrity Protection for auxiliary systems on my Apple Silicon mac: \"recovery system is not paired with the required volume\" I have an M1 Mac Mini with three macOS systems installed within the same APFS container on the internal drive: Big Sur, Monterey, and the latest Ventura beta.\nIf I boot into the recovery environment, open terminal and use csrutil disable to disable System Integrity Protection on my main system, the Monterey system, it works fine. However, if I try to disable SIP for either the Big Sur or Ventura systems, I get the following error:\ncsrutil: The current recovery system is not paired with the requested volume \"[volume UUID]\"\nEnsure that the booted recovery system matches the main system that is being modified.\n\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: You must load the correct recovery system for its respective volume.\nIf you have three systems installed you will have three recovery volumes installed so you must boot from the respective recovery system.\nSource: Apple Platform Security: Paired recoveryOS restrictions\n", "Q: Get an application, to ask for automation permissions? \nHow can I force an app to ask for automation permissions? \nSo that I can make it have permissions to access documents and data in safari.\nLike this \nBut for safari.\n\nA: You can't manually 'force' one app to control another: Safari has to allow the control, and Cubox Helper needs to ask for it.\nIt's possible that Safari's security prevents access; it might be that Cubox needs to support Safari.\nAsk the developer if it's possible.\n", "Q: How do I mount iCloud photos on my Mac? I have gobs of photos in iCloud, automatically uploaded from two different phones.  Most/all of them are redundant, as I've also imported them into Photos on my Mac.  I need the iCloud space to back up those phones.  I feel certain it should be possible to mount the iCloud storage as a virtual drive from my Mac, or access my iCloud photo storage from Photos, so that I can check the photos are duplicates and delete them, or download any I don't already have on the computer — and delete them.\nBut the photos don't appear under iCloud in Finder.  I tried enabling Photos under iCloud in Settings, thinking that might let the iCloud photos show up in Photos, but evidently that tries to sync my local photo library up to iCloud, which of course fails because iCloud is full.\nI've read I should be able to access the photos by going to icloud.com with a browser, but that doesn't seem to be working, either.\nI know I could pay to get more iCloud storage, but I don't want to do that, because I have no desire or need to keep all those photos in iCloud anyway.\n\nUpdate: Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way.  I eventually managed to get in to iCloud.com, and I see that if I delete photos there, it's also going to insist on deleting them from all devices, which is not what I want.  I guess I have to tell my phones to stop synching photos to iCloud, and then maybe worry about expediting their deletion from iCloud.  [But I'm having trouble doing that, too.]\n\nA: \nbut evidently that tries to sync my local photo library up to iCloud, which of course fails because iCloud is full.\nI know I could pay to get more iCloud storage, but I don't want to do that, because I have no desire or need to keep all those photos in iCloud anyway.\n\nAssuming that\n\n*\n\n*all your iPhones have sync with iCloud photos turned on,\n\n*and Photos.app on mac has sync with iCloud turned off,\n\nif you only use iPhones for shooting and do not need to access all your photos on iPhones, then you can download all photos of iCloud with third party tools.\nAfter downloading those photos, you can make backups of them and import them into Photos.app on Mac.\nThen you can delete all already downloaded photos from iCloud (either via browser or iPhone), making room for photos taken on your iPhones in the future.\nThis way, iCloud is used as a cache to upload new photos taken on iPhones to mac, and for reducing the risk of photo lost if your iPhone get stolen or broken before photos imported to Mac, but not for storing all your photos.\nThus, the free quota should be sufficient.\nThe downside is you cannot access all your photos on iPhones through iCloud.\nYou can only access recent photos not imported to Mac yet.\nYou can access all your photos on iPhones via other means, for example, Dropbox or your own NAS.\nIf you choose to build your own NAS, then you may consider using Nextcloud, which is open source and supports live photos.\n", "Q: Can I charge my iPhone 13 with the Power brick from my Macbook M1 Air (2020)? So, I got a 30W charger with my M1 Macbook Air. Can I use it to charge my iPhone 13 without affecting its battery health more negatively, or I should go for a 12, or 20W charger?\nAlso, are there any charging tips to prolong the battery life? Like I should only charge to 80%, not charge it overnight, or it doesn't really matter.\n\nA: Yes, you can use a higher-rated charger with an iPhone.  Energy isn't 'pushed' into the phone, the phone takes what it needs. The rating is the maximum that the charger can provide.\nAs for prolonging the battery life: Apple has teams of engineers working on the software that manages the battery. There are algorithms that analyse your usage, and charge the battery accordingly. The \"Optimize Battery Charging\" setting already delays charging above 80%, if that fits your usage.\nI'd say use it as you need. Because you want to have a phone you can use as you need, not one that you have to modify your behaviour for. Chances are, the phone's battery will last for three years or so -- whatever you do -- before you either replace the battery, or get a new phone.\n", "Q: Using system_profiler with English output on German macOS For a macOS software that works with fonts on the bash shell I need information about the installed fonts.\nTo get the font information I use\nsystem_profiler SPFontsDataType\n\nThis works fine on an English macOS.\nHowever when run on a German macOS it outputs everything in English, except the font style.\nAnd for compatibility I also need the font style in English.\nExample German macOS:\nFull Name: Times New Roman Fett\nFamily: Times New Roman\nStyle: Fett\n\nExample English macOS:\nFull Name: Times New Roman Bold\nFamily: Times New Roman\nStyle: Bold\n\nI tried to set to change AppleLanguages in the defaults for system_profiler, but it didn't work.

I understand it with the iPhone SE because it would add waterproofing. But the MacBook isn't actually waterproof. So what is the benefit? And isn't it another electrical component to burn out or malfunction?\n\nA: The trackpad provides feedback in other situations than clicks. For example, when moving tables about in Numbers using the trackpad, you will feel clicks as the tables are aligned, and so you know when to let go. There are many other examples of where such alignment indication is useful, say in drawing apps.\nAlso, I'd imagine some games make use of it too.\nTo single out one minor component for potential failure is a bit extreme compared to all the rest of the complexity of a modern MacBook. Indeed the most common formerly vulnerable mechanism, the hard disk, has now largely been replaced by SSDs. All that's left now is to find a solid-state method of moving air across heatsinks for the more powerful systems. Even that is being addressed with low power designs removing the need for fans in your aforementioned M2 MBA.\nIf the trackpad click fails, it's nowhere near as serious as a mechanical disk or fan failure.\n\nA: One reason is to support Force Click, which responds with a second click if you apply further pressure.\nI don't know whether it would be possible to implement this with physical switches, but if so, it would probably be pretty complex. And that wouldn't allow Force Click to be disabled (which you can do from System Preferences→Trackpad).\nImplementing the click ‘in software’ is much more flexible, and also allows other forms of haptic feedback, such as letting you feel when objects are aligned. And Apple are apparently investigating using it to provide further types of feedback in future.\n", "Q: What happens if you plug an iPod into a USBC iPad? What happens if you plug an iPod into a USBC iPad?\nSome people don't have laptops. Could they use their USBC iPads to manage their more portable music players?\n\nA: Nothing bad happens - i.e. the units won't blow up or anything like that.\nBut you will not be able to manage the iPod from the iPad, so you cannot sync an iPod from an iPad.\n", "Q: How to disconnect iCloud photo storage, without losing all my photos? This is probably a duplicate, and if so I apologize.\nRight now my phones aren't backing up because my free 5 Gigabyte iCloud account is completely full of pictures.  I need to upgrade a phone, and that requires a working backup of the old one, so the situation is now critical.\nI think I just want to disable iCloud photo storage on both phones.  But when I try to turn off \"iCloud Photos\", I get a prompt saying\n\nDo you want to download a copy of your iCloud Photos to this iPhone?\n\nNo, I don't.  but I have two choices:\n\nRemove from iPhone\n\nNo, I don't want to remove anything from this phone, except the connection that's also uploading everything to iCloud.\n\nDownload Photos & Videos\n\nNo, I don't want to download anything to this phone.  Every picture I've taken on this phone is also downloaded to my Mac for long-term storage.\nI tried choosing \"Remove from iPhone\" anyway, and it gives me a confirmation saying:\n\n898 photos and videos will be removed from this iPhone. These photos and videos will remain in iCloud Photos.\n\nNo! No, no, no!  That's the opposite of what I want!  I want to keep them on the phone and delete them from iCloud!  How do I do that?\n(Am I reading that message correctly?  While turning off the sync-with-iCloud feature, it's really going to delete the copies -- which in my case are the originals -- from the phone?)\nI've read this question which seems to match mine, but I think its answer is out of date, as I can't find the dialog it references on my phone.\n\nA: Maintaining the Status Quo in a manageable way\nI think your options boil down to either buying more space (even a very usable 50GB only costs me 79p a month) for longer term flexibility or managing your photos thru your macOS iCloud Photos Library to reduce your cloud usage.\nThis can be done by exporting originals as you are currently doing, or by the use of a 3rd party utility such as PowerPhotos to export to a non-iCloud Photos library on your Mac. You can then delete them from the macOS iCloud Photos library and the deletes will propagate up to iCloud. Or as nohillside originally pointed out, they can be deleted through the iCloud Photos website. In both cases, make sure that Recently Deleted is cleared out once you're sure.\nAnd of course, as has just been pointed out, iCloud storage should not be treated as a backup, so a reliable Time Machine backup of your Mac will also be a good idea.\nAs for the phone restoration issue, a new phone can be restored over a local Bluetooth connection from and old one. See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210216\nSevering phone and iCloud photos\nIf you make sure you have all the iCloud photos synced to the phone before switching off Settings | Photos | iCloud Photos, then it will not prompt you re. downloading when you do, and all the photos remain on the phone. Similarly if you do the same in macOS Photos, then the photos remain on the Mac.\nWhat it's actually doing, even though it isn't particularly clear, is asking you how attached you are to the photos on your phone. If you want to keep them, then it knows that low-quality space savers may be present on the phone, and it is ensuring that the originals get downloaded to the phone.. Or if you aren't bothered, it asks permission to get rid completely.\nManaging photos in iCloud is completely separate to that above. To remove the photos from iCloud but leave on your phone:\n\n*\n\n*On the Mac: Photos | Preferences | iCloud | Download Originals to this Mac (Tick). Monitor this to completion in the Photos app, at the bottom of the Library.\n\n\n*On the iPhone: Settings | Photos | Download and Keep Originals (Tick) Monitor this to completion in the Photos app at the bottom of Recents.\n\n\n*On the Mac, duplicate the ~/Photos/Photos Library.photoslibrary (or however your iCloud enabled library is named). On an APFS system this will take seconds.\n\n\n*Verify the copied library is not iCloud enabled by opening it and checking Photos | Preferences | iCloud states \"iCloud features for Photos are only available in the System Photo Library\"\n\n\n*Run a Time Machine backup to ensure both versions are safe\n\n\n*Disable iCloud Photos on iPhone: Settings | Photos | iCloud Photos (Off). All photos will remain on the phone. If all photos are not currently on the phone then that is what causes it to prompt.\n\n\n*Then delete the photos through macOS Photos using the iCloud enabled library, or via the website. They will be removed from iCloud, but remain on your phone.\nFuture photos taken on the phone will not end up in iCloud, so if you want to transfer them to your Mac you will have to import to macOS Photos, or use the Image Capture utility, both with the phone connected via USB.\n", "Q: Transfer Device Enrollment from one Mac to another I enrolled my private MBP with my employer's Intune Company Portal and got access to company resources.\nNow they changed the policy and private MacBooks are no longer allowed to be be enrolled.

Whenever I connect my iPhone to my car via cable, it starts the music player and always on the very same content. If I use siri, as soon as it's done, music will also start even if it wasn't playing before.\nI can't stand the first chords of the first music on that playlist anymore. I tried to look for options to prevent this but could not find any.\n\nA: I wish I had a better answer, but I put a song that always is first in my album to ensure I get an hour of silence when this happens.\nSome artists have even uploaded songs that you can add or buy for this.\n\n*\n\n*https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-a-a-a-a-very-good-song-silent-track/1268932999?i=1268933000\nSince your car has to be able to start playing it’s apparently hard for Apple to decide which command to not obey.\nI’m not holding my breath for automakers to fix their side of the implementation as well. You’d think Apple could program this to at least shuffle some random song, but so far, you have to take action and make as much silence as Apple has provided on an actual “fix” for this.\n\nA: It sounds like you may have a Shortcut Automation enabled. You can verify this by going to the Shortcuts app and selecting the Automation at the bottom. In the Personal section, see if there is an automation labeled \"When CarPlay connects\". Tap on it, then the next window should look something like this:\n\nIn the Do section, you will see Play Music; tap on it. The next window will give you the opportunity to select the playlist that you would like to listen to.\nNow in the Music app, you should have a playlist of the particular music you are interested in.\nHow do you get it to stop playing the same content over and over again?\nThis is where you have to get creative with the playlist inside of the Music app. What I will do is create a Smart Playlist of whatever artist, genre, etc. I want for that playlist. In the options for the Smart Playlist, check the \"Limit to ...\" option.\n\nSelect the number of items, hours, minutes, etc. then after \"selected by\" choose least often played. This will check the play count for songs that fit the criteria of the top section of this window. As in the screenshot, it will only select 100 of the least played songs by the \"Artist\" that contains whatever string you provide.\nI'm not really sure about the issue you are having with Siri, but hopefully this gives you another option so as not to have to listen to the same chords repeatedly.\n", "Q: Watch and iPhone can communicate with one another in airplane mode. How is this possible? My iPhone and WiFi-only Apple watch are sync'd in such a manner than when putting the watch in airplane mode, the phone also enters airplane mode. My understanding is that airplane mode disables all radio activity: WiFi, cellular, and Bluetooth.\nWhen entering airplane mode on the watch, presumably the watch tells the iPhone to enter airplane mode as well. So now both devices are in airplane mode.\nBut I'm curious about what happens when airplane mode is turned off. Let's say I turn off airplane mode on the watch. WiFi and Bluetooth are now restored on the watch. Fine. It then reaches out to the iPhone to tell it to turn off its airplane mode. But theoretically the iPhone shouldn't be able to respond, should it? All of it's radios are off after all. Yet somehow it works.\nQ. How is the watch able to give instructions to the iPhone when the iPhone's radios are off?\n\nA: By default Bluetooth is left on and that’s how the devices communicate.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204234\n\nWhen you turn on Airplane Mode, it turns off all radios except for Bluetooth. If you turn off Bluetooth while you're in Airplane Mode, your device will remember the next time you turn on Airplane Mode.\n\nThe primary risk to aviation safety is ground based interference of radar altimeters, but many regulations on cellular network power and transmissions exist still out of an abundance of caution or other concerns like presumably attentive crowds during higher risk takeoffs and landings.\n\nA: When you enable Airplane Mode, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi can still be enabled. This is because Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are typically approved at all times during flights.\nYou can turn off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and it will fully turn it off (unlike when Airplane Mode is off, where turning it off Bluetooth retains Watch connectivity) with a diagonal line through the icon.\nAfter turning on Airplane Mode, review the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi settings to see the current status. Airplane Mode will remember the choices you made, so if you turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi it will turn them off again in the future.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204234\n", "Q: 'Shadow tabs' on Safari? I'm not sure what the name of this feature is or what it does, but it confuses me, and I was wondering if I could disable it. Sometimes I have a Safari window open with multiple tabs. For a long time, I would click the name of the tab at the top, and drag that tab somewhere else, and it would give the tab its own window. But now, sometimes when I do this (I am not sure what triggers when this does or does not happen), I get two copies of the tab, one with a shadow over it. If I try to close the shadow tab on the original window, the second copy of the tab just goes back to being a new tab. What is this feature, and how can I disable it? Here's a screenshot of what I mean; this resulted from me just dragging this tab away to try and give it its own window.\nEdit: Other people are reporting this as a bug, c.f. https://www.reddit.com/r/Safari/comments/xhqjgl/safari_16_dragging_out_tabs/\n\n\nA: While I suspect this is a bug, it isn't a memory leak since that wouldn't cause a behavior like this.\nIf you have two windows open with the same tab group selected, each tab is shown in both window. To avoid conflicts, the tabs are linked, so you'll see this behavior if you open the same tab in the same tab group in two windows.\nI suspect that somehow you're triggering the creation of two linked tabs unintentionally. I was able to reproduce this shortly, but then it stopped happening.\n\nA: Looks like memory leak to me. Wait for Apple's official fix.\n", "Q: On a m1 Mac, difference between homebrew on /usr/local and /opt/homebrew With a m1 Mac, home-brew does not store things in /usr/local, but /opt/homebrew. Is there any difference to switch homebrew over to /usr/local? I think the only reason would be that when you google something you don't have to change /usr/local to /opt/homebrew. Are there any other practical reasons other than consistency?\n\nA: From https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-should-i-install-homebrew-in-the-default-location\n\nHomebrew’s pre-built binary packages (known as bottles) of many formulae can only be used if you install in the default installation prefix, otherwise they have to be built from source. Building from source takes a long time, is prone to failure, and is not supported.\n\nAlso\n\nThe prefix /opt/homebrew was chosen to allow installations in /opt/homebrew for Apple Silicon and /usr/local for Rosetta 2 to coexist and use bottles.\n\n", "Q: NSURLErrorDomain error -1012 when checking for software updates There is a new MacOS Ventura update that was recently released.

I also used the command sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder to reset the DNS cache. This also did not fix the problem, even changing DNS server settings to Google or Quad9.\nDid anyone else get the error NSURLErrorDomain error -1012 when checking for software updates before? How did you fix the problem?

I just switched from windows to Mac. I used MAMP for my web development, and with it I could go to \"localhost\" and it would connect to the server. Now after installing MAMP on a Mac, \"localhost\" I get Macs native It works!, not my index. If I go to \"localhost:8888\" it does go to the index though. Is there a way to just use localhost?\n\nA: It's working as designed. Your MAMP is running on port 8888, so if you navigate to localhost it tries to load the default port 80 (http://localhost:80) (or :443 for https) and finds nothing.\nYou need to adjust your software to run on the port you'd prefer – in this case port 80 (again, or 443 if you're using https).\n", "Q: Does an iPad backup restore the device exactly as it was? I'm using an older version of a critical app on a slightly older version of iOS - both have updates available but I can't risk problems if I update unless there's a way to roll back, which is not something appstore allows.\nIf I take a full backup of my device and then update apps+iOS, will restoring the backup revert all the apps to the exact versions previously installed? Is the backup a full byte for byte image of the device?\n\nA: No, backups take the general device settings and containers for each app and store them only. The operating system and the apps themselves do not backup.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977\nYou can not roll back the iOS or iPadOS upgrade except in very special and sometimes time limited circumstances.

I noticed an interesting case where a website had blocked me from accessing contents on Safari (Private Mode), switching over to Safari Technology Preview (Private Mode) resolved these issues. Either through a user-agent ban or stored cookies (which should be impossible since I'm on Private Mode), somehow regular Safari is not able to work.\nDoes anyone know why a unique situation like this could occur? I'm wondering if it's because of cookies/identifiers stored somewhere inside my MacOS files causing the website to allow me to use it at all. I understand that using Safari Private does not allow cookies to \"exist\" after it shuts down. Even after rebooting my Macbook, clearing all Safari data, and emptying my caches, the website is still blocking me. However, using Safari Technology Preview fixes everything. Does Safari PT interact differently with websites? Is Safari Private actually keeping identifiable information even after closing out of it? Surely some information from Safari Private is stored somewhere, either deep in the files/folders of /Library or in RAM, which is why Safari TP works and Safari Regular does not.\nWeird situation, hoping someone can help me out.\n\nA: It's likely because Safari Technology Preview is a different version of Safari and has improved handling of Private Mode detection, or as you said – a user agent ban.\n", "Q: Fully functional package manager for MacOS Intro\nI am a big fun of Linux. I am going to change my job and will be forced to use MacOS. I know I need to get used to many new things and admit \"MacOS way and philosophy\" in general. Also I know it is better to agree to some things than try to change them.\nProblem\nI do care about security and stability and this is why I prefer to update all my system once a week. On Linux I can do it with one command only apt upgrade which updates the system and all installed apps as well.\nOn MacOS I use homebrew package manager which doesn't allow to update system and GUI apps (actually it does, but it is remove & install, which caused data and privileges lose). This is why on Mondays I have to run every single app and check for updates via internal update mechanism. Furthermore, if an app gets an update, it notifies me about this and it is impossible to turn off such notifications, which will be shown until the app is updated.\nI can't bare such behavior and every Monday it makes me sad. I can't believe there isn't an opportunity to update all apps with a single command. And, for example, chrome may get a new update next day and I have to look at this \"New update available\" icon all the week long ))\nQuestion\nIs there a package manager which allows to keep my system updated with minimum routine from my side?\n\nA: apt upgrade on Linux only updates apps installed through apt.\nTherefore on macOS you need to run a command to update software installed through each source you obtained the software.\nYou could obtain all your software through Homebrew, which includes Google Chrome. Then brew upgrade would upgrade Chrome too.\n\nA: As it was suggested in comments to the original post you can use softwareupdate for mac app store updates, brew upgrade for apps installed via homebrew and as \"a big fan of linux\" you should be familiar (or at least not afraid of scripting), so try using MacOS's built-in Automator application where you should be able to script workflow needed for making macupdater to update apps. And then in a good tradition of unix philosophy you can combine all those 3 together and get working solution.\n\nA: MacUpdater is the best app for checking your GUI apps and installing updates. It will take your weekly update regimen from a chore to a pleasure.\nIt is a 99.9% (my estimate) complete solution for alerting you to updates, including those in the Mac App Store. Wherever possible MacUpdate has a single click to update an app, and in other cases leads you to getting the update. And, so there are no nasty surprises, alerts you to major changes of app version number which may indicate a paid update.\nHere the main window of MacUpdater on my Mac:\n\nRegarding timing, MacUpdater can be set to do regular background checks for updates if you want. But it is easy to run it once a week.\nWhat is missing from MacUpdater is alerting for command line apps installed by Homebrew. So you still need brew update and brew upgrade to check and install those updates.\nNote, I have nothing to do with the developer - I am just a happy (and paying) user.\nEdit (some additional notes):\nThere are three types of apps which can't be updated automatically.  Firstly, those that are not yet able to be updated automatically (and maybe never be). After clicking 'Manual Update' this windows is shown:\n\nSecondly there are a few apps (in my case those by Adobe and Marcel Bresink) which have their own updater app. The best that can be done here is to open the app specific updater. For Photoshop, clicking the 'Open Updater' button loads Adobe's Creative Cloud app.\nAnd finally, Mac App Store apps. For these MacUpdater opens the App Store with the app to be updated.  In my part of the world, MacUpdater detects the presence of updates many days before the 'Updates' button in the App Store app's sidebar.\nAnother Edit regarding automation:\nMacUpdater can be configured to run all the time in the background with regular scans of your apps. Clicking on the menubar icon produces this:\n\nWhilst I like to check each app before updating, there are options to make this easier.  Everyone need to explore these, but here is one of the panes in MacUpdater's settings:\n\n", "Q: Proper workspace organisation Intro\nI am a big fun of Linux. I am going to change my job and will be forced to use MacOS. I know I need to get used to many new things and admit \"MacOS way and philosophy\" in general. Also I know it is better to agree to some things than try to change them.\nProblem\nI spend hours in front of my laptop and, obviously, I have to use it for my private needs. For this purpose I use two activities in KDE: Private, Corporate. The first one contains all my private and the second one contains all my corporate apps. When I share my screen I don't care about sensitive data between those two activities - my colleagues don't see my private conversations and my family doesn't see my job related staff. Very useful.\nUser case\nI am heaving a zoom call with my team while my wife is visiting a Mall. She may ask me about some things and I just jump into Private activity by Win + Tab, give clarifications about her question and jump back.\nI am having some free time and decided to looking for a new washing machine. So, on my Private activity I create Excel document, where listed all options I have found during my search. In case suddenly call, I just jump into Corporate activity and participate in the discussion without any worries about screen sharing or data loosing - everything stay where I left it.\nThe point is that I can keep my private apps active and be able to use them quickly without worries if someone see something that he shouldn't (conversations, emails, accounts details, etc)\nQuestion\nIs there a way to organize my workspace similarly on MacOS?\n\nA: Yes, they're called \"spaces\" in macOS. Here's a user guide from Apple about using them: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/work-in-multiple-spaces-mh14112/mac\nThere are a bunch of demo videos out there.

My iPhone came with a Lightning to USB-C cable which looks similar to the cable that I got with my Apple Magic Keyboard and Apple Magic Mouse.\nAre all of these cables capable of the high-speed charging of my iPhone, or do I need to be careful not to mix these cables up?\n\nA: The 8 pin Lightning connector and assorted Apple cables will not be the limiting factor for charging any Apple device. The power adapter to which it connects will determine the fastest charging rate since the MFI program has certified manufacturers to ensure correct fast charging with embedded chips in the cables to identify them to the iPhone / iPad / keyboard or other accessory that charges via lightning connector.\n\nMost third party cables (especially ones that are listed) will be just as good for charging - especially ones with MFI hardware and certification.

Especially not the \"Local Items\" keychain. From the horse's mouth:\n\"You can’t copy passwords stored in your Local Items or iCloud Keychain.\"\nApple wants you to use iCloud to store your (keychain) logins, which you may disagree with…\nThe procedure to migrate your keychain data (and specifically Local Items) is listed in the Apple article, and with slight variations, around here as well… however this post is not about this.\nI'm cloning systems where I don't have specific important passwords stored. But of course, Keychain needs to work smoothly, or else the OS installation becomes a disaster of endless prompts. After running the Setup Assistant's Migration Assistant, the Local Items keychain becomes impossible to access. It asks for the system's admin password, but the correct one wouldn't work. (Tried it 20 ways to heaven.) Trying to create an item in the keychain brings up this awesome error:\n\nAn error has occurred: no error. I love it! Beats Word 2.0's \"out of memory\" not-out-of-memory error messages.\nBetter yet, it's equally impossible to access the Passwords panel in System Preferences, nor reset Keychain (in Keychain Access > Preferences). They also ask for the admin's password and reject it.\nmacOS 12.6. This is reproducible.\n\nA: The solution was to go to ~Library/Keychains, and delete everything in there. This will achieve the same goal of resetting Keychain.\nI was worried it'd wreak havoc in the system, but it appears that the essential entries are immediately regenerated, for both the Local Items and the logins keychains.\nWith Keychain working again, if you have logins you wish to migrate over, use the procedures outlined in the aforementioned links to do so.\nPS Interestingly, another account I have on the system didn't exhibit the problem at all; its Keychain migrated fine, including Local Items. It seems that only the admin or active account that performs the Migration, is affected.\n", "Q: Apple Developer Program for personal app I'm working on a probably-not-to-be-published app that requires a single plist synced between devices.

If I do, I understand that it will come with iOS 16 and downgrading is impossible.  I am not sure which version of iTunes and MacOS it will need.\nI'm concerned that a new iPhone with a newer iOS will require a newer version of iTunes on my Mac, which will require a newer MacOS, which may require a newer MacBook altogether.\nI'd like to avoid buying a new laptop and losing the ability to use my work software just because I want to upgrade my phone.\nSo the question is, is there a compatibility list/chart to show which iPhone/iOS works with which Mac/MacOS/iTunes?\nEDIT:  Given the comments I'll ask a more specific question:  If I upgrade my iPhone to iOS 15.7 (the option given), which iTunes will be required?  Which MacOS will be required for that version of iTunes?  Will my existing MacBook Pro be enough for that MacOS?  This is a specific case of what I'm asking above.\n\nA: Apple in the past has had excellent backwards support for your iPod, Watch, phone when they cease updating the os. If your device is incapable of running newer than iOS 15 you should have a very long run of current and future apps to sync with it. This is Apple first party expectations only. Third party depends entirely on the budget of that specific third party.\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_version_history#Overview\nCase in point, iOS 12 just got updates in August 2022. As long as you update each device as far as it can go, you can expect the longest coverage. If however you stopped on iOS 13 (for example when you could have gone to iOS 14 and then iOS 15), you will have much shorter windows of support and updates.\nYou’re in that tough spot with iOS 11.

I like seeing week numbers on my iPhone’s Calendar app, but they display in Gregorian form. I use the ISO 8601 format for my work, which is slightly different, but an international standard. Yet I cannot find a setting to change this.\n\nIf I wanted a Japanese or Buddhist calendar, however, that wouldn’t be problem!\n\nCertainly some iPhone users around the globe also need an ISO 8601 calendar for this built-in app. Is there any way for me to get it to work on my device?\nA couple notes:\n\n*\n\n*I’m not interested in learning about other apps that do have this option. My question is about the official Apple iPhone Calendar app.\n\n*The macOS has an option to change from Gregorian to ISO 8601. It seems odd to me that this option wouldn’t extend to Apple’s mobile devices too. Maybe changing it on my Mac will cause it to change on my iPhone? IDK.\n\n\nA: It seems like \"Gregorian\" on iOS uses different week numbering depending on your region.\nI had my phone region set to New Zealand, and was seeing the non-ISO week numbering. Changing the region to Finland seems to switch to ISO week numbers, even though the calendar is still set to Gregorian (and still with only Japanese and Buddhist as the other options).\n \n\n\nSidenote / rant:\nThis feels like a case of Apple being too clever by half; reducing configurability for the sake of simplicity, but leading to a confusing user experience.\nI'm not even sure its assumption about NZ week numbering conventions are correct, but I can't find any authoritative source on that. Wikipedia indicates that \"most of Asia and Oceania\" uses ISO 8601, but that section has also been tagged as dubiously sourced. Maybe it's just the case that these conventions are hard to pin down for regions where they aren't as commonly used? Maybe they should be configurable?\nNote also how in Finland you get to configure a number format, while in NZ you don't.

This answer addresses concerns posted by user Fred - with respect to my first answer.\n\nMy first answer used the \"Copy To…\" action to extract the OS X Install ESD folder to the users Downloads folder. Here, this Downloads folder is assumed to be in a NTFS formatted volume. However in a now deleted post†, Fred - stated the following.\n\nAnd yes, my Downloads folder is NOT on the system drive and NOT NTFS but ExFAT. One reason for changing the Downloads directory is that my system drive is way too small for all the smaller or bigger downloads. I am convinced, quite a lot of people use non‑default system setups, for instance do not install programs on the system drive but on another partition (as I do whenever possible). ExFAT comes in handy for various reasons, of course not for program installations and things that require NTFS permissions, but for downloads and shared drives this is very good.\n\nBTW, I believe the \"system drive\", that Fred - referred to, is actually called the \"Windows partition\" in Microsoft documentation.\nIn this answer, I used the \"Copy To…\" action to extract the OS X Install ESD folder to a dma\\downloads folder I created on an exFAT formatted drive E:. I received the following popup with a single error message.\n\nThis message is repeated below.\nCannot open output file : The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. : E:\\dma\\Downloads\\OS X Installer ESD\\BaseSystem.dmg:com.apple.diskimages.recentcksum\n\nBy examining the string BaseSystem.dmg:com.apple.diskimages.recentcksum, one can determine this string is referring to an alternate data stream. Since exFAT does not support alternate data streams, an error message was generated. After further testing, I can state the following.\n\nThis answer and my original answer do not require any alternate data streams which can or can not be copied from the InstallMacOSX.dmg file downloaded from Apple.\n\nSo, if this is the only error message in the popup, then you can ignore the message and proceed with creating the USB flash drive OS X El Capitan installer.\n\n†Actually, Fred - originally posted an answer which was edited by Fred -, then me and finally a moderator. At the time of this posting, the moderator converted the answer to a comment, then deleted the answer.\n", "Q: Is it possible to recover tabs on Safari 16?

Ventura [13.0 Beta (22A5352e)] ships with OpenSSH_9.0p1.\nAccording to the OpenSSH release notes:\n\nThis release disables RSA signatures using the SHA-1 hash algorithm  by default. This change has been made as the SHA-1 hash algorithm is  cryptographically broken, and it is possible to create chosen-prefix  hash collisions for <USD$50K\n\nThe web host to which I want to connect has OpenSSH_5.3p1 which seems to be configured to only offer RSA and DSA:\nno matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss\n\nI would prefer to use ed25519 keys. I temporarily \"fixed\" the problem by adding the following to my /etc/ssh/ssh_config file:\nHostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa\nPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa\n\nThere must be a better way. Of course, I can't make the web host upgrade their OpenSSH, so the fix will have to be on my end.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: If the server won't take ed25519 keys, you can't use ed25519 keys. You have to use a key type that the server supports, end of story.\nAs long as the OpenSSH client still supports some feature in common with the server, you can keep using it. If it's disabled by default, you can enable it for a specific server by adding a Host section to the file ~/.ssh/config in your home directory. Something like:\nHost my-old-server.example.com\nPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa\n\nIf you're not sure what settings to change, here's how you can find out:\n\n*\n\n*You can list supported settings with ssh -Q sig, etc. Use shell completion or see man ssh_config for what you can put after -Q.\n\n*You can see the default allowed settings by running ssh -G localhost. This dumps the configuration that ssh uses when connecting to localhost.\n\n*You can see what settings your client offers and what settings the client supports by connecting with logging on: ssh -vvv my-old-server.example.com.\n\nNote that for ordinary SSH usage, even signatures based on SHA-1 are fine. SHA-1 is broken when it comes to collisions, and this is catastrophic for public-key infrastructures: an attacker who wants to impersonate goodserver.example.com can calculate a ”garbage“ name such that a certificate request for goodserver.example.com and the garbage name have the same SHA-1 hash, register the garbage name and obtain a valid certificate for it, and because of the SHA-1 hash collision that certificate is also valid for goodserver.example.com. This is how TLS (including HTTPS) is typically used, but not SSH. When you connect directly to a server, the security property that matters for the hash is second preimage resistance (so the attacker can't impersonate the server directly), and SHA-1 is still unbroken in this respect.\nAs for RSA, it's just as secure as ECDSA or Ed25519, its only downside is that it's a bit slower.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create a Services or Quick Actions item in a blank Finder window?

I couldn't find any app for this and neither ways of locking the screen through shortcuts.\n\nA: Yes, the Voice Over trick does work. What most tutorials fail to explain is what Voice Over is supposed to be. You can still use the phone \"normally\" while it's on, but you have to use double taps where single taps are normally required.\nThus, the trick is:\n\n*\n\n*Enter the camera and set it to video.

This should turn the screen off. If it doens't, the device probably failed to identify the 3 fingers 3 times. Don't worry: The video is still recording.\n\n*When you're done filming whatever you want, triple-tap the screen with three fingers again. This should bring the screen back on again. Again, it's not hard to miss it.

They are an important part of the system’s BSD layer but are more useful to software developers than end users.\n\nThese are hidden to the user, and include /bin, /tmp, /dev, /usr, and more.\nMy question is: how can I identify these directories?\nI notice that chflags has a UF_HIDDEN flag, which I thought might help, however while UF_HIDDEN is set on /bin and /dev, it is not set on /tmp (so it must not be set for all UNIX-specific directories).  I was also wondering if mdls could help, as I notice the following:\nkMDItemSupportFileType = (\n    MDSystemFile\n)\n\nHowever, this value (MDSystemFile) is present on /bin/bash as well as many other files that are not UNIX-specific directories (as they are files).  I thought it might be possible that the file is a UNIX-specific directory if the kMDItemSupportFileType contains MDSystemFile, and the file is a directory, however this theory also fell apart as MDSystemFile is not present for /tmp.\nHow can these UNIX-specific directories be identified?\n\nA: To programmatically determine whether a file or directory is hidden in macOS, use the NSFileManager. This can be done via AppleScript, Objective-C, or Swift.\nNSURLIsHiddenKey\nCheck if a file or directory has the NSURLIsHiddenKey attribute associated and that it is set to true:\n\nKey for determining whether the resource is normally not displayed to users, returned as a Boolean NSNumber object (read-write).\n\nNote that file and directory names beginning with a period (.) are hidden, regardless of this attribute.\nUse a function such as NSFileManager's enumeratorAtURL:includingPropertiesForKeys:options:errorHandler: to enumerate the file system and query the desired attributes.\n\nReturns a directory enumerator object that can be used to perform a deep enumeration of the directory at the specified URL.\n\n\nA: There's no technical distinction as such in play here. The term \"UNIX-specific directory\" is not a \"thing\" in terms of the macOS operating system.\nThe name only comes into play for Apple to explain what types of files and folders are hidden from view by the Finder program. So the actual definition of what it is, is simply how Finder works.\nThe best way to find the full list of files and folders hidden by Finder is to reverse engineer the Finder.app program.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro M1 shows cross in battery icon Since yesterday, my mac is showing a cross in battery icon in menu bar.\n\nI'm unable to boot it up after shutting down without plugging in the charger.

Moving books into this folder gets them on to my Books app on the iPad and the Mac.\nThe location is ~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents.\nThe mystery is that I can use the above address using the Finder (⇧⌘G) but the path bar says that the location is iCloud Drive › Books. There is no way that I can find to navigate to this folder other than using ⇧⌘G.\nThe other mystery is that if I try to access the folder from the shell, it says No such file or directory.\nCan anybody explain how this works, and whether this is the only folder with this spooky behaviour?\nI’m using an Intel iMac macOS 12.6 Monterey.\n\nA: An issue here is how the shell interprests the path to the location.\nThe path you supply ~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents has two issues.\n\n*\n\n*it has a space in so you have to either enclose the path in quotes or escape the space.\n\n*It includes ~ If the path is in in quotes the zsh and bash shells will not expand ~ so use $HOME instead\n\nSo run the commands\nls ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents\n\nor\nls \"$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents\"\n\n\nA: I think it's probably safe to say most of the iCloud related folders have some 'spooky' behaviour. I suspect that xattr are used to specify a policy to Finder, and other UI components, on how to present them. eg to simplify that path into iCloud Drive > Books to use your example.\nThe Books folder can be navigated to via System Preferences | Apple ID | iCloud | Manage (iCloud Storage, bottom right) | Apple Books | Show in Finder. Some, but not all iCloud folders have this option.\n\nTo navigate to it on the command line, observe that Mobile Documents needs to have the space escaped (using ⇧⌘G lets the Finder do the space for you), and that the ending Documents is a (sort-of, but not a Unix link) link back to your own Documents folder. So you would actually type:\ncd ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/\n\nHowever, once there, there is not really anywhere else to go. The Documents subfolder just directs you back to your user's Documents.\nNavigating to the folder via the System Preferences is the safest, though illogical way of doing the job I feel.\n"]
