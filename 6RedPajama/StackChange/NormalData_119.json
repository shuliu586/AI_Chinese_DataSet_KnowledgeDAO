["Q: How to create Windows XP LiveUSB using Ubuntu to replace it I am using an Acer Aspire One netbook with no CD-disk drive, and would like to uninstall Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and install Windows XP in its place. The problem here is that I can't seem to find a program that can put the windows boot files on a USB drive from an ISO file. I have Ubuntu fully installed and have tried using unetbootin. When I tried booting from unetbootin I got a screen with a blue box that had the word \"default\" in it highlighted. underneath the box there was a countdown that said \"will boot from default in 10\" after the countdown finished the number would revert to ten and nothing would happen. Can someone tell me another program that would be useful for this please?\n\nA: Create a bootable Windows XP USB drive:\nDownload \"ms-sys\"\nInstall it.\nPartition your USB drive to NTFS.\nNow copy the files from your Windows XP ISO to the USB drive\nCopy the Windows XP mbr to the USB drive\nms-sys -m /dev/sdX\n\nReplace sdX with the number of your usb hard drive (for example: sda5).\nAfter that, backup your data, then format your drive to NTFS from your Live USB.\nYou can now install Windows XP through the USB.\n\nA: Creating a bootable USB installer for Windows on Ubuntu\nEdit: Windows XP doesn't seem to be supported by WinUSB. This method works fine for Windows Vista and up. See here for a different method that works with Windows XP.\nWinUSB automates the process of creating a bootable USB stick from a Windows installation disk or .iso file. You can install it either from the .deb package provided on the homepage or through a PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:colingille/freshlight\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install winusb\n\nThe GUI should be straightforward and easy to use:\n\n\nA: If you're trying to install Windows XP, you shouldn't need to \"uninstall\" Ubuntu.  You can just install Windows XP.  (You'll lose all your Ubuntu files, but I'm sure you know that.)\nInstalling Windows XP is another matter, and doesn't belong in askubuntu.com.\n\nA: Unless you have a modified SETUPLDR.BIN, it won't work from USB.\nNeeded:\n\n\n*\n\n*Modified SETUPLDR.BIN\n\n*special stuff in the bootsector of the partition (use ms-sys).\n\n*Modified copy of txtsetup.sif copied to the root level\n\n*NTDETECT.COM copied to root level\nWinUSB does not do this, UNetBootin does not do this, the diskpart tutorial does not do this, WinToFlash does not do this, and bit-banging the iso onto the device with dd does not do this.\nRufus does this. However, it is a Windows-only utility (that is unsupported by Wine), so follow the tutorial here (the big post):\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/99478/make-a-bootable-usb-to-install-windows-xp-from-linux\nThough I suppose you could share your target drive to VirtualBox, go through the first part of the installer, and then, instead of rebooting, shutdown the VM. Then turn the computer off and actually boot into the hard drive.\nI think that would work because Windows does not become specific to a given hardware configuration until the second phase, I believe.\nYou see, if you did the whole installation from VirtualBox, Windows would be configured for VirtualBox's emulated hardware platform, not your real hardware.\nThe method of loading the whole iso into memory and booting it usually results in a blue screen at some point. If you really want to do that method, see this: http://diddy.boot-land.net/firadisk/files/win_iso_install.htm\n", "Q: What is the correct way to set config options to a juju service unit with a file? I need to set some secondary config options to a service charm deployed with juju. All of the options needed are preset to empty in the original config.yaml file. Now, some of those settings are changed in a separate config file named extra-config.yaml. How does one set these file config options to the service charm with the config-changed hook triggering? Also, can the extra-config.yaml be placed outside the charms directory structure?\nThis command works, but the config-changed hook is not triggered -->\njuju set --config precise/cool-charm/extra-config.yaml cool-charm\nNote: The docs provide a --file option which is not recognized.\n\nA: Well, it is working as of now (6-21-12) with the current beta version of juju. One needs to issue a\njuju set charm-name --config /path/to/extra-config.yaml\nIt is important to change the config file or add a revision field for the\nconfig-changed hook to trigger. The hook will not trigger if the extra config file was previously set and is unchanged.\n\nA: this looks like a bug from what I can tell.

However, I think the underlying problem is different. I have a very similar laptop and the culprit was that the keyboard backlight uses an excessive amount of power. That power is attributed to asus-nb-wmi, but you can solve the problem simply by turning down the keyboard backlight.

I wanted to give a shot at deploying a Wordpress blog with Juju.\nAlthough am very new to Juju and the Amazon EC2, and am having some troubles. I am able to bootstrap an environment like this:\njuju bootstrap --constraints \"instance-type=t1.micro\nAlthough I have not been successful at deploying anything. Here is the output of juju -v status:\n2012-06-14 21:17:13,377 DEBUG Initializing juju status runtime\n2012-06-14 21:17:13,387 INFO Connecting to environment...\n2012-06-14 21:17:14,241 DEBUG Connecting to environment using ec2-50-112-192-46.us-       west-2.compute.amazonaws.com...\n2012-06-14 21:17:14,241 DEBUG Spawning SSH process with remote_user=\"ubuntu\" remote_host=\"ec2-50-112-192-46.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\" remote_port=\"2181\" local_port=\"52585\".\n2012-06-14 21:18:33,207 DEBUG Retrying connection: Cannot connect to environment using ec2-50-112-192-46.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com (perhaps still initializing): could not connect before timeout after 1 retries\n2012-06-14 21:18:34,039 DEBUG Connecting to environment using ec2-50-112-192-46.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com...\n2012-06-14 21:18:34,039 DEBUG Spawning SSH process with remote_user=\"ubuntu\" remote_host=\"ec2-50-112-192-46.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\" remote_port=\"2181\" local_port=\"41481\".\n\nIt keeps retrying although it never establishes a connection. I thought maybe it just needed some time so I tried it almost an hour later, same thing.  I looked online at the AWS Management Console under Instances and I can see that the instance is running, although it doesn't seem to have any associated keypairs (when I click \"connect\" AWS tells me this).\nI am able to start instances and SSH to them using the ec2-tools by following ec2 starters guide, and running ec2-run-instances ami-20800c10 -k ${EC2_KEYPAIR} -t t1.micro.  The instances I start this way have my key-pair listed under the description tab on the AWS Instances page, and I have the option of connecting to them.\nSo why are the instances I am starting with Juju not getting my key-pair associated with them? I set up ~/.juju/environments.yaml as described here. \nHopefully I am not overlooking something too simple,  thanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: Its hard to help debug this without additional information, specifically which distro your running and the console log for the instance.\nFrom the output it looks like the instance is running, but its not ready yet.\nKeep in mind t1.micros are severely penalized for performing any interesting system activity (like install java packages which bootstrap does), such that it could take a very long time (~hr) to complete the bootstrap process. We stopped using t1.micros as the defaults for juju due to performance issues. \njuju being portable across cloud providers, does not use ec2 key pairs, it relies on cloud-init to install the user key.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit\n", "Q: Adding an existing user to another group I am having this strange problem. I am using usermod to add an existing user to another group. I want to create a new user and add an old user to this new user's group. To do this, I am doing the following things\nCreate a new user, -m creates the home directory for the user and -U creates a group by the same name, as that of the user.\nuseradd -U -m newuser\n\nThen I add the old user to the new user's group as\nusermod -a -G newuser olduser\n\n-a appends this group to the already existing groups and -G is used to give the group name. \nNow when I do groups olduser I get the following out put olduser newuser, but being the olduser I am unable to create a any file in the newuser home directory. I have set the proper directory permissions, the read, write and execute bit is set for group.\nHowever if, instead of using usermod I manually edit the /etc/group file, and add newuser,olduser in front of the newuser group then everything works correctly. Is there a bug in usermod or I am doing something wrong.\n\nA: Have you tried doing this with adduser instead? The Ubuntu Help page recommends not using useradd.  I think what your trying to do could be done like this:\nadduser newuser \n(automatically makes home folder)\nadduser newuser olduser (this adds newuser to the olduser group)\nHope that helps.\nEDIT:\nThis should at least help you figure out if the problem is related to usermod or not.

I hope is not too late to help someone to find its way.\nSo, after trying any possible combination with rfkill in terminal, with and w/o sudo, trying to delete some config files I've found in other \"possible answers\", and searching into BIOS setup the option I didn't find about turning on Wireless always on startup, I kept digging and the answer I found was this:\nDue to an error in linux kernel, rfkill sometimes doesn't act as expected, and there is some incompatibility within linux hardware controller and some hardware devices. Solution recommended by this guy is to start laptop with a bootable pendrive and start wireless from there.\nSo that's what I did, fortunately I had the pendrive wich I used to install current Ubuntu 12.04 LTS OS I'm in now, and after booting with it, I was able to start wireless directly from the menu bar icon. Then it's just a matter of turning off, remove pendrive, and turn on again from HDD. And it's working again, no hard-block anymore.\n\nPd: I'm just guessing, but I think  what triggered the issue in first place is that I turned off the laptop with Wireless deactivated, and then after turning it on again, there was no way to unblock wifi hardware from being off, or not at least with my touch hardware switch.\n\nA: echo \"options asus_nb_wmi wapf=4\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/asus.conf\n\nThis solution solved the problem in an Asus X552C with a Broadcom 43225 wifi card\n\nA: Broadcom hardware often requires closed-source drivers.

I thought about using Clonezilla but I think I would have issues with GRUB (Especially trying to boot from a different UUID than what is in the conf file). do you know of any way this could be done?\nPS, my home directory is encrypted but that's not really an issue, because I can work around that.\nEDIT: changed the explanation to make it clearer\n\nA: Well, I just used usb stick + ubuntu live.\nI was transferring ubuntu 13.10 from larger hdd to a smaller ssd, and clonezilla \"said\" that it can't be done this way since target partition is smaller than the source partition.\nSo I started ubuntu live, mounted both hdd's (new disk, was partitioned earlier of course, don't forget about swap ;) ), and just:\ncd /media/ubuntu/old-hdd-uuid/\n\nthen:\nsudo cp -R --preserve=all bin/ boot/ cdrom/ dev/ etc/ home/ lib/ lib32/ lib64/ media/ mnt/ opt/ proc/ root/ run/ sbin/ srv/ sys/ tmp/ usr/ var/ /media/ubuntu/new-hdd-uuid/\n\nabove you can see that it's just copying all directories from one hdd to another, recursively with all permissions and stuff preserved.\ncd /media/ubuntu/new-hdd-uuid/\n\nthen I had to make two symlinks in root directory of a new disk:\nsudo ln -s boot/vmlinuz-x.xx.x-xx-generic vmlinuz\nsudo ln -s boot/initrd.img-x.xx.x-xx-generic initrd.img\n\nand the next step was installing grub, so:\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=boot/ /dev/sdxy\n\nwhere x - device, y - partition number (if unsure use cfdisk or fdisk to print partition table...)\nand the last step was, changing uuid of a new hdd to uuid from old hdd (it's the easiest way to fool grub config, fstab or else without searching and fixing configurations)\nsudo tune2fs /dev/sdxy -U OLD-UUID\n\nnew UUID will show after device remounting.\nSo now reboot and if everything is ok, your ubuntu should start...\n\nA: You can do it by using dd.  For complete info check the site.\nClone a Hard Drive Using an Ubuntu Live CD \n\nWarning dd is a very powerful low-level tool and even one little typo is sufficient to wipe out an entire disk. Please be very careful with its use and try to use a higher-level tool if at all possible.\nNote also that this method only works if your target disk is the same size or larger\n\n\n\nCloning hard drives is a common maintenance task. Don’t bother burning\n  a new boot CD or paying for new software – you can do it easily with\n  your Ubuntu Live CD.\nNot only can you do this with your Ubuntu Live CD, you can do it right\n  out of the box – no additional software needed! The program we’ll use\n  is called dd, and it’s included with pretty much all Linux\n  distributions. dd is a utility used to do low-level copying – rather\n  than working with files, it works directly on the raw data on a\n  storage device.\n\nYou can also use:\n\nClonezilla, a free hard drive cloning software. Clonezilla runs from a\n  live CD, and features a simple user interface.   You’ll still need to\n  be aware of what you’re doing, of course, but this tool can simplify\n  your job immensely with its step-by-step breakdown.\n\nYou can download Clonezilla here\nWarning Make sure that you check out the Limitation of Clonzilla before you start.\nYou also mentioned that you have used Ghost for windows, well you can use Ghost for Linux as well.\nSource: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/19141/clone-a-hard-drive-using-an-ubuntu-live-cd/\nSource: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/2-methods-to-clone-your-linux-hard-drive/\n\nA: Some years ago I used successfully this tool to \"clone\" my partitions: G4L. Everything worked with some post-installation corrections, such as resizing partitions (I cloned the partitions on different size HD) and grub reinstall (it's pretty simple, you only need a live CD to reinstall it in the MBR).\nYou can safely ignore your swap partition (you will be able to recreat it at a second time) or clone it too and active it later, manually editing /etc/fstab or from command line.\nIn the past weeks I did again the clone with clonezilla, and everything went ok with the same post-cloning corrections. So don't worry and give them a try, nothing on your original HD will be touched!\nEDIT:\nI found an old mail where I described the first cloning process. I acted as follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partitioned my new HD connected via USB exactly as the old one\n\n*Cloned the partitions in raw mode with G4L \n\n*Booted with a Live CD and did the resize of partitions with resize2fs \n\n*Disconnected the HD from USB and mounted on SATA/PATA.\n\n*Booted again with the Live CD and mounted the new disk: \nmkdir disk\nmount /dev/sda1 disk        (where sda1 contains boot and root partitions)\nmount /dev/sda2 disk/boot   (if you have a different boot partition) \nmount --bind /dev/ disk/dev/\nmount -t proc none disk/proc\nchroot disk /bin/bash\ngrub-install /dev/sda       (to install GRUB on sda MBR)\n\n\n*Restart, check the swap\n\n*Enjoy\n\n\nA: @boywithaxe - Regarding your comments to Mitch's answer you can indeed just copy the relevant partitions by doing dd if=/dev/sdb3 of=/dev/sda3. That is actually the easiest part. The most tricky part is that you will also have to mount the newly copied partition, as well as a couple of other partitions and install grub (grub-install /dev/sda) (and add a swap partition before you reboot (if you are cloning a bootable partition)). Using this method there is no need to resize2fs either.\nI have just had to do this myself, and I used a combination of Boot repair after a Windows Upgrade on Ubuntu 14.04 (non-RAID) and jasmines answer.\nSo, after having booted from the liveCD:\ndd if=/dev/sdb3 of=/dev/sda3\n\nWhen that has finished, then\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt \n\nwhere sda3 contains the recently copied boot and root partitions)\nsudo mount --bind /dev/ /mnt/dev/\n\nsudo mount -t /proc none /mnt/proc\n\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda \n\nnote this is sda not sda3\nupdate-grub\n\nexit\n\n\nA: I actually ended up using Gparted from the Live CD. I copied the partition and pasted it in the unallocated space on the other HDD. Then I used blkid to check the UUIDs and edited the fstab file. Worked like a charm!\n", "Q: Is Quickly a Python-only development tool? I'm looking at the Ubuntu app development tool Quickly. From what I can see only Python is available with this tool.

The printer works, but the scanner doesn't now. In 11.10 I had to install a special driver from Brother. The printer's model is Brother MFC-290C. The computer is a Toshiba Satellite. How can I get the scanner working?\nUpdate:\nI have a 64-bit installation on the Toshiba Satellite. Thank you for your instructions, Chad--24216.  I followed each step: 1 through 5.

Since upgrade 12.04 LTS I noted this process because it's giving errors on startup and shutdown:\nunable to stat gdomap\n\nWhat is gdomap? What is it used for? Can be safely removed? How?\n\nA: What Is gdomap?\ngdomap is a daemon used by GNUstep programs. GNUstep is a framework for building applications that adheres to the OpenStep API specifications.\nIs it safe to disable/remove gdomap?\nRichard Frith-Macdonald stated the following in 2010:\n\nThe gdomap deamon is completely unused for most applications!   I don't think \n  any GNUstep applications use it in normal operation (ie if you haven't given \n  them command-line options to tell them to communicate between different \n  hosts/users).  The vast majority of DO connections are private to a single user \n  on a single machine and use message ports (implemented as unix domain sockets \n  or as message queues on mswindows) and they don't need/use a namesperver as \n  name information is written to the local filesystem (or windows registry).\n\nI don't know if every application using the gdomap daemon has to register a name, but I listed the registered applications and found nothing:\n$ gdomap -N\nNo names currently registered with gdomap\n\nI also listed to see what other applications listed gnustep as a dependency and only found gnustep-games:\n$ sudo apt-cache rdepends gnustep\ngnustep\nReverse Depends:\n  gnustep-games\n\nHow do I disable/remove gdomap?\nSo, you can temporarily turn gdomap off until the next restart:\n$ sudo service gdomap stop\n\nOr, you can stop the service and prevent it from starting on boot:\n$ sudo service gdomap stop\n$ sudo update-rc.d -f gdomap remove\n# re-enable with: sudo update-rc.d gdomap defaults\n\nOr, you can completely remove GNUStep:\n$ sudo apt-get remove --purge gnustep\n# NOTE: I had to run this too:\n$ sudo apt-get autoremove\n\nI removed GNUStep on my server; if I encounter any issues I'll be sure to post back.\n\nA: gdomap:\n\nThe gdomap daemon is used by GNUstep programs to look up distributed\n  objects of processes running across the network (and between different\n  user accounts on a single machine). The deamon is NOT used for lookup\n  where two processes belonging to the same user are using a host-local\n  connection.\n\nYou can turn gdomap off.\nYou can disable unwanted/unused services in Ubuntu in a very easy way.

I believe the largest SD cards can be is 2GB, so obviously newer cards are more likely to be SDHC (SD High Capacity) cards. \nYears back I had a Canon camera that could only take SD cards, and it became quite difficult to find new ones because just about all newer SD compatible cards are SDHC. Unfortunately I believe there's no firmware update that can make an old SD card reader recognize SDHC.\nReferences: \nEbay article from 2008 describing the \"new\" SDHC card format\nPC Magazine article stating older hardware cannot use newer card formats\n\nA: There are three types of SD card:\n\n\n*\n\n*SD\n\n*SDHC\n\n*SDXC\n\n\nThe plain SD card can only store (at a maximum) 2GB. The SDHC can store max 32GB, while the SDXC and store up to 2TB of information.\nThe SD card reader is also important here. With a SD reader, you can only read SD cards. With a SDHC reader, you can read SD and SDHC. And so on...\nIt sounds like your laptop has a SD reader, so it can only read SD cards. It cannot read SDHC, SDXC, or any newer SD card.\nIn Windows' case, a driver may have been released to allow use of SDHC cards. As this driver is/was not yet ported to Ubuntu, you are out of luck. It may have been ported, though. Check for updates to the kernel. Also, just try to wait.\n(src)\n", "Q: How to install Intrusion Detection system in Ubuntu 12.04 Basically i m looking for some  Intrusion Detection system....\nso i find snort is one of them , soi i  need step by step configuration to install snort & some snort web-based monitoring tool \n..like \" snort report \"\nis there any good alternative for   Intrusion Detection system ? if yes how to install them\n\nA: \nSnort is Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Snort can sniff\n  your network and alert you based on his rule DB if there is an attack\n  on your computers network. It is an opensource system that was build\n  from tcpdump (linux sniffer tool).\n\nThis guide can be used for installing snort.\n\npsad: Intrusion Detection and Log Analysis with iptables psad is a\n  collection of three lightweight system daemons (two main daemons and\n  one helper daemon) that run on Linux machines and analyze iptables log\n  messages to detect port scans and other suspicious traffic. A typical\n  deployment is to run psad on the iptables firewall where it has the\n  fastest access to log data.  \n\nIf you using 12.04LTS Server, the see How to install PSAD Intrusion Detection on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server.\nSources:\nhttp://nachum234.no-ip.org/security/snort/1-snort-installation-on-ubuntu-11-10-i386/\nhttp://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/index.html\n\nA: You could take a look at fail2ban, which is directly contained in the repos (so you can simply \"sudo apt-get install fail2ban\"). I use it for years now, and it kept a lot of hackers out of my server by blocking them. Fail2ban works by parsing log files for specified patterns (it ships with a good sample config), and then blocking the attackers IP -- e.g. if a hacker made 5 failed attempts to login via ssh (even to different accounts), you can have his IP blocked for a specified length of time (e.g. 30min). There are examples shipped for different services, just take a look at the homepage for additional information.\nEdit: Notifications are also possible (send a mail if something was detected).\n\nA: To answer your question, a step-by-step configuration.\nAlso see this one, but the above worked better for me. Don't expect anything to work the first time though.\n", "Q: How can I force the rediscovery of PulseAudio virtual sound devices? I'm using the PulseAudio feature of network sound devices (not Multicast/RTP) to play sound from my netbook on the audio equipment connected to the HTPC when at home. This creates a virtual sound device that I can then use instead of the physical built-in one. Most of the time this works just fine. Sometimes however, the virtual sound device just doesn't appear. Disconnecting from and reconnecting to the network helps sometimes but not always and it's annoying and potentially bad for existing TCP connections.\nSo my question basically is: Is there some way to tell PulseAudio \"Hey, just look again if you really can't find a network sound device.\"?\n\nEdit: Unloading and reloading the module-zeroconf-discover with pacmd does not help either and it doesn't appear to be an avahi problem per se since avahi-browse -t --all | grep PulseAudio shows lots of right-looking stuff, even when the devices aren't listed in pavucontrol or pacmd list-sinks.\n\nEdit 2: I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 on both boxes for all the difference it might make.\n\nA: *\n\n*On the \"Sink\" PC (On whose speaker you wanna play the sound) open the PulseAudio command shell by going into Terminal and issuing the following command.\n\n$ pacmd\n\nYou will see a Python-like shell with the following welcome message.\nWelcome to PulseAudio! Use \"help\" for usage information.\n>>>\n\n*List the devices that can play the sound on the PC by the command in the PulseAudio shell. \n>>> list-sinks\n Now you'll see a detailed list of all the sound sinks.\n\n*Just note down the complete name of the sink of your choice. It would appear as an attribute of the sound card. For example in my case it is:\n1 sink(s) available.\nindex: 0 \nname: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo> \n...\n\n\nThe string of my interest is just \"alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\"\n\n\n*Now Go onto the Source PC (i.e. origin of the audio multimedia streams), open up the terminal and issue the following command\n$ pactl load-module module-tunnel-sink \"server=192.168.1.105 sink=alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo sink_name=home_theater\"Here 192.168.1.105 is the IP address of the sink PC, \"alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\" is the string you just copied from sink's terminal and \"home_theater\" is just a fancy name to call this virtual sound output device on your computer.\n\n*Finally select this virtual sound device by : \n$ pacmd set-default-sink home_theater\n\nWallah !!\n\nA: A simple sudo service avahi-daemon restart does the trick, even though avahi-browse sees the devices before that avahi restart. Thanks to Takkat for pointing me in the right direction.\n\nA: This answer is untested so it might not work, but it may lead you to the right direction. \nI can confirm unresolved issues with an Avahi service that sometimes is unable to connect to a PulseAudio server. We may succeed reconnecting by either restarting the network, or the pulseaudio server but alas this does not always work.\nTo overcome this issue we may try to establish a network audio stream using the native TCP protocol to stream directly to the IP rather than using an Avahi name resolution.\nTo do so we can tunnel a remote sink by loading the module-tunnel-sink on the receiver side. On the sender we have to enable the native TCP protocol by loading module-native-protocol-tcp.\nSee also this question for terminology and how to define the PULSE_SERVER variable:\nHow to automatically set PulseAudio default sink to remote server at boot - Ubuntu 9.04\nIt is a rather old question for Ubuntu 9.04 but to my knwoledge terminology and procedures have not changed much since then.\nPlease also follow the PulseAudio Wiki on network connections.\n\nA: You could try pulseaudio -k, which kills the pulseaudio service (it seems to start up again automatically). This has brought things back for me before.\nThe other thing which sometimes helps is unticking and then reticking the boxes in Pulseaudio Preferences (a.k.a. paprefs). Checkboxes are Make discoverable PulseAudio network sound devices available locally in Network Access, and Enable network access to local sound devices in Network Server. Obviously this probably only works for the one you're using.\n", "Q: How to get XChat to automatically \"ghost\" the old \"session\" on provider-forced reconnect?

I only need to retrieve my database backup and everything else can go.\n\nA: In general I'd suggest burning and booting a live CD such as Ubuntu or SystemRescueCD and using extundelete to recover any deleted files.\n\nA: Foremost may be able to find the files you care about. I used it to help a friend extract files from a drive that had physically failed with some unrecoverable sectors. \n\nA: It is time to restore from backup.  Failing that, it sounds like your files are in /lost+found so you will need to look through there and try to identify them ( their original names have been lost ).\n\nA: I recently had a coworker recover data using 'scalpel'.

I am just getting started with using quickly and I have a small project that's starting to take shape.\nRight now I would like to add a translation to my project.\nI already noticed that quickly automatically generates po/.pot but I can't quite figure out how/where to add the language-specific .po files.\nI tried creating en.po / de.po / es.po manually inside the po/ sub-directory but - even after I run quickly share - quickly (using quickly run or the installed .deb) doesn't  seem to recognize / use the translations.\nAm I missing something really obvious/stupid?\nAny help would be highly appreciated!\nCheers,\nMarcel\n\nA: Translation files (.po files) should live under the same directory as the translation template (.pot file). That's generally the po/ folder:\npo/\nmyapp.pot\nde.po\nca.po\n..\n\nIt's generally the job of the translators to create a .po file for their language out of the template and then send it to the developer, who will commit it to the source tree. Or the cleverer and more modern way: use Launchpad to translate your app and to automatically commit the .po files to your source tree. This way translators will be able to translate online and never have to worry about sending e-mails or knowing about the underlying format.\nBut anyway, back to the question: if you've got a valid .po file at least, the quickly share or quickly package commands should pick it up and do all the work for you.\nThat is, they compile the textual .po file into a binary .mo file and put it in the package ready to install.\nThat should work for your app. However, you can do a test without using the quickly commands. Try running the following command at the top of your source tree, where you usually run the Quickly commands:\npython setup.py build_i18n\nThat should do a local build of the translation files into the build/ directory, where you should find the .mo files.\n\nA: Also, remember to wrap strings in your app with _() to ensure they are translated. For example.\nmywidget.set_text(_(\"Help\"))\n\nWhen you next run python setup.py build_i18n your POT file will then be generated.\n", "Q: After a compiz traditional crash my top toolbar disappeared.

If you use a non-default display manager, replace lightdm with kdm or gdm as appropriate.\n\n*In most cases, restarting unity should work. unity --replace\nThis will restart just Unity. Any open applications will remain open, and is hence safe and better to try this before restarting DM. If the command exits with 137; retry it. It works.

Upgrading to 12.04 will mean there will be security updates until April 2017, at least.\nCaveats with upgrading, either Ubuntu release, or just individual pieces of software, are the same. As software is developed and improved, it may have changes to configuration files, or file system layout, which may conflict with what you are currently using; requiring you to deal with differences. Also, libraries may also at some point break ABI and/or API, causing any applications you've developed on top of them, to no longer work correctly. But again, these are all things you'll have to deal with, regardless of how you upgrade the software.\n", "Q: Getting list of installed apps (NOT packages) How can I get list of installed apps (based at files in /usr/share/applications/) without writing own parser? I need just app name, path to app icon and path to launch app.\nI'm using C++ with Qt libraries. Of course, you can write me shell command or something else like it.\n\nA: Here you are. The result of the following command is a list of comma separated values. First column: path to the .desktop entry, second column: path to the icon, third column: the executable.\nfind /usr/share/applications/ -name '*.desktop' -exec perl -ne 'BEGIN { $pname = $ARGV[0] ; } ; /(Icon|Exec)=(.*)/ and $ret{$1} = $2 ; END { printf \"%s,%s,%s\\n\", $pname, $ret{Icon}, $ret{Exec} ; }' {} \\;\n\nExplanation: find prepares a list of files that end with .desktop and are found in /usr/share/applications or a subdirectory thereof, and calls (-exec ... {} \\;) a perl oneliner to parse the information.\nPerl is started with the -n option which creates an implicit loop iterating over each line of the given file, and an -e option which specifies to run the argument provided.\nThe perl program contains BEGIN and END blocks to be run before and after each of the .desktop files is parsed (the perl oneliner is called separately each time for each of the files that find has located). BEGIN block records the filename (which is given as the first argument to the oneliner, the {} pragma of find), and the END blocks summarizes the information in a comma separated manner.\n", "Q: Why don't the Ubuntu repositories have the latest versions of software? Why are packages in the official Ubuntu repositories older than the latest (upstream) versions from Debian Sid, PPAs, the authors, etc.?\n\nA: The accepted answer in the link fossfreedom posted as a comment is very good.\nIn general, package versions released after the first part of the new release development process don't appear in the main repositories of that release so that a reliable Ubuntu version can be tested thoroughly. \nYou may find some packages are released to the backports repository if they are sucessfully incorporated in a future Ubuntu release and if developers believe it will also work with earlier ones. Backports can be activated and deactivated in the Software Center (Edit->Software Sources->Updates Tab->Unsupported Updates)\n\nA: Two reasons.  The first is quite obvious: it requires a human to spend time updating the package when a new upstream comes out.  The second is that if you are running a stable release as opposed to the current development version, packages are intentionally NOT updated willy-nilly to avoid breakage.  See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates.\n\nA: Packages are frozen for the release and not updated subsequently for a number of reasons.  If new releases were brought in post-release, then the new version...\n\n\n*\n\n*might bring new bugs, thereby regressing functionality that was present at the time of the release\n\n*needs manpower to package, test, and upload\n\n*needs its own set of security updates\n\n*would need updated translations for its UI\n\n*would need updated documentation (and translations)\n\n*makes technical support more challenging\n\n*might annoy users who have gotten used to the features in the old version\n\n*may require newer dependencies which could break other apps if they were changed in the repository\n\n*may break other packages that depend on this one\n\n*may break user scripts, templates, tools, etc. created for the old version\n\n\nAll that said, be aware that there are cases where Ubuntu does do full updates of software versions in the repository.  Firefox for instance.\nAlso, there is a ubuntu-backports repository users can opt into which updates software packages that won't cause problems like those listed above.  It's not enabled by default so users have to opt-in to it, which is done to eliminate the surprise of having your software change out from under you.  Also, it's not heavily staffed and so I'm not sure how frequently packages actually get updates.\nFurther, the SRU team has recently updated polices a bit which hopefully will make it a bit more straightforward to get bugfix-only package updates in.\n\nA: An Ubuntu release goes through several stages before it actually makes it to the public as a finished product:\n\n*\n\n*Some time before Ubuntu launches a release it freezes its packages at a certain point.\n\n\n*Before a release is out but after the package freezing, work is done mostly to fix all the bugs and issues that there might be in those packages. New package versions are not imported into the repositories anymore after package or feature freezing.\n\n\n*Once the release happens additional changes to those packages only happen for bug fixing and security issues. There are no more upgrades done to the packages in the official repository even if new versions of the packages are released.\n\n\n*Some packages have an exception to this, such as web browsers (which need to be kept up to date all the time) or certain cases.\nNew version of packages are consistently being imported (from Debian) for the next release of Ubuntu, until the next freeze happens and the same process repeats itself.\nAs an example, you can have a look at the release schedule of 12.04.\nYou can see that even though 12.04 was released in April, in January 12 something called _Debian Import Freeze_ happened.\nThis is just the first of many freeze stages happening before the actual release and means that at that point the import of packages from Debian testing or unstable stops and work starts on them to customize and fix issues with them.\nNo upgrades are done after that point in a lot of packages and the version that package had at that point is the version present and maintained through a release's lifetime.\nSo even though there are higher versions of the same package in developers' PPAs or in Ubuntu+1 repositories those will only be included in the next release of Ubuntu.\nThis is done for stability, security and functionality. New bleeding packages being imported all the time to the main repository would mean issues and a lot more problems to be solved. A freeze in the packages version helps to sort that out and make Ubuntu safer and more stable for the end user.\nA new version of Ubuntu is released every 6 months, so every 6 months new packages are prepared, tested, customized and released with a new version. Future versions of a packages can be installed in your system via a PPA or just by downloading it from a web site, but the version of the package in the official repository remains the same.\nFor more understanding and an interesting overview of what happened to Ubuntu from 10.04 until the launch of 12.04 have a look at ReleaseSchedule - LTS to LTS and Stable Release Updates page for a complete overview and explanation of an Ubuntu stable release.\n\nA: Normally the updates in released versions of Ubuntu are for security and bug fixes, examples of such bugs include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bugs which may, under realistic circumstances, directly cause a security vulnerability. These are done by the security team and are documented at SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures.\n\n*Bugs which represent severe regressions from the previous release of Ubuntu. This includes packages which are totally unusable, like being uninstallable or crashing on startup.\n\n*Bugs which may, under realistic circumstances, directly cause a loss of user data\nBugs which do not fit under above categories, but (1) have an obviously safe patch and (2) affect an application rather than critical infrastructure packages (like X.org or the kernel).\n\n*For Long Term Support releases we regularly want to enable new hardware. Such changes are appropriate provided that we can ensure to not affect upgrades on existing hardware. For example, modaliases of newly introduced drivers must not overlap with previously shipped drivers.\n-New versions of commercial software in the Canonical partner archive.\n-FTBFS(Fails To Build From Source) can also be considered. Please note that in main the release process ensures that there are no binaries which are not built from a current source. Usually those bugs should only be SRUed in conjunction with another bug fix. \n-For new upstream versions of packages which provide new features, but don't fix critical bugs, a backport should be requested instead.\nTaken from the excellent wiki page StableReleaseUpdates.\n\nA: I shall try to answer your questions based on my past experiences from ubuntu forums and ubuntu planet.\nI'm guess I'm just wondering how the apt repositories get updated, and by whom. \nThe APT repos do get updated from the packaging team at Ubuntu. The packaging team gets all the upstream packages from developers who do an initial packaging testing and other things. Then the testing team does the final testing giving a go signal. But the packaging team and the testing teams are very cautious about the dependencies and its side affects to the stable system. \nWhen there's a lag, is it because the developer hasn't pushed the most recent release onto the relevant server? \nIf you see the upstream changes, there are thousands of developers wanting to push their packages. But not all are succeeded into the main stream this is because for various reasons. Assume Gedit application, a 2.2 version is suited and works fine with Dbus 2.1 and Gtk 2.4, etc. Where as Gedit 2.4 version (very new) needs Gtk 2.5 and Dbus2.3 to work. Now testing and packaging team (release team also)does not accept this because changing an existing system having old dbus and gtk with the new one breaks every thing else. Hope you got the point of dependency hell.\nIs there a lot more work for the developer in getting the release into a form the repository can use?\nNot to upstream channel. But to the release channel yes :). \nP.S: There could be a bit changes done to the process now in the canonical compared to whats explained above. But it more or less same. \n", "Q: some questions related to ubuntu app showdown I have some questions about ubuntu appshowdown\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can i submit more than one app in the contest and tell me more about this suppose i submit 5 apps out of which one is won then will it be valid if 2 or 3 are won \n\n*I think the number of t-shirts does not depends upon number of apps one per person\n\n*For development i have to use quickly but can i use third party libraries for GUI or other work i think i will need it for eg. pyside\n\n*The first and second winner will get laptop + mobile too right or not the mobile\n\n*How the prizes will be delivered will they charge(i don't think so)\n\n*I would like to use multiple libraries i can use htme right ?\nmore details are always welcomes I have read mostly all ubuntu app showdown related pages but if you find something in background than tell me\n\n\nNote:\ni am not saying that i am going to win just questions don't take it in that way \n\nA: Hi I think most questions can be answered here. \nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/showdown/rules/ and http://developer.ubuntu.com/showdown/\nI think should be submitted as different questions but I'll try to answer.\n\nFor development i have to use quickly but can i use third party libraries for GUI or other work i think i will need it for eg. pyside\n\nMy understanding is that it has to be availble through ubuntu repo.

I want to have something like windows 2008 RDS-login where every user connects and logins to his own desktop and has his own working environment.\nIs it possible with ubuntu server ?\nThank you\nEdit: It seems that xrdp is able to serve such service. I will check it out.\nEdit2: XRDP does really create the environment I want and works fast and good. I only had a small problem with default xsessions for each login. The solution was to create a .xsession file in ~ of user and add \n    gnome-session --session=gnome\nNow I am trying to change session language for xrdp. Altough user accounts changed their language settings, xrdp session always comes up with default english.\nEdit3:I changed /etc/default/locale to my desired language changing whole operating system to my native language still looking for a way to configure it for per user\n\nA: Just for informational purposes I will answer my own question and tell about what happened.\nAfter the mentioned changes in question XRDP worked but there are problems with XRDP that can not be easily solved. For example there is no way to work with Xrdp on a non-english keyboard. From my searches I couldn't find a solution nor a work around for this problem which is fatal as every keyboard in our company was Turkish.[I later found solution as creating XRDP keyboard map files. But we failed to this as setxkbmap also did not work for various reasons. Check here]\nSo we dropped Xrdp for the favor of NX. NX is a library written by NoMachine it is GPL also has some enterprise verisons. There is also FreeNX implementation but support seemed to be vanished. \nAnyway installation of NoMachine NX is easy and straight forward although you have to do the same trick with .xsession file in home directory of the user to set default desktop if you did not installed unity but only gnome. \nAs NoMachine NX has also enterprise edition I will not talk about the results we get from it in sake of avoiding advertisement.\nAs a last thing it just takes a little bit longer and more tiresome to achive the same results with XRDP altough at the end when they both work NX is faster and gives you more easier configuration they can both achieve same terminal-desktop per user result quite satisfactorily. \n", "Q: Network is only available in recovery mode I am using Ubuntu 12.04, unity. If I boot regularly, there is no internet access. There is no network icon in the unity panel nor does the \"network connections\" program show anything. However, if I boot into recovery mode and select \"enable networking,\" everything works as usual.\nAs far as I know, I have not messed with my network configurations for several months prior to this problem.\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem. I have a Dell Precision T7500 pretty much out-of-the box, with a Quadro FX 580 and a pair of 1T drives. At one point I was dual booting Win 7 and Ubuntu 11.10 with no problems. Then I upgraded to 12.04, and problems made the system unusable. I had modules crashing with the appropriate dialog boxes, when I rebooted, I would get stuck at a command line login -- which didn't work. Eventually I gave up, wiped out the partition and reinstalled 12.04. After the normal problems trying to get my video card to work I realized that the system acted the same way it had before. I.e., very slow, processes crashing; unusable. I finally got what appeared to be a usable system by wiping out the partition, doing a fresh install, and going in to recovery mode on the first boot. From there I ran fsck, started the network, and installed nvidia-current and did an update/upgrade -- which was extensive. But the system seemed normal when it came up. I installed and configured autofs and all was well. Until I rebooted, then I was back to the same problem. I found that all I had to do was boot to recovery mode, start networking, then resume boot and all was well. I tried booting without going through recovery mode and waiting several minutes (like 15-20 or more) to get a usable login prompt, but could only log in as a local user. I did a sudo -i and ran initctl list and found that many of the processes were still waiting. I also had no IPv4 address, though I did have a pair of legal global IPv6 addresses. I ran dhclient -- which took a very long time to run, and had another probably unrelated process die in the interim -- and  got an IPv4 address and the correct /etc/resolv.conf.  Syslog shows that many of the processes started by dbus failed to activate.\nA Google search shows that this problem is not unique to Ubuntu, but also affects at least Red Hat and Debian, and has been for a year or more. Clearly the upstart/dbus mechanism is not quite ready for prime time.\n\nA: Okay. So, I checked the /etc/network/interfaces file and apparently, all the newline characters had been replaced with the letter \"n\".

Well, first of all, change is inevitable and mostly good. Furthermore attempts at simplifying the User Interface such as Gnome 3, Unity to make Linux more inclusive hold much promise, even though they adversely affect my style of working.\nAdditionally, though now retired, I have worked with computers for 47 years, and though I do nothing serious for others now, I still do heavy duty things.\n10.04 LTS is my big workstation, and I had three 10.10 systems for Mythtv, and one of which is further adapted for video & related.  The Mythtv were 10.10 because of a dormant bug regarding installing to 10.04.\nMy work habits consistently use dual monitors, compiz cube and 3D windows with the computing horsepower to support them.\nThe dual monitors with separate X screens has been not been functional since 11.04, and cube/3D windows not functional in Unity, and with diminished functionality Gnome.\nThere is a bug filed (after upgrade to 12.04 amd64 Gnome Classic not properly draw second screen) \nI have mitigated the situation some by switching to Xubuntu and eschewing Unity.\nThe question that comes to mind is why this bug is not given more attention in that it nearly cuts functionality in half for more competent workstations.\nSample Xubuntu 12.04 workspace...\n\nPlease know that I appreciate all the hard work and dedication required to pull off something as big as Ubuntu, et al.\n\nA: I think the reason for the priority set to low is for a few reasons. \n1) You're talking about functionality that isn't part of the Core Ubuntu experience. Unity is fully supported by Canonical and is what they are pushing (see removing Kubuntu developer). Gnome Shell and Gnome Classic aren't something that they support at all, so that can contribute to the priority.\n2) There aren't that many people affected by it. Looking at the \"heat\" of that bug you listed, it's 54, with puts you in the top 25% of bug heat against Compiz, but just barely. There are many more bugs with quite a bit more heat than that one. (The top bug has 1214 heat). There are only X amount of developers, and most of them aren't paid. Their resources are focused where they can do the most good.\n3) It was initially marked low due to missing information, then never updated. Although had it been updated, I wouldn't put it higher than medium.\n4) I don't use separate X screens myself, nor do I use compiz cube. I do have twinview setup with my two monitors and Unity and it works fine for me. I'd imagine that my setup is more common than yours, also contributing to the bug priority.\n", "Q: Launchpad fails to build a package for my PPA I'm trying to build a package on Launchpad's Debian build system for PPAs but I'm having some issues with a certain package. \nThe package I'm trying to build (zorin-xwinwrap) contains a source C file which I'm trying to get to compile and build on Launchpad's server so that it would install and work on 32 bit (i386) and 64 bit (amd64) systems.

How do I set up GRUB to display on 2 monitors?\nI have a laptop plugged in to a external monitor. Most of the time, I leave the laptop closed, and just use the monitor, but when I boot up, I have to open the lid to select GRUB boot option.\nI don't want to set the config to be only the external monitor in case I am not plugged in to one. So I figure a mirrored config would be best.\nI have an NVidia m360 card if info is required. \n\nA: GRUB displays on the monitor that is given to it by the hardware and as far as I know it can only be one at that point in the boot process.\nYour laptop might have a function button that lets you choose the output a bit more easily for when you don't have the extra monitor attached and it may even default back to the laptop display if it doesn't see an external monitor. The only way to really know though is to give it a try.\n", "Q: Computer is randomly shutting down. What could be? I'm having some problems, my computer is shutting down at random intervals, but from today it started to shut off rigth after the login screen.\nIt's a Toshiba Laptop. I thought it was the cpu overheating, but it's not. I tried also different RAMs and it won't work either.\nThen I was thinking that it could be related to the ACPI but I tried adding the \"acpi=off\" in the boot/kernel and it shut off again.\nSo I really have no idea about what's happening. I still can boot in recovery mode but with the CLI only, as soon as I issue \"startx\" it'll shut down, sometimes instantly and other times after 1 o 2 minutes.\nOther thing I tried was booting live from an USB drive. It also shut down, after the GUI showed and the drive lost its booting capabilities.\nDo you have any ideas?\n\nA: Maybe it's not the CPU overheating, but still the CPU. What you describe is exactly what I experienced a couple of weeks ago. I then ran memtest and everything, even plugged in a graphics card (as prior to boot the screen was messed up, sometimes instead of shutting down it simply froze). Finally I booted from several CDs to make sure it was not the installation messed up. Trying with a Linux Mint 12 CD lying around, it booted in text mode and there it was: The big error message which never made it into any log file, CPU0 being out of sync, kernel panic. So try booting from a CD and see what is displayed on the console (I didn't see that when booting from the hard disk into recovery mode of Ubuntu, but that may have been sheer accident).\n", "Q: How to replace a PAE kernel with non PAE Kernel? After reading the information from my Question pros/cons of PAE , i want to remove PAE kernel because i don't need them . I know removing  a kernel from Synaptic Package Manager . Thats easy job but how to get Non-PAE kernel of current ? \n\nA: To install a different kernel (such as a non-pae kernel), you would need to install the package for it. Use your favourite package manager (like Synaptic) to install linux-image-generic, or use this command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic\n\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 or earlier version, this will install the latest generic kernel that is not pae. Then you would need to reboot and in the grub menu select the non-pae kernel. Once it boots up, verify everything is working. \nIn Ubuntu 12.10 or later version, this will NOT work since linux-image-generic is equivelent to linux-image-generic-pae.\nOptional: You can remove the other kernel once you know everything is working with the new kernel by doing\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-generic-pae\n\n", "Q: How do I install Intel ethernet drivers? I just bought a Lenovo T420, I booted the live CD and couldn't connect to my wireless router so I figured I needed the drivers for it. I have the last version of Ubuntu(12.04).\nIt's a \nIntel® 82579 Gigabit Ethernet Controller\nSo I went on intel's website and downloaded the Drivers for Linux and compiled them with make install. Here's the tutorial I followed:\nLinux Driver Install\n\nI have a few question though, \nWhat are these doing : \n\nmodprobe e1000e\n  ifconfig eth0 up\n  dhclient eth0\n  ping intel.com\n\nAs far as what I've read, modprobe seems to add the driver to the list of drivers for the kernel, but is that operation only good for one session?\nThe two other lines, I don't understand either what they are doing.\nWhat does he mean at the end when he mentions :\n\nNote: Whenever the kernel version is upgraded you will need rebuild this driver.\n\nAnd are these steps permanent? Or do I have to add them to some boot.conf file for everytime I boot. \nAnyways, the steps worked for me and I have established a connection with my router, I just need to know if I need to do additional steps to keep the driver permanently etc.\n\nA: modprobe program to add and remove modules from the Linux Kernel. You can find more details using command man modprobe.\nifconfig eth0 up - It is same as enable a Ethernet device in windows.\ndhclient eth0 is to get dynamic ip from your router.\nping intel.com to confirm that you can connect to intel.com i.e. Internet.\nNow to do a modprobe automatically, edit rc.local file. rc.local file is special file that runs when you logon.\nSo run this command,\ngksu gedit /etc/rc.local\nat the end of this file before the line exit 0 enter a line like this\nmodprobe e1000e\nexit 0\n\nWhat the thing is kernel update and blah blah..\nKernel is the core of any operating system. So if the core changes all drivers must be compatible with it. Ubuntu provides update of kernels for stability and security. The kernel version is mentioned in grub menu like this text 3.2.0-25-generic . As you are building the driver yourself so any with any change in kernel you have to recompile the driver to make it compatible and include in this new kernel.basically you have to do the steps you did before modprobe. :)\nLet me know if you need more clarification. \n\nAnyway, did you check Additional drivers (press Win and type it), Ubuntu community might provide the drivers. In that case you don't need to do anything. It will be updated and maintained automatically.\n", "Q: How do I fix \"sorry, a problem occurred while installing software blcr-dkms\"?

I followed the instructions in Ubuntu Getting Set-Up Guide and Launchpad guide.\nAccordingly I received a mail in my GMail account (I had used GMail for registering in Launchpad), and I copied the PGP contents and pasted in the terminal in gpg command. This is the output I got,\nuser: \"abc <def@gmail.com>\"\n4096-bit RSA key, ID ABCD1234, created 2012-06-15 (main key ID EFGH5678)\ngpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID ABCD1234, created 2012-06-15\n      \"abc <def@gmail.com>\"\nThe gpg program is not exiting after this.\nAfter this, the Guide just asks us to go and confirm the PGP key in the Launchpad page. But I don't see any such link there.\nAm I doing something wrong here? How does running gpg on my computer inform launchpad if the key is valid or not?\n\nA: The encrypted message you have received contains the instructions for confirming that the PGP key you have registered is yours. In order to follow the instructions, you will have to decrypt it.\nAfter you have pasted your encrypted text into gpg, try ctrl-D ; this informs programs eating STDIN (the terminal input) that you have finished.\nUpon Decryption, the decrypted message will have a link, which you must visit and click the Confirm button there. \nSee : http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2003-October/020558.html\nAlternately, you could install the Enigmail addins for Thunderbird and read the mail using that.\n", "Q: Some videos have no thumbnail?

Ubuntu 11.10 had Unity by default, and the applications lens of the dash hasn't really changed. The only big difference I can see is that 12.04 no longer has the \"home\" screen of the dash. It just defaults to recent search results, I think.\n\nA: 12.04 already looks like 11.10.  \nWith regards to your menu system looks, maybe you were using a different GTK theme. \nWhy not explore some of the other themes that ship with 12.04.

Is there a way to load the terminal and reload the desktop. If this was windows I'd use cntrl alt delete and run explorer to fix the desktop.\n\nA: I am still searching for this answer myself. For the time being on the login page before you enter your password and boot into Ubuntu, click on the Ubuntu symbol and there should be two options, \"Ubuntu\" and \"Ubuntu 2D\". If you pick the 2D option then you can see everything in a less graphical mode. Still looks great and runs faster than Windows!\nI'll update if I find out how to fix the compiz-core and libglib packages.\n\nA: That answer helped as far as it went.  Once I logged in using Ubuntu 2D, I went to system settings and checked for upgrades.  Apparently I had not installed upgrades when I installed the system.  Once I installed system upgrades through an internet connection, I was able to tun Ubuntu normally.\nLook to see if you have installed system upgrades once you log in under 2D.\nThis is good for me, as I am recovering an older box that still has some life left.\n", "Q: Is using Ubuntu 10.10 still a viable option? I fell in love with Ubuntu when version 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) was released. I want to stick to it, since I like it a lot more than the 11 and 12 series.\n(2011/11 Series: 11.04 - Natty Narwhal, 11.10 - Oneiric Ocelot | 2012/12 Series: 12.04 LTS - Precise Pangolin, 12.10 - Quantal Quetzal)\nMy question is, since its not currently supported (support ended on April 10, 2012), what problems will I face? \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Will I be eligible for distibution upgrade? (e.g. from 10.10 to 11.10) I mean at least until the next Ubuntu distribution was supported\n  \n*Can I somehow get security updates and patches?\n  \n*Will the latest software still be available on Ubuntu 10.10? I don't care much about drivers, I care about Python, PHP, Apache, Wine and other software.\n  \n*Will the Ubuntu Software Center work, and will there be updates?\n  \n*What issues am I most prone to face?\n  \n\n\nA: It would be better if you installed Ubuntu 10.04 because Canonical will support it with updates until April 2013. I myself hated Ubuntu 11.10 because of its glitches, but then i did a fresh install with 12.04 and I'm loving it so far. \nInstalling anything older then 10.04 is completely unnecessary because there is no support along with it. Also if you are a person who likes old versions so much and you wont mind using Ubuntu server edition, you can try Ubuntu 8.04 Server Edition. It will also be supported by Canonical until April 2013. Make your choice, and good luck.\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.10 is already End-of-Life, meaning there will be no more security or other updates for it.\nAlso, newer versions of software won't necessarily run on 10.10 easily, no. Most will require newer underlying core libraries.\nIs there any particular reason to not install 12.04? It was just released a couple months ago, and will be supported until April 2017.\n\nA: Answers by number:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, you can update to the latest updates made before it went EOL, but it's a hassle to do as you need to switch to the old-releases repository.\n\n*No, security updates are not going to be released even though there are known security vulnerabilities\n\n*No, newer software will require newer libraries, and new software won't be packaged for EOL releases.\n\n*You may not care about drivers, but they won't be updated. And neither will any of the software you listed, so still not looking great.\n\n*Software Center might technically work (after changing repositories manually), but updates won't as no updates are being provided.\n\n*All of the issues mentioned above, and the fact that most people aren't willing to support EOL releases, so when you run into any problem don't expect to get support for fixing it from here or most other support venues.\n\n\nBased on all that, I'd say that the answer to your main question, \"Is installing Ubuntu 10.10 still a viable option?\" is a resounding NO.\nBased on some of your comments here, it sounds like you may be happier with the 12.04 releases of Xubuntu, which uses a more GNOME2 like UI and has a less resource intensive DE than Ubuntu, or Lubuntu, which doesn't have a very GNOME2 like UI, but will be blazing fast (at least when using the applications which come with it) on even decade old hardware. Both Xubuntu and Lubuntu use the same repositories as Ubuntu, the only difference is the set of applications installed by default. So you can still use Ubuntu Software Center and install any software you want.\n\nA: I understand what you mean when you say that 11 and 12 went the wrong way. I once tried switching back to 10.10, however, I had to look for another distro for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not possible to update anymore (it seemed as if I couldn't even get the updates for the 10.10 version)\n\n*New programs will not necessarily work as some of them may need certain library versions, while the existing ones are out-of-date.\n\n*It's much more worthwhile to return to 10.04 for the time being. As long as you want to keep away from the newer 11 and 12 Ubuntus (avoiding bloat is always a good idea), the LTS Lucid Lynx will serve your needs well for a year or so.\n\n\nIf you wish to stick to a stable distro, I recommend choosing something of a more lightweight nature, such as some debian-based distro. I myself am using Crunchbang and I can easily recommend it to anyone - the current stable release doesn't really differ at all from the testing branch (yes, it's a debian-based linux) in terms of appearance and performance (around 80 MB of RAM used on startup), therefore it is easy to notice that this is much more stable - unlike mainstream Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, which are always trying to catch up with the trends.\nCrunchbang is just an example, you may wish to review the lightweight versions of Linux Mint (namely LXDE desktop) or others which also give you a choice of a more resource-hungry desktop. Recommendation: stick to lightweight window managers as they are stable, do not consume much resources (if any at all given today's computers' specs) and, if configured right, look rather elegant with minimal compositing and a nice GTK skin (that is why I use crunchbang, it has a default selection of great themes).\nTo add to 10.10, it's kernel version is a bit dated and you would probably want either the latest 2.6 release or the 3.x kernel (10.10, as far as I remember, uses the older 2.6 release).\n", "Q: How to Send Files to My Computer via Bluetooth? I can pair my HTC One X with Ubuntu, but I can't send any files to my computer from my phone. Every time I try my phone reports the transfer failed and I never get prompted by the computer to accept the file. \n\nA: Search for \"Personal file sharing\".  Then activate \"Receive files over Bluetooth\".  That is it, worked for me.  \n\nA: I would like to share one method on how to send files from any Android smartphone to Ubuntu. I successfully tested it myself on Ubuntu 12.10 laptop with built-in bluetooth adapter and SGS4 smartphone.\nYour smartphone and Ubuntu computer should be paired.\nOpen a terminal application (Ctrl+Alt+T) and install obexftp and obexpushd packages from OpenOBEX project using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install obexftp obexpushd\n\nSet your computer's bluetooth adapter into discoverable mode executing the following command:\nsudo hciconfig hci0 piscan\n\nRun obexpushd command and listen to the incoming bluetooth connection:\nobexpushd -B\n\nNow it is possible to send any file from the smartphone to Ubuntu computer. The files will be stored in your /home/username or /home/username/Downloads directory. \nI tested the method by sharing a file through bluetooth from ASTRO File Manager on Android smartphone.\nThe main credit for this method goes to the blog post.\n\nA: Open up the file browser, then find the icon for your phone on the side, click on it and find the file using the computer.\nThen just drag to where you want it.\nMay not work for you but worth a try.\n\nA: I installed blueman for any bluetooth connection, because on every pc with ubuntu i tried to use it, it didn't work. \nGive it a try\nsudo apt-get install blueman\n\nAnd then start it. It should now be on the startup applications list. \nIt's lot more comfortable and customizable than the stock obex. \n", "Q: Why does my Lubuntu Software Centre only show installed apps? The title is self explanatory but here is a big screenshot to emphasize what I mean\n\nAs you can see I have the Get Software tab open with the all section selected.\nAny suggestions? \n\nA: As Jokerdino suggested I reinstalled the software centre from synaptic and all is well. I think actually I could have gotten away with doing a \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lubuntu-software-center \nwould have worked as well.\nThanks for the suggestions. \n\nA: Try typing a program's title in the search field and you should be able to find new programs. Lubuntu's software center is not the same as in Ubuntu, therefore it is possible that you might face such difficulties. If it's the program's fault, you could try installing the Ubuntu Software Center (this is a workaround though, not a fix for the Lubuntu Software center).\nAlso, you may be interested in reading this for further information: click here\nIf you don't want to install another software center, I would suggest to reinstall Lubuntu - that is a \"nuclear-bomb\" approach though.\n\nA: I'm not sure if LSC updates its package information when it starts, but it definitely checks what's already there. If it doesn't automatically update, then it may need to be manually spurred by either running your Update Manager and checking for new packages or manually updating the package info by using sudo apt-get update from the command line. Then launch LSC to see if it has other programs available for you. All this assumes you have access to the internet, because without that there's not really a way for the system to check for new packages.\n", "Q: Dell Precion m6600 touch screen cursor problems I have a Dell Precision M6600 and installed Ubuntu 12.04. The cursor jumps around all by itself when I'm not even touching the keyboard. When I try to type the cursor goes crazy and clicks and jumps all over the place making it impossible to type; eventually it freezes and I can't type, click or use the key board. Any ideas on how to fix this?\n\nA: I had this same problem and it took me weeks to figure out what was going on.  I thought it was an issue with the mouse, the touchpad, etc.  \nFinally it dawned on me -  its the stinking touchscreen (not sure why Dell decided it would be a good idea to put a touchscreen a desktop replacement laptop). \nIn any event, you can disable the touchscreen using xinput.

Dell came and replaced the touchscreen, touchpad, keyboard, motherboard, and some electronic harnesses to no avail. It's practically a new computer now! I've upgraded all the drivers and still have the problem.\nOne workaround is: go to Control Panel, select \"N-Trig DuoSense Digitizin Settings\"; on the Digitazer options tab, select \"Pen Only\" and click apply. This eliminates and disables the touchscreen via human touch but still active by stylus. Not sure what the real solution is, but sure hope someone figures out the real problem. It used to work nicely and now this problem which even Dell hasn't been able to fix.\n\nA: Juan, do you have the nvidia graphics card?  That's what I have.  I think it's a problem with the graphics drivers.  T\nhe cursor goes especially crazy when the background is black or a very dark color. I've installed Ubuntu 12.04, OpenSuse 12.1 and 12.2, Fedora 17, Ubuntu Studio 12.04 thinking that one of the operating systems might solve the crazy cursor jumping promblem which it did as long as I left the nouveau drivers, As soon as I install the orginal nvidia drivers to expoit the grahics card as much as I can because I work with 3d animation, the cursor starts to go nuts again. \nI tested the all the versions of the ndvidia drivers, including older versions.  It seems as though nvidia doesn't give any support whatsoever.\n", "Q: Which other \"photo booth\" program can I use besides cheese (on a Toshiba AC100)?

So I was wondering if there is a way I can do the same (see Ubuntu from my mac) using the router as an intermediary without using the internet. I checked this post Sharing desktop with OSX in LAN but its not very clear to me whether there is an option.\n\nA: First you need to find the IP address of your Linux computer on the local network. You can use the Network Tools program on Ubuntu of if you are comfortable with the command line then you can use run \"ifconfig\" and look for the inet address.

I'm specifically interested in this for desktop, not laptop, computers.\n\nA: I recommend them in the following order according to problems found, how the \"out of the box\" experience feels to end users, how compatible it is and how it will feel once you have it set up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel - Works out of the box PERFECT. Most if not all will just work with no problems. Great for using a Video Beam or another video output. Just plug and done. Feels good also. Of course the benefit relates to how fast the Intel card is. I would not recommend an Intel old 440 to a more recent Core 2 Duo and up versions. In general you should not have any problems with them.\n\n*NVIDIA - Great Performance with Unity. It works out of the box for most Nvidia cards by using Nouveau and if you install the easy to install proprietary drivers it will feel perfect. Has little problems that can be quickly solved if you happen to have some of the cards that have small details (Which can also be solved if you update 12.04 with the latest updates). Most cards work excellent with Unity. I have tested cards starting from a Geforce 4600 TI 128MB up to a 560 TI 1GB.\n\n*ATI - Also great performance with Unity. It works out of the box although not most as mentioned with Nvidia. If you install the proprietary drivers you will get a good jump in performance but again, this is not as generally mentioned as Nvidia. My curiosity lies in that ATI is more open to the open source environment than Nvidia and yet has a bit more problems with video.\nSo in general if I had 3 laptops to choose from and they all were the same except for the video card, I would definitely choose Intel over Nvidia, and Nvidia over Ati.\nIn the case of 3 Desktop PCs that are the same except for the video card I would choose Nvidia over Intel and Intel over Ati.\nThis is just from several years of good, neutral and bad experiences. \nFor cases where you have 2 integrated video cards (Nvidia and Intel or Ati and Intel). The performance benefit is not as important as how well the video cards behave on Low power, high heat situations. For information regarding this I always point to Bumblebee or Ironhide?\nIn general, Ubuntu will work without problems or at least with a minimal of tweaking. The performance gain in the past months for all 3 video card types and the amount of fixes they have received just lets us know that there will be fewer problems for each new version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I think any of them has enough \"grunt\" for Unity.\nThe Intel devices probably have the best driver support in Linux, because the Intel drivers are Open Source. If you don't need lots of power for 3D apps and games, Intel graphics are probably sufficient, and even preferable, and certainly more economical as they come built into many motherboards.\n\nA: Unity should run fine with any of those drivers.\nGenerally, the proprietary -fglrx and -nvidia have higher levels of OpenGL support than the corresponding open source options, -amd and -nouveau, particularly so for newer hardware.  The Unity guys did a lot of the initial development with -nvidia since it had better OpenGL than the others.\n-intel is a good driver, but it's OpenGL support has tended to lag that of the other drivers.  However this has improved a lot lately and for Unity's purposes should be more than adequate in Precise.\n\nA: the answer is a little complicated, but goes like this:\nnVidia's open-source driver is really bad (thanks to them being stubborn), but their proprietary driver gives pretty much the best performance of any GPU on linux.\nAMD's open-source driver is better, but still not really good enough to match your investment in a modern video card, so you'll end up resorting to their proprietary driver, which is not as good as nVidia's.\nso: if you're serious about wanting to go entirely open-source, AMD is a slightly better option (though still dissatisfying -- honestly, Intel graphics are probably the only ones whose open-source driver compares well to their Windows performance nowadays, and that wasn't true until 2012), but if you're willing to use proprietary drivers, nVidia is best.\nnote that this assumes that you're using <5 year old hardware, willing to spend north of $100 on your GPU, and have some interest in modern games.\n", "Q: How to run alias in background? Is it possible to run this u2be2mp3(){ youtube2mp3 \"$@\" > /dev/null;} in background?\nIt's part of the .bashrc, and if I use it this way: \n\"u2be2mp3(){ youtube2mp3 \"$@\" > /dev/null &;}\" \nI'll get a syntax error.\n\nA: It should work if you use the & instead of the ;, not both at the same time:\nu2be2mp3() { youtube2mp3 \"$@\" > /dev/null & }\n\nAlso, to be exact, that's a shell function, not an alias, and the above line runs the youtube2mp3 command in the background, not the function.

I have been struggling to get to 12.04 for one of my three systems supporting Mythtv. \nThere have been multiple false starts and not working functionality.\nFurthermore, Unity severely upsets my working style.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: Note: I have switched to Xubuntu from Ubuntu.  Originally I thought it was for older, less robust hardware but found it's avoidance of the \"advanced\" Ubuntu's complexity a blessing and a truly useful desktop for me. \nUpdate: I should have noted that this works for Ubuntu and Xubuntu, Xubuntu just being a plus. I removed Unity after final Xubuntu upgrade.\nNote: I upgraded a very simple 10.10 Ubuntu dedicated to an mythtv client to 12.04 without any problems.

Made sure grub2 was\ninstalled on MBR of disk containing the root partition.  Down loaded\nand burned the boot-repair disc (10.10 uses a different version of grub2\nthan later).\n\n*Installed Xubuntu desktop.\n\n*Used Software sources to find a server.\n\n*Ran sudo update-grub\n\n*Used Update-manager to do a release-upgrade to 11.04. Removed Unity. Fully updated and set restricted nvidia driver.  Reset compiz settings to my standard set (cube with 3D windows).

No need to remove Unity. Fully updated and set restricted nvidia driver.  Reset compiz settings to my standard set.  Reinstalled Mythtv client.  Made a separate back-up of root and home.\nNotes:\nIf upgrade to 11.04 fails (mine did), you may have to restore the MBR grub, hence the burned boot-repair disc.\nI found that during download of the release upgrade packages the download would hang.  If still downloading, it can be stopped and software sources used to find another server.\nI found best practice to switch to the main Ubuntu server when not able to complete download, often slow but sure.\nI am blessed with reliable high speed INTERNET access, but still had download problems.\nDuring the upgrades, I found duplicated sources (usually \"Canonical partners\"...) which I reduce to a single one using software-sources.\nI did my upgrades with a dual boot 10.04 (helpful when backing up and restoring but troublesome with grub2.  If you use live CD, make sure you have one for each release, 10.10, 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04. \nEach upgrade step took a minimum of two hours, and the upgrades stops when it asked you a question, so prepared to be bored.\nThe 11.10 to 12.04 upgrade has a bug wherein the upgrade ask you a question but you can only see it if you have \"terminal\" opened, so open it, good idea far all upgrades.\nMake sure after each upgrade you back up well, because you may have to stay there awaiting things to be fixed.  Good idea to keep prior backups until the desired end result is reached.\nIn conclusion: If you are trying this and broach at a problem, ask a question on askubuntu and here leave a comment pointing to the question.

Frequently, there are some things we need to do, tweak system settings, execute some processes, however even on Ubuntu, sometimes there isn't a GUI to perform such tasks, which is why we come to places like Ubuntu forum, askubuntu or even search on Google.\nThen someone provides us a terminal command that allows us to do whatever we need at that moment to solve a certain problem. So I see that learning the language behind Linux can be extremely useful. But all I've been doing so far is to execute the commands, sometimes I don't even understand what I'm doing while executing them, I am just following instructions from someone else.\nI would like to understand more about Linux in general and Ubuntu in particular, I don't want to master Linux or run everything on terminal, I like Ubuntu just fine for modern PC's, user-centric and graphical, but I just would like to know the basics and at least to be able to understand what a certain command is going to do on the system.\nWhat is the best way to do this?\n\nA: Read about bash, which is the commandline shell.  If you ever used MS-DOS, it's similar.  Most of the commands you use are fairly straight-forward: it starts with a command followed by a space.  The command can be either an internal bash command, or an external program/command.  If it's external, it needs to be where bash can find it, either in the path or specified.\nAfter the command, there are often options, that are command-specific.  After the options, there may be filenames required.  Keep in mind that spaces separate items in this list, so if a filename has a space, it need to be \"escaped\", like this: name\\ with\\ spaces.  Each space has a backslash in front of it to make it a character rather than a delimiter.  Usually, you can also put double quotes around the name, instead.\nIf it's a bash command, you can find out more in a few ways:\nEnter man name_of_command, where\n   name_of_command is the program name. Use spaces to page through the text, 'b' to page backwards, and 'q' to quit.\nEnter name_of_command --help to get an abbreviated list of options\nYou can get a lot of information by entering \"man man\", and also \"man bash\".  But some simpler tutorials are helpful to get you started.\nSo, next time you see a command, try entering the first word after the \"man\" command, or enter the first word, followed by --help to get a feeling for what the parameters are.\nAfter learning the bash command line, you will be more able to experiment with some more advanced topics. There are lots of linux tutorials on the web. \n\nA: *\n\n*Linux in a nutshell is said to be a good book for Linux commands. You can see that book. (I admit that I did not completely read the book, but seems to me good for commands, See below comment from an actual reader)\n\n*An online directory of useful Linux commands can also help you a lot\n\n*I found the book Ubuntu Linux Bible extremely helpful and a friendly introduction to Ubuntu. It is by \"William von Hagen\". \n\n*You can browse the Linux manual pages in a web-browser by installing man2html.\nsudo apt-get install man2html\n\n\n*You can browse the GNU info pages by typing info following the command name in a terminal.

I just installed the Jon Severinsson ffmpeg PPA, and I cant watch any video and get audio only, I get a need extra plugins needed install? and then packaged dependencies could no be resolved . Here are the screenshots, any help?\n\n\n\nA: Jon Severinson's ffmpeg is NOT Ubuntu's ffmpeg!\n\n\n*\n\n*Last year, some of the ffmpeg developers split off and started their own version (\"fork\") of ffmpeg, called libav. For various reasons, Ubuntu ended up choosing libav as the version to include in Ubuntu 12.04. See this question for more info.\n\n*Both ffmpeg and libav are actively developed, in parallel, right now. Jon's PPA contains the latest original ffmpeg packages, not the libav ones (which are in the official Ubuntu repository)\n\n*Both sets of packages have different, incompatible and confusing versioning schemes -- and this is a problem because they also share some of the same components, dependencies, etc. due to their shared heritage. libav 0.8.x is as \"new\" as ffmpeg 0.10.x!\n\n*Right now, Ubuntu applications are set to depend on the libav versions of software.\n\n*But when you install Jon's ffmpeg, Software Center/apt gets confused because the audio/video player needs dependencies, but different versions of those are already installed!\n\n*Bottom line: if you install Jon's ffmpeg, you have to be prepared to separately install or build from source your preferred audio/video players. ffmpeg and libav cannot co-exist on an Ubuntu installation at this time (unless you install one of them manually).\n\n*So, unless you need some particular feature only implemented by ffmpeg, stick to libav since it's the officially supported fork and is as new and actively developed as ffmpeg.\n\nA: Getting the real ffmpeg to work right is simple:\nSee this solution -- and it auto-updates using the Jon Severinsson PPA.\n@izx correctly points out that ffmpeg can not coexist with libav, but the advice in his last bullet, \"...stick to libav since it's the officially supported fork and is as new and actively developed as ffmpeg,\" may not be best. At least in Precise, I find the real ffmpeg superior.\nThe answer to your question, @Gabriel Rojas (cc @nitstorm, @Eliah Kagan), is that one can not simply add the ffmpeg repo and update. The train wreck shown in the OP is to be expected if this is done. Instead, libav must first be purged, THEN the real ffmpeg can be installed, and should work without error. See the above link for step-by-step commands.\nSince doing this a couple days ago, have pushed the new ffmpeg hard -- and found it flawless.\n\nLast activity here was some time ago, but this thread comes up high in the search rank so wanted to update with a solution that works.\n", "Q: How to install Bastion from .sh file? \nI have downloaded Bastion from HIB V; though, when I execute the .sh file in Terminal, nothing happens.

It's essentially a window that Wine is constrained to. You can do this on an application-by-application basis or you can do it for everything.\nThe nice thing about both approaches is that if the resolution is equal to the resolution of a screen, it's displayed in fullscreen mode (without decorations, above panels, etc) so it appears to take over a whole screen, without bodging around the actual display settings.\nJust one application\nChange your launcher to something like this:\nwine explorer /desktop=LIMBO,1920x1200 \"C:\\Program Files\\LIMBO\\LIMBO.exe\"\n\nIn the /desktop=LIMBO,1920x1200 part, LIMBO is just the title for the window and 1920x1200 is the resolution.\nFor everything in a Wine prefix\nRun winecfg and go to the Graphics tab. Check the \"Emulate a virtual desktop\" and enter a resolution. From now on when you run something in that prefix, it'll load in a virtual desktop.\n\nI personally use a mix. My default Wine prefix doesn't force it all the time but there are some single applications I run through explorer /desktop....

Have you configured Virtualbox for sharing the directories, in \"Devices => Shared Folders?\"  That is necessary for the guest to see the shared directories, although there may be other ways to set up the network.  Then, if it doesn't work, you may need to install Samba on Ubuntu - I'm not sure if it's installed by default or not.\nFor more information on configuring the samba server on the host, you can take a look at this article.  Usually, all you need to do is edit /etc/samba/smb.conf to add the name of the computer and the network, which defaults to \"Workgroup\", but should match the name of the windows network.  These two lines in [global] are the ones that set it:\n   workgroup = workgroup-name\n   netbios name = server-name\n\n\nA: I think, you just want to have a common folder where both the os can share their data.\nTo do this, you would need to install samba server on your Ubuntu host. Find more info here - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba/SambaServerGuide#Ubuntu_Server (read only the ubuntu section. Its very easy.) Once you have done that and you have some folders to share, make sure that both machines can find each other on the lan (see this question - Connecting 2 ubuntu machines as a LAN).\nFinally, go to 'my computer' on your windows host and map a network drive ( http://compnetworking.about.com/od/windowsxpnetworking/ht/mapnetworkdrive.htm ), which will be the one of your ubuntu host.\nNow you can share data between both your machines.\n", "Q: What quickly templates are available How to get list of official an unofficial quickly templates.

Could I plug in my Android phone into my Ubuntu PC via USB cable and have text messages and such appear in my Ubuntu notifications? Or something like that (similar to the Ubuntu for Android application being developed, except I could plug my phone into my PC which is already running Ubuntu).\n\nA: This can be achieved with 'Android Notifier' application.\nThe application is simple in premise: when your phone receives texts, incoming calls, media messages, voice-mail or other relevant alerts it pushes these notifications to your Ubuntu screen via Bluetooth or WiFi so that you don’t miss them.The service displays notifications using the systems default notification service(notify-osd in case of ubuntu).\nPhone-call notification:\n\nSMS Notification:\n\n\nHow-To Setup (Tested only on Ubuntu Natty & Ubuntu Precise):\nOn Desktop:\nIt requires java.You can get it from here.\nInstall 'android notifer' on your desktop from here. After installing it , start the application (from accessories/android notifier desktop or search it in dash).It is still using using old gnome-panel notification area applet.So the indicator doesn't appear on unity panel. To run the configuration-window press  Alt+F2 & type /usr/share/android-notifier-desktop/run.sh -p. This will open Android notifier preference.\n\nIf you want to use notify-osd select libnotify also install libnotify-bin package(sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin). Initially set 'receive notification from any device' from device menu.\n\nOn Android:\nFirst install android notifier from here. or from the android market.\n\nStart the application.Go to 'notification method' If you want to wifi (Both your laptop & phone has to be connected on the same wifi netwok.), select wifi, or if you want to use  bluetooth select bluetooth.If you want to use your 3g network or over usb select the option accordingly. Get more help from here.\nYou can select events to notify under main menu->events to notify section.The default options are: Phone Ring, SMS, MMS, Battery, Voicemail etc.\n\nWifi Setup:\nGo to IP/Wifi Option:\nUnder target IP address select 'custom or host'.\nUnder custom ip address(es) type your ip address. To view your ip address click network manager on the panel & select connection information.\nUnder Network protocol section make all the three options(send with udp, send with tcp, sendover cell network) are selected. \nNow go back to main menu & click 'Send test notification' to check whether it is working properly.If everything runs smoothly you will get a test notification as notify-osd bubble.\n\nBluetooth Setup(Recommended):\nIf you already paired your device delete pairing.

I want to start contributing to Ubuntu projects and while going through the Beginner's guide, I noticed that the suggested VCS for Ubuntu development is Bazaar.\nI currently use Git and find it very easy to work with.\nIn such a case, would it be wise for me to adopt Bazaar for my Ubuntu projects.\nIn what ways, if any, is Bazaar better than Git?\n\nA: As is often the case, the answer is \"it depends.\" It depends on exactly what kinds of contributions you are hoping to make. Ubuntu is a vast project made of many different software packages.\nSome, like Unity or Software Center, are developed as part of the Ubuntu project. The \"upstream\" code lives in bazaar repositories, and the best way to contribute to those projects will be by proposing merges on Launchpad. Their development models are closely tied to this process with continuous integration tests run on each commit before it lands into trunk.\nFor most other software packages, Ubuntu is simply the \"downstream.\" This software is either packages by Ubuntu developers or comes by way of Debian. The upstream development of these thousands of packages is of course done in many different VCSs, from CVS to git. For example, GNOME projects all live in git.  In order to work on these packages in a unified way using a DVCS, Ubuntu needed to make a choice. The choice of bazaar makes sense for us for a number of reasons. The fact that Canonical is the corporate sponsor of both Ubuntu and Bazaar was obviously a main factor. Ubuntu benefits from this greatly as Bazaar upstream resources are often used to specifically work on integrating with Ubuntu and pain points Ubuntu developers identify. Bazaar and Launchpad are already tied closely together. As Ubuntu already used Launchpad for bug tracking, it makes sense to keep development centralized there.\n\n\n*\n\n*So, if you are planning of contributing to one of the projects that\nUbuntu is the \"upstream\" for, Bazaar is certainly the way to go.\n\n*If you are developing your own software that you hope to include in\nUbuntu, you can use any VCS you want.\n\n*If you want contribute to packaging software and making fixes to packages in Ubuntu,  the packages are all imported into Bazaar repositories, but you do not need to use those if you aren't comfortable with it. This is done to give people that want it the power of a DVCS, but you can still contribute by so-called \"traditional packaging methods\" for lack of a better word. Before Bazaar was adopted for Ubuntu development, these were the typical methods for contributing to Ubuntu.\nAs to the question of in what ways is Bazaar better than Git, that seems to be a bit of a different question.\n", "Q: Adobe Air workaround for Pandora not working I was trying this symbolic link approach because of the problem described here:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/120221/70462\nAfter I made the symlink, the installation proceeded further than before, but it eventually asked for my password (in an extra small x-term window within the AIR installation window).

If it also helps to know, I am running a dual screen setup and most games seem to fullscreen to both monitors (as one big desktop).\n\nA: I found my solution.  The problem was that it was defaulting to fullscreen and that my fullscreen resolution was not a supported one.\nThe fix was to edit the /usr/share/applications/supermeatboy.desktop file and change the:\nExec=/opt/supermeatboy/SuperMeatBoy\n\nto:\nExec=/opt/supermeatboy/SuperMeatBoy -windowed -1024x768\n\nThe list of supported resolutions is:\n-640x480\n-800x600\n-1024x768\n-1280x720\n-1920x1080\n\n", "Q: Command not working Whenever I press Alt+F2 to open the Command window and I enter a command, such as reset --unity or 'sudo apt-get install startupmanager', no window pops up. Is this a glitch with Ubuntu, or am I overlooking something?\n\nA: The command actually runs, but you are not able to see it.\nIf it is a command that runs in a terminal, It is better to fire a terminal, (Shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T ) and run it there. Especially if you want to see the output, or if the command requires input.\nIf you are too lazy, for installing, you may use gksudo apt-get install -y <package name>, but be warned that -y means yes to all, so I am not to blame if your machine instantly vaporizes. And without -y; apt-get may expect you to accept additional dependencies, which is an input.. so you need a terminal.\nOn a sidenote, gksudo is the graphical counterpart or equivalent of sudo. it is to be used whenever you wish to launch a graphical program with administrative previliges, or can be used in dirty hacks as above.\nAnd its unity --replace that works. replace is a string manipulation utility.\n", "Q: How do I install lubuntu?

If you do a search for Synaptic in Ubuntu Software Center and it comes up you will see a message that says \"This software is available from universe source and a radio button on the left to \"use this source\"\nIf you click use this source it will enable it.\nThe other way to enable sources easily is to open the software center and  in the upper menu click edit>software sources it will look like this....\n\nAs you can see I have all mine enabled but you will only need to enable universe to get synaptic.  After you close the window you will need to run\nsudo apt-get update\n\nagain to get the new packages or wait for Software Center to update at it's next scheduled time.  You can then install Synaptic from the terminal as you tried before or from the Software Center.\nAs far as needing Synaptic, you can get along without it but I like it especially when I am trying to search for a technical thing that is hidden be default in Software Center and it gives you more information on the packages than Software Center and makes technical things a lot easier to uninstall the software sources easier to edit and can be updated without having to open a separate terminal just to run apt-get update. \n\nA: Try to install Synaptic from the Ubuntu Software Center instead of using the apt-get - this is how I installed it in version 12.04 with no problem.\nHowever I am on my v10.04 machine right now, so I couldn't tell why the apt-get didn't work for you - I just tried to apt-get on this older machine and it seems to work, so maybe Ubuntu took it out of the apt-get repository in v12, although this seems a bit strange - I would think this is something they would keep in the repo for quite some time, besides since libX11-dev package did the same thing, then I'd say it looks like your repositories list got either partially disabled or corrupted...\nBTW, I personally don't consider either Synaptic, the apt-get or the Software Center to be one better than the other - I've seen all of them failing to install something that the other 2 had no problem installing - you just have to try whatever works, or install it from the source if all 3 fail...\n\nA: You just need to update your apt-get .\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThis will work.\n", "Q: How to copy existing movie files on ipad to watch? I have an iPad and a desktop running Ubuntu 12.04 with lots of movie files of various formats (avi, mp4, m4v, etc).\nIs it possible to transfer those files from within linux directly to the iPad (without using iTunes to sync) over USB and then play those movies on the iPad without reformatting/resizing all of them?\nI've used iTunes in a Windows XP virtualbox instance with other iOS mobile devices before but I would prefer a pure linux approach if possible.\n(I'm creating this question so that I can share the solution I found because I failed to find a simple, satisfactory answer elsewhere).\n\nA: For Ubuntu 14.04 - iOS 8\nRob Van Dam's answer did not work for me.  \nDownload a file manager app from the App Store with sharing functionality, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Filemanager App has wifi web server functionality\n\n*FileBrowser App  handles the SMB protocol\n\n\nyou can upload and download your files that way.\n\nA: Yes, you can easily copy movies to an iPad (or other iOS device) in Ubuntu without using iTunes or Wifi or Dropbox or any of the other terrible solutions out there.\nFirst, simply choose one of the many video player apps available from within the App Store. (Searching for video player returns many irrelevant results, I recommend searching for avi player or mp4 player or whatever your desired format is).  I found flex:player and that has worked for my needs and is free but has pretty much no features beyond video playback.  Other players provide more features but can cost between $0.99 and $4.99 generally.\nSecond, plug your iPad into your computer via USB.  You should hopefully get a popup showing two mount points for your iPad.\n\n\n*\n\n*My iPad (or whatever your iPad's name is)\n\n*Documents on My iPad\n\n\nI believe this functionality goes as far back as 11.04 but at least back to 11.10.  See troubleshooting below if this does not happen.\nNavigate to 'Documents on My iPad' (again, your name will vary) and find the application you just installed.  It will look like an application with an icon but it is actually a folder for that app and its files (the user accessible ones at least).\n\nOpen that folder (i.e. double click on it) and then open the Documents folder within. \nNow all you have to do is copy your video files into this folder.  When you next open your chosen video player, all of your movies should be visible and available for playback (assuming the video player supports your codecs, if it doesn't, another one probably does).\nNote: I've generally found that if I load new video files onto the device while the app is open, I have to close and re-open the app for it to register the new files.  However, some apps may be more proactive in scanning for new files.\nTroubleshooting:\nIf your device is not automatically paired and mounted:\nMake sure you have libimobiledevice-utils and ifuse installed\nsudo apt-get install libimobiledevice-utils ifuse\n\nand then run\nidevicepair unpair && idevicepair pair\n\nand then disconnect and reconnect your device.\nIf you do not see video files you have copied\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you copied the files to the correct app's individual Documents folder.\n\n*Close and reopen the app to get it to refresh its file list.  \n\n*Read the app's documentation to ensure that the app you chose supports the video format and codec in question.\n\n\nA file is visible but does not play properly/at all\n\n\n*\n\n*Read the app's documentation to ensure that the app you chose supports the video format and codec in question.\n\n*If your video file is high resolution (such as 1080p), try a lower resolution file.  Some apps appear to have problems playing high definition video.  The older generation devices also sometimes have trouble because of their slower hardware.  You may be stuck downconverting to something more like 720p.  (But try a couple different apps first).\n\n\nA: If you do not see your application when navigating in your \"Documents on My iPad\" folder, you may need to show the hidden files CTRL-H.\n\nA: first time posting an answer here. apologies if i broke a site rule or something.\nif you don't have wifi at home or if you're not interested in spending $4.99 for an ipad app(when this was written), don't bother reading further.\ni have a solution, but it requires a local wifi network(not usb) and buying an app at the appstore.\nthe solution is to set your ubuntu machine as a server and connect to it with your ipad by ftp, allowing transfer of files to and from.\ni just made it work in under 5 minutes with my ubuntu13.10/ipad and less than 1 year experience with linux.\n\n\n*\n\n*go to the appstore from your ipad and install goodreader for ipad. this is the part and the only part where it costs $.\n\n*on your ubuntu install vsftpd from Ubuntu Software Center or in terminal run\nsudo apt-get install vsftpd\n\n\n*start vsftpd by running\nsudo /etc/init.d/vsftpd\n\nor\nservice vsftpd start\n\n\n*you should be able to find the inet address by running\nsudo ifconfig\n\n\n*with the inet address, your username, and your password, you can connect to your ubuntu machine from your ipad and download videos or any file by following these simple goodreader instructions.\n\n*to watch your video or open whatever file you downloaded, use the browser provided in the goodreader app.\ni'm just writing here what worked for me.\nif you have a better/cheaper way, post it here!\n", "Q: What is the default permission for /var/www?

Then any programs run by sh are automatically running as root.\n\n*Finally, you can pass the password twice to the separate programs:\necho password | sudo apt-get update && echo password | sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nA: I'm pretty sure the timeout for sudo is 15 minutes.\nYou can change that \nsudo visudo\n\nAdd the timeout to this line\nDefaults        env_reset\n\nSo for 20 minutes\nDefaults        env_reset,timestamp_timeout=20\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudoTimeout\n\nA: I'm on mobile now so can't write a detailed answer.

Since I don't have access to my Linux boxes now, I can't tell you how to do it, but you can try reading the man pages for sudoers, visudo, and anything referenced by those pages.\nWARNING: Doing this could potentially allow anyone to run any apt-get command.

I press ALT+F2 key on my keyboard, and get the launcher HUD up. From there I enter a command as I would in a shell, specifically vlc ~/Music/* -Z.

(No such file or directory)\nuser\nYour input can't be opened:\nVLC is unable to open the MRL 'file:///home/[username]/Music/%2A'. Check the log for details.\n\nI can't quite figure out what the difference is.\n\nA: Someone else pointed it out, but then removed their answer, so I'll add it again.\nThe reason this particular command fails is that the launcher doesn't use a shell, which means that VLC is literally trying to load a file named *, as opposed to globbing the star into a file list.\nA workaround is to call a shell instead, as elmicha pointed out in a comment. sh -c \"vlc ~/Music/* -Z\" would do this. This however fails due to a bug, again see elmichas comment.\nIn this particular case, since VLC will recursively traverse directories, the same result can be achieved with vlc ~/Music, which works fine without a shell, and is much simpler.\n", "Q: System does not hibernate; the screen flashes off for a few seconds and nothing else happens I just upgraded my Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04. I have a problem with hibernation in my new 12.04.\nI run the following command\nsudo pm-hibernate\n\nbut my system does not hibernate, i.e. my system does not turn off; rather the screen just flashes out for few seconds and resumes previous state.\nHow do I fix this problem and enable hibernation on my system?\n\nA: Something in your hardware configuration is incompatible with the kernel's hibernation methodology. Unfortunately this is hard to troubleshoot unless the troubleshooter happens to have a very similar system.\nYou can try the alternative TuxOnIce (wikipedia) hibernation instead. \n\n\n*\n\n*TuxOnIce (wiki|homepage) is an alternative to the kernel's built-in hibernation technology, and is supposed to be compatible with a broader range of hardware, more reliable and more flexible.\n\n*It is easily installed, and if it doesn't work for you, as easily removed.\n\n*It does require installing TuxOnIce's custom kernel, but the instructions that follow should make it easy. If you've never opened the terminal before, you may want to now :-)\n0. Requirements\nThe only requirement for TuxOnIce is that your swap partition be at least as large as the amount of memory (RAM) you have. You can check this by:\n\n*Start the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Type free -m, and you should see something like this:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          1024        731        260          0          0        190\n-/+ buffers/cache:        540        451\nSwap:         1536          6       1530\n\n\n*The number after Swap: (e.g. 1536) should be more than the number after Mem: (e.g. 1024)\n\n*If this is not the case, and your swap is smaller than your memory, you must either resize and increase the size of your swap partition, or configure TuxOnIce to use a special swap file. That is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you ask another question and mention it in the comments, I will answer and explain how.\n1. Installing the TuxOnIce kernel\n\n*Start the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Copy and paste the following into the terminal. This adds the TuxOnIce PPA and installs the custom kernel and headers.\n\n\n*\n\n*\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:tuxonice/ppa -y\n\nand once the ppa is added:\n\n*sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tuxonice-userui linux-generic-tuxonice -y \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic-tuxonice -y\n\n\n*Now reboot.\n\n*Ubuntu should now start up with the TuxOnIce kernel. If there are any problems, keep the Shift pressed at startup and you will get the Grub menu. Use the arrow keys to go to Previous Linux Versions, press enter, and press enter again to go back to the working kernel.\n2. Testing hibernation functionality.\n\n*Open some of the applications you normally use, e.g. Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreOffice, etc.\n\n*Open the terminal again, with Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Type sudo pm-hibernate, press enter, enter your password.\n\n*You should see the lock screen for a second, and then the TuxOnIce hibernation progress screen, like the one below:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If TuxOnIce works, your computer will shutdown.\n\n*Start it again, and wait. TuxOnIce should resume from the point you hibernated, including all the windows you opened at the position you opened.\n\n\n*If all this worked, go to Step 3, which lets you enable Hibernate from the dashboard.\n3. Enabling hibernation from the dashboard\n\n*Press Alt+F2, type the below and then press enter:\ngksudo gedit /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla\n\n*Paste the below, press Ctrl+S to save and Ctrl+Q to exit the editor:\n[Re-enable hibernate by default]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\n\n*Restart, and you should see the Hibernate option as shown below:\n\n4. Removing TuxOnIce\n\n\n*\n\n*If TuxOnIce doesn't work for you, or you simply wish to remove it, start the terminal and enter:\n sudo apt-get remove tuxonice-userui linux-generic-tuxonice linux-headers-generic-tuxonice -y\n\n*and remember to disable the Hibernate option in the menu with:\nsudo rm /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla\n\n*Then restart.\n\nA: This worked for me. In a console run:\nsudo apt-get install uswsusp \n\nThen you can try to suspend your computer with:\nsudo s2ram\n\nor hibernate with\nsudo s2disk\n\nIf that works for you then just reboot and you should be able to hibernate later from the usual button (on the top right on Unity Desktop and selecting Hibernate).\nI made a short tutorial of this and other issues for Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition available here.\n\nA: I had this issue before. If your swap partition is smaller than the amount of memory that you want to store in the hard disk when hibernating you may get this problem.\nYou can either re-size your swap partition, or use a swap file (it's a lot easier if you have no free space to re-size your swap partition). \nHere is how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window (press Ctrl+Alt+T or select Applications > Accessories > Terminal) or log in to remote server using the ssh client. \n\n*Create Storage File\nType the following command to create 512MB swap file (1024 * 512MB = 524288 block size):\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile1 bs=1024 count=524288\n\nSample outputs:\n524288+0 records in\n524288+0 records out\n536870912 bytes (537 MB) copied, 3.23347 s, 166 MB/s\n\n\n\n*\n\n*if=/dev/zero means read from /dev/zero file. /dev/zero is a special file that provides null characters to build a storage file called /swapfile1.\n\n*of=/swapfile1 means write storage file to /swapfile1.\n\n*bs=1024 means read and write 1024 BYTES bytes at a time.\n\n*count=524288 means Copy only 523288 BLOCKS input blocks.\n\n\n*Secure swap file\nSet up correct file permission for security reasons, by entering:\nsudo chmod 0600 /swapfile1\n\nA world-readable swap file is a huge local vulnerability. The above command makes sure only the root user can read and write to the file.\n\n*Set up a Linux swap area\nType the following command to set up a Linux swap area in a file:\nsudo mkswap /swapfile1\n\nSample outputs:\nSetting up swapspace version 1, size = 524284 KiB\nno label, UUID=0e5e7c60-bbba-4089-a76c-2bb29c0f0839\n\n\n*Enable the swap file\nFinally, to activate /swapfile1 swap space immediately, enter:\nsudo swapon /swapfile1\n\n\n*Update /etc/fstab file\nTo activate /swapfile1 after Linux system reboot, add an entry to /etc/fstab file. Open this file using a text editor such as vi:\nsudo vi /etc/fstab\n\nAppend the following line:\n/swapfile1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nSave and close the file. Next time Linux comes up after reboot, it enables the new swap file for you automatically.\n\n*How do I verify swap is activated or not?\nSimply use the free command:\nfree -m\n\nHere is the link from where i got this tutorial: Add a swap file\n\nA: As far as I know this does not work in 12.04.

The Bookmarks backup filename window will close and you can close the Library window. \n\n\nRestoring from backups\nCaution: Restoring bookmarks from a backup will overwrite your current set of bookmarks with the ones in the backup file. \n\n\n*\n\n*At the top of the Firefox window, click the Bookmarks menu and select Show All Bookmarks to open the Library window.\n\n*In the Library window, click the Import and Backup button and then select Restore.\n\n*Select the backup from which you want to restore:\n\n\n*\n\n*The dated entries are automatic backups.\n\n*Choose File... lets you restore from a manual backup (see above). \n\n\n*After choosing a backup, your bookmarks from that file will be restored. Close the Library window. \nMoving bookmarks to another computer\nUsing Firefox Sync\nYou can use Firefox Sync to move your bookmarks from one computer to another.\nNote: Firefox Sync continuously updates itself as you change bookmarks, so it does not provide a true backup service, nor is it intended to be used as one. \nFirefox Sync is the best way to keep your bookmarks (and other profile data) synchronized between all of the computers you use. See What is Firefox Sync? for more information and How to sync Firefox settings between computers for instructions on setting it up.\nUsing a bookmark backup file\nUsing a bookmark backup file\nYou can also use a bookmark backup file from one computer and restore it on another computer. This is useful if you can't Sync the two computers, for some reason.\nThe bookmark backup file can either be a manual backup (see above) or one of the automatic dated backups located inside the Firefox profile folder bookmarkbackups folder. Place the bookmark backup file on your transfer media (e.g. a Flash drive) and copy it to the desktop (or any location) of the other computer. You can then restore the backup from the Firefox Library window, using the Choose File... option, as described in the Restoring from backups section above. \nSource: Derived from this article (\"Back up your bookmarks or move them to another computer\") by AliceWyman, Chris_Ilias, Verdi, scoobidiver, rnewman@mozilla.com, mluna, and greasemonkey.\n\nA: In the Bookmarks tab 'Show all bookmarks' (where you can add/delete/edit bookmarks) there's a tab 'Import and backup'.

I've spent so much time working with stacks before that starting to use the dashboard to get to stuff is counterproductive for me. Is there any tweak that allows stacks (NOT QUICKLISTS) in the launcher?\nPS Dean Howell suggested using the files lens, and frankly it is sort of what I am looking for, but invoking it takes long enough so that it defeats the purpose of using it in the first place. But this gave me an idea. Is it at all possible to \"dock\" a lens on the launcher, so that it would show the dash focused on a certain directory?\n\nA: Check out Drawers: http://launchpad.net/drawers\nIt was written up at: http://www.iloveubuntu.net/drawers-12076-released-persistent-mode-and-configuration-panel\nYou can put just about anything in a drawer by drag and drop. You can even nest drawers inside one another. See below for a screenshot. It's been submitted to the software center but is awaiting review.\nIn the meantime, to install run the following in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ian-berke/ppa-drawers\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install drawers\n\nThen create your first drawer by opening the dash and typing Drawers.\n\n\nA: You cannot add stacks, no. To add them, you'd have to hack the code to support that feature. The closest thing you will get, will be to add your own custom launchers with quicklists, without diving into the code.\nHowever, you can press Super+F (Windows key+F) I think, to go directly to the files lens in the dash. You can hold the Super key down for a few seconds, and it will show a shortcuts overlay, if that isn't the correct shortcut. There are also shortcuts to go directly to the Apps and other lenses.\nBeyond either of those working for what you want to do though, you'll have to start hacking the code.\n", "Q: Brightness is reset to maximum on every restart The brightness of my laptop is reset to max on every restart.

Instead of creating symbolic links that he's mentioned, I've provided the following:\nln -s /etc/init.d/brightness /etc/rc0.d/S25backlight\nln -s /etc/init.d/brightness /etc/rc2.d/S25backlight\nln -s /etc/init.d/brightness /etc/rc6.d/S25backlight\n\nNotice, that instead of rcS.d, I've added a symbolic link to rc2.d, which is a runlevel for \"Graphical multi-user with networking\" (see more). I believe that the reason why the former one doesn't work for me is Ubuntu overriding brightness level after it has been set up by the /etc/init.d/brightness script during S runlevel.\nWith that subtle change, restoring brightness level works like a charm, especially for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on Lenovo ThinkPad L540.\n\nA: Before try workarounds in rc.local, it is worth to try the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*adding simple: quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor to grub looks to be enough on my configuration.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/default/grub  \n\n*replace\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nwith\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\n*sudo update-grub and reboot.\nworked on:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Asus U31SD-XH51 )\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Dell 14z)\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Lenovo g500, remove nomodeset and it will work fine)\n\n\nA: You could try adding a line to /etc/rc.local that will set the desired brightness level. To edit the file, run\nsudo -H gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nand add the following\necho X > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nso that the end result looks like this\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\necho X > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nexit 0\n\nSubstitute X by the desired brightness level.\nIn case /etc/rc.local doesn't exist, as is the case with new Ubuntu releases, you'll need to create it, and make eecutable with the following commands:\nprintf '%s\\n' '#!/bin/bash' 'exit 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/rc.local\nsudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local\n\nPS: Alternatively, there may be /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness instead of the above. Brightness levels vary wildly, and may range from 0 to 10 or to 1000. To find the maximum value, try\ncat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness\nor\ncat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness\n\n\nA: No need to fall into scripting and coding.\nJust follow these simple steps:\nIf screen brightness is stuck at maximum every startup, install xbacklight (sudo apt-get install xbacklight) and add \"xbacklight -set x\" (where 'x' = 0 to 100 desired brightness) to the startup applications via dashboard.

Given that the rules state that the app must be open source, I was wondering if an exemption could be made for a single file containing the OAuth secrets, so that they are not being freely distributed.\nThe risk with a distributed OAuth secret is that they are bound to specific apps so the service can tell which app is requesting what data from which user. If these secrets get into the open, it will allow parties with malicious intent to imitate a request coming from a legitimate app, causing that app to be blamed for any wrong-doing committed using  the compromised credentials.\nI'd be willing to provide the credentials file to the judges in private if they so desire.\nGiven the general requirement for submissions to the software centre to be open source, perhaps such an exemption could be made in the submission policy as well.\n\nA: Depending on which web service you want to use, the answer is one of those:\n1) You can't, period\nIf the service absolutely requires you to completely protect the token secret, then desktop applications are out of luck. Even closed-source applications can have their binaries examined or be memory dumped during HTTP requests. If the web service enforces such a rigid rule, they are either out of touch with reality or expect only web applications to use their API.\n2) Just obfuscate\nSome web services are tolerant if you simply don't make the secret immediately available. Just use a simple reversible obfuscation scheme that does not require closing the source.\n3) Don't protect at all\nYou can see here that Google is an example of service that recognizes that full secret protection is a lost battle for desktop apps.

Probably TrueCrypt cant mount it on Linux at all, but there is still the problem with the wrong size.\nThanks for any suggestions.\n\nA: As a general rule, this symptom is almost always either a driver problem or a hardware problem.\nWhat's happening is that something along the line is taking a 64-bit value and truncating that to 32 bits. This results in a drop of 2 TiB (2048 GiB) in the disk's apparent size, as reported by most disk utilities. Attempts to access beyond the 2 TiB mark are likely to \"wrap around\" to the front of the disk, resulting in incorrect reads or damage when the disk is written. Thus, you should NOT attempt to write to the disk until this problem is solved!\nThis problem is common on external disk enclosures with firmware that uses 32-bit fields to store critical sector information. It's generally necessary to replace such enclosures if you want to use an over-2TiB disk. Since you say that the disk works fine in Windows, though, this is most likely not the problem. One notable exception: If you prepared the disk in Windows as an internal drive and have since transferred it to an external enclosure, you could see the symptoms you report. The solution is to replace the enclosure with one capable of handling over-2TiB disks.\nThe other common cause of this symptom is a driver issue, but the usual problem reports in this case come from Windows users. Linux's USB disk stack has long supported over-2TiB external disks (with proper 64-bit firmware), and the driver stack is identical for most external disks. It could be that there's a bug in the specific kernel you're using, though, so you could try upgrading your kernel (or downgrading it to an earlier version, if you're using the latest version). There are also a handful of model-specific drivers in the kernel, and I don't know how they'd work (or fail to work) with over-2TiB disks.\nIn either case, another possible solution is to change interfaces. If the disk supports both USB and another interface, such as eSATA or FireWire, you could try the other interface. That might bypass whatever bug is causing the problem -- but you'll have to be very careful to never use the buggy interface if you do it this way!\nAs to TrueCrypt, I can't comment on it, since I have no experience with that technology. (Edit: If you've installed some TrueCrypt drivers in Linux, it's conceivable that they're the source of the problem and would have to be removed or upgraded to fix it.)\n", "Q: Is there a way to package man pages with Quickly?

I guess using BCDedit.exe as EasyBCD didn't show me the entries. Anyway, I don't know what parameters to use.\n\n\nI read several articles about it but i didn't find out anything useful.\n\nA: Your partition layout looks odd, but then again this is how manufacturers do their OEM installations.\nIf this is a UEFI system, then reinstalling would be the quickest and straight forward way for getting a working installation. I recommend removing partitions sda5 through sda7, as they seem to be created by you. Then install Ubuntu from ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso  in UEFI mode (when selecting to boot from CD at boot time there should be two options for booting from CD one with UEFI and one without) to ensure that you're installing with UEFI support enabled. A partition layout with a Ubuntu partition and a separate home partition is a good choice. For using suspend to HDD (hibernate) you should choose at least the size of your RAM as the size of the swap partition. There is one additional step to be performed to re-enable hibernate in 12.04. After installation has finished you should have a Ubuntu with the grub-efi-amd64 package installed on your hard drive. The installer should have recognized the correct UEFI system partition (there is a specific GPT partition code for the UEFI system partition), put a grub-efi-stub in there and register it in the UEFI boot variables.\nIn the end you should have at least an entry each for Windows and Ubuntu in your UEFI boot up selection available. If you don't have a Windows related entry there, then this is probably not a UEFI system and you shouldn't attempt to try my suggested solution (you wouldn't be able to boot the CD in UEFI mode). Dual booting should be working via GRUBs chainloading mechanism, so setting Ubuntu via UEFI as the default boot option should work like dual booting worked in the past with GRUB.\n\nA: First, your partition table is clearly a GUID Partition Table (GPT). Since Windows will boot from GPT disks only if the computer uses an Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) rather than the older Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), it's clear that you're booting in EFI mode. This is a critical detail, since traditional BIOS solutions are unlikely to work on an EFI system.\nIt's unclear from your description precisely what's booting. My best guess is that the Windows boot loader is booting, and you've used EasyBCD to create an Ubuntu entry that's not working. This is hardly surprising; the last I checked, the Windows EFI boot loader could not redirect the boot process to another boot loader, so EasyBCD's non-Windows entries will be useless to you. If I've misinterpreted what's happening, and you're actually seeing a GRUB boot menu that's able to boot Windows but not Linux, then please elaborate.\nIf my interpretations so far are correct, you may be able to use your firmware's boot menu to select GRUB rather than Windows and use that to boot into Linux. If your firmware's boot manager is good enough, this may even be an acceptable long-term solution. Unfortunately, EFI firmware implementations' boot managers are extremely variable in quality, and many of them are poor. If you can't find a boot menu in your firmware or if using it is awkward, you have two main options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can reconfigure the computer's boot setup to make GRUB 2 the default boot loader and reconfigure GRUB to include an entry for Windows. This will entail renaming boot loader files and/or using a utility such as Linux's \"efibootmgr\" to adjust the boot loader list in the computer's NVRAM.\n\n*You can add a third-party boot manager, such as rEFIt or its newer fork rEFInd, to control the selection of booting Windows vs. Linux. The rEFInd Web site includes detailed installation instructions. (Note that I'm the one who forked rEFIt into rEFInd.)\n\n\nBe aware that the EFI boot process involves files stored on a partition known as the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is /dev/sda1 on your computer. Boot loader files typically reside in subdirectories of the EFI directory on that partition, as in EFI/Microsoft or EFI/ubuntu. The NVRAM holds a list of boot loaders and the order in which the firmware should try to launch them. Managing boot loaders involves adding, deleting, or moving the boot loader files and editing the NVRAM entries. In some cases, a default boot loader (EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi; although some implementations also support EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi as a default) is loaded if the NVRAM entries are empty or point to invalid boot loaders. For more information on this topic, as well as information on Linux's EFI boot loaders, see my Web page on the topic.\n\nA: Probably the GRUB menu is not properly installed. Try to repair it with the grub-repair CD. Boot with this CD and let repair it automatically your system.\nYou can find more information here.\n\nA: As Windows is using EFI, you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*install grub-efi. This can be performed by ticking the \"Separate /efi\" option of Boot-Repair.\n\n*then setup your BIOS to boot the grub*.efi file in the EFI partition.\n\n\nA: May be you tried to upgrade during installation, that's why it create a extra 1gb space. You can easily use dual boot using ubuntu without installing anything. I am talking about grub2 in ubuntu which is default installed. You just need a live cd configure dual boot. \nThis is very good example of grub2 recovery. \n", "Q: Can I trigger a mouse double click, by holding down the primary button, after a delay?

Normally, Ubuntu is based on Testing; the LTS releases are based on Stable.\n\nThat cannot be true then for 12.04 because Debian Stable (Squeeze) is almost going to be old-stable, and it's obvious that the kernel versions in 12.04, packages, etc. cannot have come from Debian Squeeze.\nSo then what other Debian Stable is there for Precise to be based on?\n\nA: That part of that answer is wrong.\nLTS is based (mostly) on debian-testing\nFrom https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS:\n\n\n*\n\n*We are more conservative in our package merge with Debian, auto-synching with Debian testing, instead of Debian unstable.\n\n*[LTS is not] Cutting Edge: Instead of doing an automatic full package import from Debian unstable, we will do it from Debian testing. The benefit we gain from not introducing new bugs and/or regressions outweighs the new features and/or fixes we often get from unstable.\n\n*\n\n*We reserve the right to selectively pull in updates from unstable, if we believe the stability of the package in Debian is better than what is in the current Ubuntu archive.\n\n\n\n\nThe obvious corollary is that non-LTS releases are based, for the most part, on Debian unstable.\n\nA: This appears to have changed recently per https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS:\n\"Starting with the 14.04 LTS development cycle, automatic full package import is performed from Debian unstable\"\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20131030153921/https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS\n\nA: Ubuntu releases are based first and foremost on the previous Ubuntu release. \nFor a portion of the Ubuntu release cycle, source packages which are not locally modified in Ubuntu are auto-synced from Debian. Normally this auto-sync is from Unstable but for some earlier LTS releases it was from testing instead. It is also possible for packages to be manually synced from Debian either because local modifications in Ubuntu are no longer needed or because there is a desire to sync a newer version from Debian experimental (or unstable in the case of releases where the auto-sync was from testing).\nNowadays package updates (whether from the auto-sync, manual sync or from uploads) initially go into a special section of the archive called \"proposed\", they only get transferred to release when they pass certain checks.\nFurthermore many of the core packages in Ubuntu are locally modified and Ubuntu is often ahead of Debian on versions for such packages. \n\nA: Normally, Ubuntu is based on Unstable. LTS versions are based on Testing, which will eventually become stable. Precise Pangolin is based on Wheezy. Wheezy was Testing at the time Precise was released, but now Wheezy is stable.\n(Note: if I am wrong, I hope someone corrects me, else I mislead people.)\n", "Q: Unable to connect to wireless network on Dell Inspiron 1525 \nPossible Duplicate:\nWireless doesn't work on a Broadcom BCM4312 \n\nI have been using Ubuntu since 9.04 and am upgrading with every new version release.

I'm running servers on the Rackspace Cloud -- the first-generation one, not the next-generation Open Stack one. I believe it's running Xen for the hypervisor.\nI use the stock images from Rackspace. I primarily use 10.04 servers, but I've also been rolling out new servers with 12.04.\nMy problem is that I want to keep the kernel up-to-date. I can apt-get dist-upgrade for new kernels, and the installation works fine. However, when I reboot, the server doesn't come back up.\nMy guess is that there's some custom hackery around the grub configuration that makes the stock kernels work, but upgraded kernels fail.\nHas anyone had a similar problem on the Rackspace Cloud?

I wanted to try creating my own PPA. The project I have is a java project built with maven. This is what I've already done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a PPA.\n\n*Set up a new project on Launchpad.\n\n*Added a branch that is importing my project from a SVN repository.\n\n*Created a recipe for that branch that is publishing the builds to my PPA.\n\n\nThis is where I'm stuck. \nI've read the tutorials and Googled a lot; but, I wasn't able to find out how to build my project. \nI can start a build for the branch; but, as I expected, it fails. I guess I have to put some meta information like a makefile into the repository. Is it even possible to build and package Maven projects on Launchpad? I also tried to build a .deb file locally using bzr dh-make and debuild. bzr dh-make created a lot of files in the ./debian folder but  debuild failed. I guess that it would work if I specified the right meta information in my project so it's the same problem as on Launchpad.\nI know this is a pretty general question but I think there is a lack of proper tutorials for packaging .deb files even if you don't have an \"exotic\" case like me. \nTo sum it up: \nWhat files/information do I have to provide in my project so that it can be properly build and packaged?\nAny help would be great :-)\n\nA: Look in my bookjar project:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/bookjar/source/browse/\nspecifically the debian directory (especially the debian/package.sh file) and the build.xml (ant) file. In that file there is a new target 'upload' that uploads a buildable artefact to the launchpad buildbot.\nI'm using ivy and the netbeans ant infrastructure so it's likely to be slightly different for you. However, one thing is certain: you can't use ivy or maven from the remote buildserver. You need to upload all libraries you use, either in the form of code or jars.\nivy:retrive downloads the files to the current_dir/lib so my project in netbeans is setup to look for it's libraries there (nblibraries.properties is part of the netbeans infrastructure for that). Read the build.xml for details (basically the debian/rules files call a special ant target to build in the server that doesn't try to symlink the jar files - because they are already copied there).\nI'm also taking advantage in my package.sh of my project being in mercurial to build a changelog file from the hg log, so there are other problems to solve if you want the same degree of automatism and don't use hg (in fact, i think that my changelog is bending the rules of debian changelogs by having each change be a 'minor' release).\n", "Q: Couldn't find package ia32-libs \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat happened to the ia32-libs package? \n\nI want to install some Android plugins in Eclipse on my 64bit Ubuntu, but since android is 32bit compatible, I also have to install ia-32-libs.

Other than that, I would like to have a partition for the data, which can be used by both Ubuntu and Windows.\nSo now,\n\n\n*\n\n*I have used the disk utility run from an ubuntu-live cd to format my drive with Master Boot Record (being conscious of the fact that this way I will lose all my data, which I have saved on an external drive before, and that my Ubuntu won't work anymore afterwards), creating partitions for \n\n\n*\n\n*Windows (NTFS), \n\n*personal data (FAT, since as far as I know both Ubuntu and Windows can deal with this),\n\n*a Swap partition for Linux, \n\n*and one partition for Ubuntu (ext4);\n\n\n*trying to install Win XP from cd gives me a blue screen, which stops the setup and telling me to remove all recently installed drives and to run CHKDSK.\nSo I thought, that maybe Windows doesn't like pre-partitioned drives for its installation and thus I need to re-format my hard drive in order to have a completely \"new\" drive, which I can then, during the Windows-installation, partition in order to create the partitions I need. Trying to do this, though, the disk-utility run from the live-CD gives me this warning:\nError creating partition table: helper exited with exit code 1: In part_create_partition_table: device_file=/dev/sda, scheme=0\ngot it\ngot disk\ncommitted to disk\nBLKRRPART ioctl failed for /dev/sda: Device or resource busy\n\nI do not understand why it tells me that the hard-drive is busy, because, as stated above, I am doing all this from a live-CD.\nThus, my questions are:\nHow can I resolve the error given by the disk utility?\nDoes it make sense to use four partitions in the way mentioned above? And if not so, which partitions should I create?\nCan I, theoretically, partition my drive from an Ubuntu live-cd in order to create the partitions I want and to install first Windows and then Ubuntu?\nUpdate:\nWell.. I wasn't aware that I could do that. But anyhow.. I will have to use Matlab (which I know exists also for Ubuntu, but I need to get the Windows version for the internship) to analyze neuroimaging data, which needs a lot of system resources.

Thanks a lot!! Taking a working backup of my ubuntu would have been pretty elegant, I guess! Next time, In case I ever have to do this again, I will certainly consider this solution! So now, I will try to create those two NTFS partitions and follow the steps you mentioned..\nTo be more clear: I was using the disk utility before installing windows, since with my original drive partitioning and formatting, the Windows setup gave me the mentioned blue screen (who knows why... unfortunately, I am not sure anymore how they were partitioned when I tried the Windows installation first, so I can't give any hints..). So I tried to change the formats and drive partitions from the live-cd (since i did not have any os installed at the time) in order to be able to install Windows.\n\nA: Why don't virtualize your Windows, I used a full fledged XP will all office stuff installed on top of VirtualBox, Also it will run flawlessly in a full screen, so it won't make any difference if you have to use it for some days.\n\nA: You need to be more clear. Are you using the disk utility after installing windows or before? \nActually there could have been a more simpler solution to your problem without you requiring to delete ubuntu and then again install it (and all its softwares). See my answer at the end for this. Below is the answer for your current problem.\nSince you have formatted your laptop hdd, simple way would be to install windows first on a clean hdd with 2 simple ntfs partitions (1 small for windows and other for rest), then boot into windows to create more partitions as desired (for swap, ubuntu, commonarea, etc) using windows' own partitioning utility, although still in NTFS format. Finally install ubuntu from live cd, manually stating the partitions (it will automatically format the req. drives to swap and ext4 format). Don't create any partitions from the live cd. Also, ubuntu will automatically install its own boot loader in the MBR, which means ubuntu would be your primary OS.  \n4 partitions would be good enough - windows (NTFS), ubuntu(EXT4), swap(SWAP) and commonarea(NTFS). Also avoid using FAT filesystem. Ubuntu can understand every filesystem which windows can, so NTFS would be better.  \nFind more info here - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot \nP.S.: Next time you wish to do something like this, no need to delete ubuntu os completely. You can actually take an entire working backup of your ubuntu os on an external drive (external drive should be in ext4 format), then completely format and install whatever you want in your laptop hdd and finally copy back the entire ubuntu os to a separate new parition on your hdd. This would save you from installing all the softwares again and doing all the configuration manually.

You can also make or use a different window manager theme with smaller or no title bars.\nTo change the font of the title bars, you can do this, in a terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences titlebar-font \"Font Name 10\"\nJust replace the \"Font Name 10\" with the font name and size you wish to use. To keep the Ubuntu font and make it smaller, you might want to try \"Ubuntu 8\" for example. Also, it's generally a good idea to step font sizes in multiples of 2 (6, 8, 10, 12), as they scale more evenly.\n\nA: You could also set you launcher to auto-hide i did this for my netbook and it made a world of difference. \"system settings\" >  \"appearance\" > then click on the behavior tab.... make your changes from there.\n\nA: Go to terminal and type dconf-editor.

A PCI is just the interface by which any of these components are connecting, so it could be either one of them. Try to intall a program called sensors to find out which one of them is causing the overheating - it will most likely be the CPU.\nsudo apt-get install sensors\n\nThere are other programs that will allow you to scan and monitor the temperature of various components, but you have to figure out which part is causing the overheating - xsensors, computertemp, fancontrol, etc. - you can find them and install them from Ubuntu Software Center.\nSome drivers can make your components run beyond their regular idle speed and cause overheating, but it could also be at the hardware level. Let me know when you find out.\n", "Q: I have deleted python files in usr/bin and cant reinstall it I am a novice at Ubuntu and unfortunately i have deleted 3 files in the usr/bin folder\npython 2.7\npython\npython 2.6\n\nNow my update manager wont work and when i type in python into gnome it says that it is no longer there.\nPlease help me ive tried loads of different things but it just wont work.\nThe closest i got was the following:\nI typed in sudo apt-get -f install\nand i thought i had fixed it but then i got a error message -\nReading package lists...

This should not be too hard to do.  You can probably mount your installed partition using Nautilus, open it, and try copying using the GUI.  If there is an error due to permissions, you may need to use the terminal to copy the files to (I believe) /media/*/usr/bin using \"sudo cp\", where the asterisk will be the name of the partition for your installation.\nAs a novice, you should not be deleting files that require root/admin authority (ie, using sudo or equivalent) without either knowing absolutely that it's OK, or at least copying it to a temporary folder for a while to make sure it's OK.  That is why only certain users are allowed to do that.  \nEdit:  More details\nI booted my live CD (12.04), and I do see python 2.7 in the directory you specified.  I don't think you need the previous version.\nUsing Nautilus, I was able to click on my real installation, and it automounted to /media, as expected.  The files in /media/usr/bin are owned by root, so nautilus can't copy the files, unless it's run as root.\nTo reproduce the files, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your installation is mounted by clicking on it in\nNautilus, where you should then see the symbol for mounted\npartitions, a sort of up-arrow with a line under it.\n\n*Run the bash terminal to get a command line, and enter cd\n/media/*/usr/bin, where the asterisk is the name you see in\nNautilus; you can press tab to autocomplete so you don't need to\ntype in the name.\n\n*Enter the command sudo cp -P /usr/bin/py* ., which will copy the\npython files to the current directory, and preserve the links\n(python links to python2.7).\nThis should replace the deleted files.\nYou might be able to reinstall it using the software center or apt-get if you were to reinstall it rather than install, or uninstall it first.  I think the error may be that it thinks it is installed, so it doesn't copy a new version of the file.  Then, it tries to access the file, and it's not there as expected.\n\nA: Try reinstalling the python packages via apt-get with the --reinstall option:\n$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall python-support python python-minimal python2.7-minimal python2.7 python2.6-minimal python2.6\n\n", "Q: Connecting to multiple networks simultaneously?

Wubi is good if you want to get a hang of Ubuntu safely and without altering your system.\n\n*It's not a trial run, as it is free, and you can use it as long as you want.\n\n*It doesn't creates a new partition. It uses space inside your Windows partition. This space it is easily freed when you uninstall Wubi from the Control Panel in Windows.\n\n*If you really like Ubuntu, I would suggest you to make a new partition of say 30 GB, and then do a full install on it.

To make that change per device name you need to use xinput (as described by Mateo) but the device ID on xinput list might change for number of reasons so to make it work correctly each time you need to dynamically get the correct device ID on startup.\nFor example:\n# find your device ID on the list\nxinput list\n\n# check the current buttons map:\nxinput get-button-map $your_device_id\n\n# find the problematic buttons\n# press ctrl+c when done\nxinput --test $your_device_id\n\nMy device name is Logitech MX Vertical Ergonomic Mouse and I need to switch places on buttons 4 and 5 in a following button map:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nSo to get the device ID reliably I use:\nxinput list | grep \"Vert.*Mouse\" | cut -f2 | cut -c4-\n\n\n*\n\n*xinput list - spits out device names and IDs\n\n*grep \"Vert.*Mouse\" - finds the line containing Vert and Mouse\n\n*cut -f2 - cuts second \"field\" from that line, i.e. id=17\n\n*cut -c4- - cuts from the 4th \"character\", i.e. 17\nNow that I have the command that always spits out the correct device ID, I can put it in parentheses like so: $(command) - it runs the command in a subshell and replaces it with its output. So a full one-liner that can be placed in a starting script looks as mentioned in TL;DR.\n\nA: Execute this code in command prompt, it will remove and reset Optical mouse and touchpad to default- left click is for clicking and right click is for options.\nmodprobe -r psmouse\nmodprobe psmouse proto=imps\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu ~12.04 and prior\n#!/usr/local/bin/tcsh -fb\n\n# switches between right and left mouse\nset leftMouseHand = `gconftool-2 --get /desktop/gnome/peripherals/mouse/left_handed`\nif ( \"$leftMouseHand\" == \"false\" ) then\n    gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/peripherals/mouse/left_handed true --type boolean\n    gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/peripherals/mouse/cursor_theme Oxygen_White_Big --type string\nelse\n    gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/peripherals/mouse/left_handed false --type boolean\n    gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/peripherals/mouse/cursor_theme Oxygen_White_Big --type string\nendif\n\n", "Q: How to install a download .tar.bz linux kernel?

I installed LXDE, not Lubuntu, but it would start LXDM, the login manager for LXDE.  I looked all over and tried many things to get this to stop loading LXDE.  After looking at this question and answer, I found a good way of stopping it for LXDE.  \nInstead of adding a file similar to lightdm.override, I was looking in /etc/init and found a file called lxdm.conf.  After looking through the file, mainly because I was curious, I found that this is the file that I needed, or didn't need.  After closing the file, I renamed it \n    sudo mv /etc/init/lxdm.conf /etc/init/lxdm.conf.bak\n\nI renamed it instead of removing it in case it caused problems, but so far I can't tell any problems from renaming this file, so it should be safe to remove.\nI don't know about other DE's but this worked for me with LXDE.\n\nA: In recent versions of Ubuntu, gdm has been replaced with lightdm - this is why you don't have a gdm.conf. To set lightdm to be started manually, create an 'override' file for its init configuration:\necho 'manual' | sudo dd of=/etc/init/lightdm.override\n\n(this just creates a file, called /etc/init/lightdm.override, containing a single line that says manual)\nThis way, lightdm will only be started when you invoke:\nsudo service lightdm start\n\nand to stop it:\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\n\nA: Check systemctl get-default.\nIf the output is graphical.target, then set it to multi-user.target with systemctl set-default:\nsystemctl set-default multi-user.target\n\nReference this link for more on systemd-targets: 10.3. Working with systemd Targets\n\nA: The following is for Ubuntu Server 12 LTS \nFirst you need open a real term with CTRL+ALT F1\nlogin\nStop gdm with:\n$ sudo service gdm stop\n\nRemove gdm you don't need it at all on a server.\n$ sudo apt-get remove gdm \n\nSet next boot runlevel with.\n$ sudo telinit 3\n\nWithout gdm you will need to install xinit if you want to still be able to run gui based apps without the gdm window manager.\n$ sudo apt-get install xinit\n\nReboot to runlevel 3.\n$ sudo reboot\n\nTo run a GUI or desktop after reboot do. \n$ startx \n\nThis will start your gnome session as normal.\nWhen finished simply logout of your desktop to and drop you back to a level 3 term.  \nAlso you can now start individual apps without a desktop too like:\n$ startx nautilus\n\nor privileged with  \n$ startx sudo synaptic\n\n", "Q: Exclude bad ram bytes I have 5 bytes (or bits, don't know) of bad Ram.

Does su sachin inherits some permissions from the root user at this step?\nAny explanations would be much appreciated.\n\nA: What are the permission of /home?  You need +x permissions there as well.\nAlso, you need to use su - sachin to get to full environment of the new user.\nNote that the man page for useradd now says:\n\n   useradd is a low level utility for adding users. On Debian,\n   administrators should usually use adduser(8) instead.\n\n\nIf you're using a desktop/GUI version, things usually work out more easily with the users-admin tool.\nThe user with the active shell won't inherit the new group in this session (assuming you're doing it as in the example, or by script) -- you need to have a new shell for that user to test the group membership.  (Unless you are root.)  This is a longstanding Unix behavior -- so you would typically start a new shell process for the user, e.g., by opening a new terminal (which spawns a new shell, reading your environment by default), or by spawning a new shell for the user in the same terminal.   \n\nA: Logout and then login back, it will work or you can use a new terminal (not gnome-terminal, the tty-devices).\nIt seems to be a bug as the requirement of this logout and login is completely unnecessary.\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu 10.04 to replace 12.04? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to roll back Ubuntu to a previous version? \n\nI Would like to wipe hard drive clean and start over.

I thought this question might get a better response in AskUbuntu, as it seems to have more to do with Ubuntu than Windows at a glance. \nLet's say I have a foo.mkv file.

What makes Ubuntu recognize files \"out of the box\" unlike Windows 7?\n\nA: I think Ubuntu uses the file header to identify file type and generate the thumbnail on that basis , but in windows a file containing meta data named Thumbnail.db would be updated when windows explorer scan file types (based on the file extension). \nThis document supports my answer .\nhttp://specifications.freedesktop.org/thumbnail-spec/thumbnail-spec-latest.html#CREATION\nUbuntu uses Nautilus that complies with Freedesktop implementation, that uses file MIMEtype .

After googling I found that I had to enter:\nsudo apt-get remove appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-gtk appmenu-qt\n\nIf I do that I get the error message:\n\nE: Unable to locate package appmenu-gtk3\n\nCan anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong here and explain how to fix this problem?\n\nA: It already means that you don't have the appmenu-gtk3 package installed in your computer.\nIf you are not convinced, try removing something that you obviously know doesn't exist.\nFor example,\nsudo apt-get remove kinglear \n\nwould give the following error message:\n\nE: Unable to locate package kinglear\n\n\nA: To remove the menu bar, Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo apt-get autoremove appmenu-gtk appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-qt\n\nAlso you could try removing it by using Synaptic Package Manager.  If you need to install it \n \n\nA: Yes, if it says there is no package as appmenu-gtk3, it is indeed the case. But you can disable global menu by following below procedure:\nGo to /etc/X11/Xsession.d/ and open the files 80appmenu-gtk3 and 80-appmenu with administrative power.\ncommand in terminal: sudo gedit /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80appmenu-gtk3 and comment out all the lines by putting a # mark before each line.\ndo this also for 80appmenu, by opening with sudo gedit /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80appmenu. \nLogout and login again.\n", "Q: gpg passcode error I just created my gpg key using developer.ubuntu.com packaging page's documentation and also upload the public key in key server.

We see Most of the Windows softwares are packaged in a single executable file. When I double-click Setup file, it sets up all the files, binaries and libraries with it. \nI understand the dependency of Ubuntu or more generally linux packages. But I wonder, Why these exists. Isn't it possible to build a single file with all dependencies? What is the problems with this method?\nPlease try to give the reason in details.\n\nA: That is not totally true. Ubuntu software usually comes in one single .deb file. Being utterly simplistic (and inaccurate), .deb files are the correspondent .exe file for windows. All programs, including those in windows use dependencies to other files in the operative system (libraries). The installation process is just more or less explicit in different OS. When you use the software center in Ubuntu to download a program you download only the dependencies that are not installed in your system and the actual program files. That prevents the system from being overloaded with duplicate files and duplicate functionality that would end up in conflicts.\nBelieve it or not, the only difference between installing a program in windows or Ubuntu is the amount of information that they provide to the users. Windows thinks that its users are dumb and do not want them to know what it is being installed when running an exe file. In linux you get that information..for some users is too much detail, but others (most) really appreciate that.\nhope it makes sense.\n\nA: On Ubuntu, most software does come in a single file.  It is a *.deb debian package file which is downloaded, unpacked and installed from your package-manager.\nWhy doesn't Ubuntu install software from self-extracting executables like most Windows software does?\nBecause self extracting *.exe files are a very dangerous proposition to accept.\nThe most critical differences between a self-extracting executables and a packaging system, like the debian/Ubuntu one, are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security\n\n*Transparency\n\n*More granular control\n\n\nIn more detail:\nSecurity\nIn the windows world you have to trust that single *.exe file.  How can one really be sure it can be trusted?  How can you even know that it installs something? How can you be sure it doesn't do other things behind your back?\nIn Ubuntu, all packages are digitally signed, so by using a separate package file - the package manager (be it muon, synaptic, aptitude, or even straight apt) - you get the content verified before it is even unpacked, let alone installed.  This assumes, of course, that you trust the repositories.  I'd rather trust the Ubuntu repositories (a single authority) than hundreds of often unfamiliar different sources to download from.\nGranular Control\nWith a *.exe file, you can essentially do one thing: execute it.  In Ubuntu you can inspect the contents of the package, descriptions, configs, individual files, latest changes, bug fixes, etc. from the convenience of your package manager, before deciding whether to install or not.\nWhen you install from an *.exe file, you also have to trust its 'uninstall' hook (and not all *.exe files are guaranteed to have one).  In Ubuntu, all files belonging to standard packages installed by the package manager, can always be uninstalled because that's a function of the package manager, not the package itself.  The package manager is a separate, and trusted application, which provides both the installer and uninstaller, the package cannot take away the uninstall hook from you.  Of course, a malicious package can sneak stuff via post-install actions, but that's why we have the official repository system and the same people we trust to maintain them.\nTransparency\nIt goes further. On Ubuntu I can really trust my system, because I can verify the software on many levels.  The ultimate level is being able to look at source-code. binary packages have corresponding source packages.  I can actually look at the source (Example: 'apt-get source bash' will give you the full sources to the bash shell).  In the world of *.exe files, usually there are only binaries, and who knows what they actually do behind the scenes?\nThat said, there are always exceptions to the rules, but for me security and trust mean I cannot accept executing binaries from hundreds of different sources that are hard to verify as a standard way to install components on my system.\n\nA: In addition to what has been said by others, sometimes a single piece of software is split up into several packages because not all features are relevant to all users. For example, if the documentation of a program is voluminous, it usually will be provided by a separate package. This allows users which are not interested in these optional features to save disk space and bandwidth/time for downloading.\n\nA: The main reason that dependencies are not included with the program itself is so that components of the system can be easily updated.\nImagine one dependency is used by five different programs. If a security vulnerability is found in that dependency, only one copy has to be updated, rather than five copies.\nTo the user, it doesn't matter that multiple packages need to be installed - installing the one piece of software you want automatically installs its dependencies.\n\nThe main difference between .deb and .exe packaging is not that Ubuntu software is not published in a single file. The main difference is the whole concept of a software repository that contains packages, and that updates can be easily be provided from.\nThis can sometimes be problematic for computers without a direct internet connection. There are tools, like APTonCD, that help minimise these difficulties.\n\nA: Let's try sharing my understanding about the dependencies (Yes, I was aware of the merit of Ubuntu or more generally Linux way of handling software. I simply was trying to assemble all good opinion and reason in a central way, so that I can demonstrate some of my friends).\nWindows Softwares are mostly packaged in a single file. Does this imply they don't have any dependency?\nNo, Almost all softwares have dependency on some other pieces of softwares. (Unless that software is very low-level and can talk with the hardware directly, such as Operating System itself). Microsofts's softwares aren't free from dependency. So,The important question is: how they handle this?\nAnswer: They handle this in their own traditional way. Assuming their most users as dumb, they simply put all the dependency in the single file, resulting the bigger sized (1 filed) Software.\nFor an example, See the Games released for Microsoft. Almost every game includes DirectX setups, though users may have updated versions of them already.\nHere is something i have found on Google about Why DirectX is included with every game.\n\nEven if a later version of the binary is already installed, that version cannot be used, and even if your DirectX install is up-to-date because you've run a more recent version of the installer that is not guaranteed to have installed all previous versions. Even worse, if a version is installed for x86 it doesn't guarantee the same version is installed for x64, so 64 bit and 32 bit games may need to run the same exact installer version but targeting different platforms when run.\n\nclick here for full article. It is clear they are not doing very good with handling dependency.\nMost of the time, regardless of dependencies already are in place, they provide it to gain simplicity (for their users). Also see how many softwares themeselves include the .NET runtime components.\nAnother example from my experience: Once I downloaded and installed an MS software. Being satisfied with the process, I clicked on the icon to open the software, Only then it tells me that \"I need Java to run\". Such a situation never occur in a Linux world via it's package management. (unless you try downloading .deb files from repository site and installing by double clicking, in a MS fashion).\nHow Linux handles this problem of dependency?\nWell, Linux or Ubuntu does not hide the fact that, you have to have dependencies installed for using the software (unlike the Microsoft way). But when you installed the components, Another software which dependes on the same component use the installed depencies previously installed (unlike MS softwares including all things).\n", "Q: Unable to run Ubuntu Software Center in 12.04 This is what I get after typing software-center in terminal\n2012-06-16 22:54:17,610 - softwarecenter.ui.gtk3.app - INFO - setting up proxy 'None'\n2012-06-16 22:54:17,617 - softwarecenter.db.database - INFO - open() database: path=None use_axi=True use_agent=True\n2012-06-16 22:54:18,142 - softwarecenter.backend.reviews - WARNING - Could not get usefulness from server, no username in config file\n2012-06-16 22:54:18,697 - softwarecenter.db.pkginfo_impl.aptcache - INFO - aptcache.open()\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/pkginfo_impl/aptcache.py\", line 243, in open\n    self._cache = apt.Cache(GtkMainIterationProgress())\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/cache.py\", line 102, in __init__\n    self.open(progress)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/cache.py\", line 149, in open\n    self._list.read_main_list()\nSystemError: E:Typ „ain“ je neznámy na riadku 2 v zozname zdrojov /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-precise.list\n2012-06-16 22:54:21,916 - softwarecenter.db.enquire - ERROR - _get_estimate_nr_apps_and_nr_pkgs failed\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/enquire.py\", line 115, in _get_estimate_nr_apps_and_nr_pkgs\n    tmp_matches = enquire.get_mset(0, len(self.db), None, xfilter)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/appfilter.py\", line 89, in __call__\n    if (not pkgname in self.cache and\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/pkginfo_impl/aptcache.py\", line 263, in __contains__\n    return self._cache.__contains__(k)\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__contains__'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/software-center\", line 176, in <module>\n    app.run(args)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/app.py\", line 1358, in run\n    self.show_available_packages(args)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/app.py\", line 1288, in show_available_packages\n    self.view_manager.set_active_view(ViewPages.AVAILABLE)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/session/viewmanager.py\", line 149, in set_active_view\n    view_widget.init_view()\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/panes/availablepane.py\", line 168, in init_view\n    self.apps_filter)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/views/catview_gtk.py\", line 240, in __init__\n    self.build(desktopdir)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/views/catview_gtk.py\", line 491, in build\n    self._build_homepage_view()\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/views/catview_gtk.py\", line 266, in _build_homepage_view\n    self._append_whats_new()\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/views/catview_gtk.py\", line 430, in _append_whats_new\n    whats_new_cat = self._update_whats_new_content()\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/views/catview_gtk.py\", line 419, in _update_whats_new_content\n    docs = whats_new_cat.get_documents(self.db)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/categories.py\", line 124, in get_documents\n    nonblocking_load=False)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/enquire.py\", line 317, in set_query\n    self._blocking_perform_search()\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/enquire.py\", line 212, in _blocking_perform_search\n    matches = enquire.get_mset(0, self.limit, None, xfilter)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/appfilter.py\", line 89, in __call__\n    if (not pkgname in self.cache and\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/db/pkginfo_impl/aptcache.py\", line 263, in __contains__\n    return self._cache.__contains__(k)\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__contains__'\n\n\nA: You have an error with one PPA.\nTyping \nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu* && sudo apt-get update\n\nshould fix it.\n", "Q: Ctrl+Alt+T doesn't open Terminal (Compiz related?)

Apple devices with Unix cores have amazing battery times, but they also design their own hardware.

For example, powering down some devices may require special knowledge of the underlying physical components.\nPower saving is a non-trivial issue, and sometimes bugs in the firmware (BIOS) can lead to sub-optimal configurations, or maybe drivers are based on binary blobs which we have little or no control over.\nAs for on-going work, there is a project page where bugs can be filed against mis-behaving applications that allow us to focus on fixing power sucking issues:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-power-consumption\nI also have some blog articles on this work: \nhttp://smackerelofopinion.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/power\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Wireless broken after latest 12.04 update I updated 12.04 yesterday and it broke my wireless connection.\niwconfig\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\nl@ubuntu:~$ lspci|grep Network\n03:00.0 Network controller: Ralink corp.

My comparison with the Intel Atom netbook 32-bit consuming resource only up to 190mb with Unity 3D. any solution for that?\n\n\nA: Your netbook with \"Intel Atom\" is 32bit and your \"Acer Aspire AO 722 with AMD C-60 processor\" is a 64bit processor, running Ubuntu 12.04 64bit. So, the simple answer is Yes, It is normal to use more resource for a 64 bit OS, than a 32bit OS.\nAs for comparison, I run Ubuntu 12.04 32bit with Unity 3D. It consumes around 350~ MB of RAM.\nMy Suggestion:\nThough, You did not mention how much RAM you have, I will suggest to use 64bit Ubuntu with Unity 3D, If you have have >= 2GB and You are not a power user with graphics intensive work. But If you do lots of graphics intensive work, and have RAM less than 2GB, I recommend to use either Unity 2D or Xubuntu or Lubuntu.  \nFor a detailed discussion about 32bit and 64bit, you can check this question\nYou can also read this page for a neat discussion about 32 bit and 64 bit system\n\nA: When I run Unity 3D, it does not comsume as much resources that you are reporting. Do you know how to locate your system log files? Check and see if there are any errors.\nAlso, Compiz is stable, but not too stable. Memory leaks happen every once in a while, so try rebooting and see if you get the same amount of resources being used.\nAnd finally, if you can stand not having eye candy and visual effects, you can just run Unity 2D instead. To do this, click the button to the top right of your login name box when you are at the Login screen, and then choose Ubuntu 2D.\n\nA: Full fledged Ubuntu with Unity 3D will certainly eat more RAM, though I don't really know exactly how much is normal. I'm running 32-bit Lubuntu 12.04 on an Acer Aspire D257 and it uses 90 Mb of RAM without other processes going.\nI think, most of the modern OSes are made for computers that have 2 GB of RAM or more, in my experience. \nIf you don't have that much RAM, I suggest you try Lubuntu, which is very lightweight. Or if you plan to buy RAM soon, you can use Unity 2D until then (which is usually more lightweight than full 3D Unity).\nSince you already have Ubuntu installed, you can run it like a Lubuntu system by installing the lubuntu-desktop package. Then log out (or reboot, but that's not necessary), click the Ubuntu logo icon on the login screen, select Lubuntu from the drop-down menu, and log in.\n", "Q: How do I make a Live USB without destroying my Windows computer?

The advantage is that if something isn't working, there is one less thing to get in the way. \nHowever, if you really need an older version of PHP, you might find it to be too much trouble to get all the versions to work together; I don't know if the current versions of MySQL and Apache work with the old PHP version.\nYou could try something like this: Bitnami Lampstack, but I don't think it supports 64-bit.\nAnother option is Oldapps xampp.  Oldapps.com would be good if you wanted to go the separate route also, as they have old versions of all the individual components.\n", "Q: Java wont run in firefox?

How should I add python twisted as a dependency so that it will be installed when a user installs my application?\n\nA: The good thing is that Quickly will handle this for you, so you don't have to worry about it at all :)\nOnce you've added the import statement to add Twisted in your code, the next time you run the quickly package (or share or release or submitubuntu), Quickly will automatically detect that you're using it and will add it to the dependencies in the debian/control file in your source tree.\nThis will take care of your package pulling in python-twisted as a dependency whenever it is installed.\nIn addition to that, if you really need additional dependencies that you don't use directly in the code, you can use the quickly configure dependencies command and add a comma-separated list of extra dependencies to the text editor that's then fired up. Quickly will then always add those dependencies to the package. Be sure to know what you're doing if you're using that command.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu 11.04's system settings in Ubuntu 12.04?

Or is there any Third-Party System Settings that has the same functionality or look?\n\nA: You can't do it without hacking\nBecause system settings in the 11.04 is the system settings for the GNOME 2, and system settings in the 12.04 is system settings for the GNOME 3.

As the title suggests, I am asking a lot.\nWe've been trying to generate some screencasts on my eeepc. recordmydesktop is doing the job  decently, but only if allowed time to \"compile\" the video afterwards. If we ask it to do \"on the fly\", video and audio get out of sync.\nNow, we are creating many screencasts as practice (and like to watch them after, to criticize). Reducing quality is undesirable, because eventually a good practice run becomes the one we'll release.\nSo we'd like a way to do screencasts \"on the fly\", with decent quality, on the low end machine. As nothing is ever free, we are willing to sacrifice: we don't care too much about compression: 20GB for a 15min video is acceptable\n\nA: I've found a satisfatory way:\nIt seems that mkv(**) allows for many levels of compression. By using a low compression for video, I am able to record in real time and with quality on my lowly eeepc.\nTo achieve that, I had to use ffmpeg.

Im wanting to know how to install ubuntu 12.04's OpenGL aux libraries if any. Im trying to program OpenGL with C++. I cant find anything on google so. \nany help would be super great!!! \n\nA: Firstly, why aren't you using GLUT? The OpenGL FAQ hates AUX:\n\n2.130 What is the AUX library?\nVery important: Don't use AUX. Use GLUT instead.\nThe AUX library was developed by SGI early in OpenGL's life to ease creation of small OpenGL demonstration programs. It's currently neither supported nor maintained. Developing OpenGL programs using AUX is strongly discouraged. Use the GLUT instead. It's more flexible and powerful and is available on a wide range of platforms.\n\nLong-unsupported software has a habit of not being packaged or (if it has already), being removed.\nFrom what I'm starting to gather from reading around, GLAUX was never supported on Linux and is long-since dead on Windows.\nFollow the advice of the FAQ and use GLUT (libglui et al).\n", "Q: How can you completely remove a package?

For advice specific to your situation, you'll have to edit your question to include additional information--in particular, the complete and exact text of the error message you are getting.\nRemoving packages with sudo apt purge ... or sudo apt --purge remove ... will remove them and all their global (i.e., systemwide) configuration files. This is usually what people mean when they talk about completely removing a package.\nBut that doesn't mean your system is the same as it was before the package was installed. In particular:\n\n\n*\n\n*This does not remove packages that were installed as dependencies, when you installed the package you're now removing. Assuming those packages aren't dependencies of any other packages, and that you haven't marked them as manually installed, you can remove the dependencies with sudo apt autoremove or (if you want to delete their systemwide configuration files too) sudo apt --purge autoremove.\n\n*This does not remove non-systemwide configuration files. Specifically, it does not remove user-specific configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*It does not remove the configuration files and directories located in users' home directories (or in the .config subdirectory of their home directories), created by the software the package provides.\n\n\n*\n\n*If these files/folders are not stored in .config, they usually start with a . themselves. Either way, you can see them with ls by using the -a or -A flag, and you can see them in Nautilus and most other file browsers/managers by pressing Ctrl+H or going to View > Show Hidden Files.\n\n\n*It does not reverse changes made to existing user-specific configuration files.\n\n*It does not remove new gconf or dconf keys, or reverse any gconf or dconf configuration changes.\n\n\n*Using purge or --purge remove instead of remove does not reverse changes to existing systemwide configuration files provided by other packages or created manually by the user. However, sometimes such changes are undone by uninstalling the package (whether or not it's a purge rather than a remove).\n\nA: Instead of removing auto-installed dependent packages manually, use the following instead:\n\n zanfilip@zanfilip-VPCEB3L0E:~/jp/eclipse$ sudo apt-get --purge autoremove\n    Reading package lists...

[Y/n] \n\n\n\nA: If you want to remove some secific packages you can use these commands:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep PACKAGE_NAME | awk '{ print $1}'| xargs apt-get -y --purge autoremove\n\ndon't forget the \"-y\" switch because otherwise apt-get would keep asking about removing the individual packages and won't remove anything.\n\nA: Use the command:\nsudo apt-get purge --auto-remove packagename\n\nIt will purge required packages along with dependencies that are installed with those packages. The --auto-remove option works similar to sudo apt-get autoremove.\n\nA: Another option you have, is using the debfoster package. This will interactively find and suggest packages for removal (and purge) along with dependant packages.\nsudo apt install debfoster\nsudo debfoster\n# and optionally remove debfoster too\nsudo purge debfoster\n\n\nA: If you're using snap you can remove a package using:\n$ sudo snap remove <package>\n\nApplication code, its run time dependencies and associated user data are all cleaned up. If your snap declared a service, they will as well be shut down and removed.\n\nA: Before uninstalling the software package, you must first find the exact package name.

There's a check to see if the files on the archive server have a more recent date and time than what is already on your computer. If they have changed, they will get downloaded sooner or later anyway.\nExcept for those individuals running development releases, the repositories that change a lot are pretty small (updates containing Stable Release Updates, and security fixes are the two repos that come to mind).\nDevelopment releases are special because the main repository, containing each main package, is being changed several times a day. The main repositories are frozen just before release.\n\nYou needn't upgrade everything, however--you can select just to upgrade just the packages you want.\n\nA: Yes, You need to do sudo apt-get update after adding a PPA. But if you are concerned with the download data or only want to update the index file from the PPA, then You can do a trick to prevent that.\nI do this trick to avoid unnecessary update of the package list, see this question about the matter.  \nA workaround to update only the interested Index file:\nMost of the time, we update package list to add a PPA. so this is a workaround for that \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file as /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99mysettings and\nput this line in the file. Apt::Get::List-Cleanup 'false';. \nHow ? : Type these  in a terminal  \nsudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99mysettings    \n\nExplanation: It causes apt-get not to delete the index files which are already downloaded. \n\n*Disable the repositories which you do not like to update now. You can go here  to see how you can disable repositories .  \nSee the below images to do that after opening software-properties-gtk.\n\n\n\n\n*Then run apt-get update command in a terminal. wait till it ends.\n\n*Finally again enable all repositories  which you have disabled a few minutes ago.

What I'm trying to achieve is to get cold-start, zero-state DHCP lease which means forcing dhclient through the full discovery and configuration process (DHCPDISCOVER–DHCPOFFER–DHCPREQUEST–DHCPACK as opposed to the shortcutted DHCPREQUEST–DHCPACK cycle which uses a remembered address). I need this to debug a network configuration problem.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*flushing current lease with dhclient -r, disconnecting the current Network Manager connection;\n\n*killing any leftover dhclient and dnsmasq processes;\n\n*cleaning /var/lib/dhcp/ directory, which supposedly contains the client lease database;\n\n*sudo restart network-manager.\n\n\nBut even after these steps I see in the logs DHCPDISCOVER immediately followed by DHCPREQUEST of somehow still remembered address.\nClearly, the OS is storing the address somehow else, and I've run out of ideas. Any help from the community?\n\nA: DHCP Client program writes the lease to a file. Just delete the file and restart networkmanager.\n/var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases\nThis is where the leases are stored, in my computer.\n\nA: This did the trick for me(for eth0, run from sudo su):\ndhclient -r -v eth0 && rm /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.* ; dhclient -v eth0\n\n\nA: What you are seeing is not your machine remembering the IP. In syslog you see DISCOVER REQUEST OFFER ACK however this is not in the order that it happened.\nIt actually went DISCOVER OFFER REQUEST ACK to confirm this you can sniff the traffic between the PC and upstream DHCP server. You sent DISCOVER the server sent back OFFER and you got the IP from the OFFER for your REQUEST\nYou did everything right however, when you did \"dhclient -r\" dhclient will send a unicast RELEASE and some ISPs only accept multicast packets to their DHCP server, so the RELEASE never got there, as far as the server is concerned your lease is still valid, so it gave you back the same IP in the OFFER.\n\nA: Normally, dhclient -r should do the trick; but if that doesn't work for you, I found a solution here:\n+ Renew an IP address one time :\nNote: In this example we will be using the interface eth0. The interface must be configured for DHCP as up and running.\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and do sudo su to root.\n\n*Type ifconfig to show the current IP address that you received from DHCP.\n\n*Type dhcpcd -k to send the appropriate signals to dhcpcd (you might need to install dhcpcd by doing apt-get install dhcpcd).\n\n*Now bring the interface back up by typing ifup eth0.\n\n*Type ifconfig to show the new IP address.\n\nThere is also a section about renewing the IP address every-time, but the description was for RPM-based distros (in contrast to Debian-based distros like Ubuntu).\nHope it helps :)\n", "Q: What does the term \"Extended Partition\" mean? Is it safe to use this type of partition? In the image below, what does Extended 103 GB mean?\n\n\n\n\nA: A traditional partition table like yours can have maximum of four primary partition.\nThat means you can't have more than four drive. Concept of extended partition solves this problem.\nAn extended partition is a special type of partition that can hold multiple logical partitions. It's is like a container/wrapper of all logical partitions. Inside an extended partition you can create many logical partitions (this solves the maximum number of drives limitation). \nPrimary partitions are generally used for installation of operating systems. However, logical partitions can also be used (for eg. your Ubuntu is installed on an extended partition)\nIn your hard disk you have three primary partitions :\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows (385GB)\n\n*Extended partition (where Ubuntu is installed)\n\n*Recovery partition.\n\n\nIn a word, your partition table is 100% alright. :)\n\nA: Yes, using an Extended Partition is safe. It is a work-around used to extend the original method of partitioning a disk which only allowed dividing a disk into a maximum of four partitions. This description in Wikipedia provides a (very) brief overview of the terms and their meanings.\nThe original method was developed in the early 1980's when 10-20 MiB was considered a \"very large\" disk. To put it another way, the original Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme was created at a time when 0.002% of your 500 GB drive was considered a HUGE! amount of storage. \nBy the time they realized how foolish the original scheme was, they were locked into into it. So using an Extended Patition containing logical partitions was developed as a work-around.\nAt some point in the future, disks will no longer use MBR partitioning. Instead they will use a GUID Partition Table (GPT). Using GPT partitioning there can be (at least) 128 primary partitions. So GPT partitioning does not use an Extended Partition. (As a side note, a minimum of 16 MiB ... or over 1 1/2 times the size of one of those early 10 MiB hard drives used with a 1980's PC ... is reserved just for a GUID Patition Table.)\nHowever, all the major computer manufacturers appear to be working together to make the transition from MBR to GPT partitioning as difficult as possible. So it is not clear at what point MBR partitioning will be replaced by GPT partitioning. The use of an Extended Partition may be with us for quite some time yet.\n", "Q: How big is the mono runtime? How big is the mono runtime, and how does it compare in size to other popular runtimes like python, ruby and java?\n\nA: Taking debian SID and installing the minium required to run a hello world program gives:\nRUBY - 13.1 MB\nOPENJDK - 137 MB\nPYTHON - 17.7 MB\nMONO - 11.5 MB\nQT - 28.8 MB\nThis makes Mono the smallest of all languages investigated.\nThis is taken from blog post by the mono packager directhex.\nhttp://apebox.org/wordpress/rants/416/\n", "Q: Dual boot 10.04 and 12.04 I'm currently running 12.04, my 160GB hard disk is messed up, I'm going to completely format it.\nHere is what I want to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep 10 GB for 10.04 /\n\n*Keep 10 GB for 12.04 /\n\n*Keep 4 GB for /swap\n\n*rest for /home.  \n\n\nHow should I start, install 10.04 first then 12.04?, Am I missing anything?\nAlso I read I can share my home folder between the two OS when its on another partition, will it be done by default or do I need to take some steps to do this?\n\nA: First thing is to make sure that you have both installation medias, and that your system is set to boot from CD.  If you don't download 12.04LTS  and 10.04\nAs far as installation goes, I would recommend that you install 10.04 first, just so 10.04's older grub version won't replace 12.04's newer version.\nAs far as sharing goes, read below:\n\nThe only two partitions that it is really safe to share are /home and\n  swap. Swap data is temporary anyway and not expected to survive\n  between reboots, so a common swap partition makes a lot of sense.\n  Running a separate home partition is a good idea, because your data\n  survives reinstallation, but it can be a little tricky to share /home\n  between two distros. Because of differences in program versions, and\n  possible conflicts of user IDs, it's not a good idea to share a home\n  directory between two distros, so you're better off using one home\n  partition but a different home directory on that partition for each\n  distro.\nYou can either use a different username with each distro, or use the\n  same name but a different directory. The convention of using\n  /home/username as the home directory is just that, and is only a\n  default setting, not a requirement. If your username is bryan, you\n  could have home directories of /home/bryan-ubuntu, /home/bryan-studio\n  and so on. Each distro installation is a separate entity: you cannot\n  share installed program and library files between two. Some distros\n  modify programs to suit their own needs, and it is very rare for them\n  to update versions at exactly the same time.\nYou could share /boot in theory, but it can be a lot of work to set up\n  and maintain, and a separate /boot partition is not really necessary\n  with modern hardware. Using the number of partitions per distro that\n  you are using is sure to exceed the partition limits of the system\n  before long. You have a couple of options here. The simplest is to\n  have a single root partition for each distro, plus common swap and\n  home partitions. Each distro is then a self-contained entity within\n  its own partition. A more flexible option, especially if you want to\n  run multiple distros, is to use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM). This\n  would entail having a small /boot partition for each distro plus a\n  large partition given over to LVM. This would then contain logical\n  'partitions' for the various distros, as well as /home and swap.\nThe advantage of this approach is flexibility, volumes can be created,\n  resized and removed on the fly, which is useful when experimenting.\n  Many distros have an option to use LVM during installation. There is\n  another option when experimenting with different distros:\n  virtualisation. You can install VirtualBox on Ubuntu and create\n  virtual machines within that for any distros you would like to\n  experiment with. Only when one convinces you that you want to use it\n  long term do you need to worry about partitioning the disk to install\n  it.\n\nSource: http://www.tuxradar.com/answers/589\n\nA: It is a good idea to first install the old version and after the new version of the OS. You can have a common home partition, but as Mitch said, there can be some conflicts due to changes in the OS. Maybe it is better to keep the home folder in the boot partition and make a store partition to keep your common data.\nThe swap partition is 'cleaned' after each boot/restart\n", "Q: Ubuntu One cloud issue I use Ubuntu One with my 12.04 LTS.\nSay, one of my folder is uploaded to the cloud, then I make some clean up operations by deleting and moving some files (in the local folder).\nBut when the folder is synchronized, the unwanted deleted files automatically downloaded to my local folder again.\nThis behaviour is really irritating, how can I solve this?\n\nA: If your local folder is not synchronized when you delete some files, and after you activate the synchronization again, the cloud can't guess if these files are actually to be deleted or not, and they are downloaded again to your local folder.\nIf you want to delete these files, you need firstg to activate the synchronization of the folder. So, when you delete a file, it will be deleted also from the cloud.\nAnyway you can also delete these files with the web interface.

Now, if I hold the modifiers down very consciously and press the alphanum key afterwards everything works fine. However, I noticed that I may often release the modifiers a bit too early. In Ubuntu 10.10 (metacity/compiz) my keyboard shortcuts would still execute and my tools would pop up. This does not work anymore in 12.04. Nevertheless, I still believe the old behavior to be more intuitive and would like to have it back.\nI a nutshell: Is there a parameter to control the shortcut-key-press detection behavior?\nI already searched the ubuntu keyboard options and searched for \"keyboard\" in gconf-editor but could not find any hints so far.\n\nA: Yes there is in the compiz settings. To install it:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nCompiz is a compositing manager, which means that it enhances the overall user interaction by adding fancy effects to your windows, from drop shadows to awesome desktop effects like the Desktop Cube or the Expo view.\nCompiz can also be a window manager, which means that it is the software between you and your desktop apps. It enables you to move or resize windows, to switch workspaces, to switch windows easily (using Alt-Tab or so), and so on. \nYou can install Compiz Setting Manager on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin/Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot/Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal/Linux Mint.\nThere is the respective setting you will be able to edit the shortcut keys.\n", "Q: Create a user for sharing purposes only I want to create simple user, who don't have any authority to use the system by logging in, but can access the resources shared on the network from a domain.\nI am under an impression that samba user need an ubuntu user to run. So, I am not sure, if this is exactly what i want as well.\nHow to create such users?\n\nA: You have to create a user under Ubuntu first.  To add a new Linux user account, simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Settings.\n\n*Choose User Accounts and unlock the panel using your administration password.\n\n*Use the + (plus) icon to create a new user.\n\n*Enter the new user’s full name (the user name will be filled in automatically based on the full name).\n\n\n\nAs this folder is for ‘sharing purposes only’ do not assign\n  ‘administrative rights’ to this user account.  When finished, click\n  Create. As the account is initially disabled, we now need to set the users password.\nNow when you return to the ‘Samba Users’ dialogue box and click ‘Add\n  User’, your new user account should be found in the Unix User name\n  drop-down box.\n\nSource: Sitepoint\n\nA: You almost certainly don't need to create such a user.\nSamba (in Ubuntu and in other operating systems) can be configured to provide resources, including shared folders, to anonymous users.\nFor example, to share a folder in Nautilus (the file browser) via Samba so that it's accessible over the network by anyone, without logging in, right-click on the folder, click Sharing Options, and check the box labeled Guest access (for people without a user account).\n\nThis is just one example (of the most common sort of situation where one may want to enable guest access). If you need information about how to configure Samba for guest access manually (by editing configuration files) or for other resources (besides a shared folder), you can edit your question to provide details.\n", "Q: How can I Simultaneous login to all the Virtual Terminals?

I want to develop an app for the new Ubuntu's contest, but I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I develop an \"existing\" app, which I added to Launchpad some days ago, but which no source code was uploaded?\n\n*Can I use external programs, such QEMU or Wget to develop them? For example, calling them with things like os.system().\n\n\nA: Regarding your first question, you are supposed to develop an app from scratch. But, I am sure the judges won't mind if you use some of the ideas and code from your existing app given that you were the one who created the other app as well.\n\n*\n\n*Can I use old code by myself to build on for my entry in the Ubuntu App Showdown contest?\nAnd for the second question, you can use anything as long as they exist in the Ubuntu 12.04 repositories. This restriction is because of the App Review Board guidelines.\nRelevant parts from the guidelines below:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can include any libraries that are part of your app. For example, if you're writing a Python game, and you've written a Python library to store character data, it's fine to include that with your app.\n\n\n*If your app depends on external libraries, please make sure that your app runs on the current versions shipped in Ubuntu.

I fixed a couple bugs with certain games, but on the whole I think it might be that my graphics drivers need an update.\nMy system is running Ubuntu 12.04 on a Dell Studio 1550 with a Intel Core i5 CPU M 430@2.27GHz × 4 n and 4 GB RAM, graphics card is just a standard Intel Integrated Graphics card, though I am currently unsure of which one.\nTried to manually find the drivers on Intel's website, but became a bit confused and overwhelmed with the number of links and information thrown at me.\nMy question is, really, can anyone help me to figure out how to download and install the updated drivers?\n\nA: more simple to write here (:\nso install mesa-utils \nand also install DRIconf:\ninstall from the software center:\n\nand after that, change the \"enable S3TC texture...\" to YES as shown here:\n\n", "Q: accidently blocked access to sudoers.d whilst trying to change ushare config Basically was trying to change the ushare config and needed permissions for some reason so, I changed with sudo -i and in the process did somthing and now I can't access superuser to change any of the permissions.\nAlso it says /etc/sudoers is mode 0660, but should be 0440 in the Terminal when I try and access it.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: You've changed the permissions of one or more of sudo's configuration files. Because the files could potentially lead to major insecurity on some systems with the wrong permissions, sudo refuses to work at all unless their permissions are set correctly. Since sudo will not work, you cannot use it to become root (the superuser) to fix them.\nHowever, there are actually two mechanisms used on a desktop Ubuntu system to perform actions as root: sudo, and PolicyKit. PolicyKit provides a command that you can use to run run non-graphical programs as root, similar to sudo: the pkexec command.\nIf your problem is that the file /etc/sudoers has the wrong permissions, you can fix this with:\npkexec chmod 440 /etc/sudoers\n\nThen you should be able to use sudo again. (You can try running a harmless command like sudo ls to find out.)\nIf there are files in /etc/sudoers.d that have the wrong permissions, you may have to set their permissions correctly, in a similar manner. Or just do it for all of them at once:\npkexec chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/*\n\n(Even the README file in there is required to have these restrictive permissions, so there should be no problem using that command. However, you likely don't need it, if it's just /etc/sudoers itself that got the wrong permissions.)\nSee also this related question.\n\nYou might have been tempted to change the permissions of /etc/sudoers or of a file in /etc/sudoers.d to edit it. You should not do this, and you do not need to. In the future, you should use visudo to edit these files instead. That does so safely, and prevents the problem you are now experiencing.\n", "Q: System Error Report - Xorg \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I enable or disable Apport? \n\n\n\nI am getting this error every time I restart my Laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad W520).

I need to delete Ubuntu 12.04 from my computer (windows 7 64 bit), is it possible?\nHow can i delete it? I coundn't find Ubuntu on add or remove programs in windows. \n\nA: Delete Ubuntu\nBoot live cd/usb of ubuntu, type gparted into the terminal, turn the Linux partition [ext4] and swap etc. into NTFS and format.\nRemove Grub\nBoot from the Windows CD, enter the recovery console press R when it asks you whether you want to install windows etc. When you're at the console, type:\nfixmbr\nand that will remove GRUB from your system. \nGot the grub bit from here\nFix Partitions\nYou might be able to try and extend your original windows partition over the old Ubuntu ones, but that might be dangerous territory. Otherwise you would have to reformat windows partition. Don't forget to make a full back up of your windows. \n\nA: Boot from the Windows CD, enter the recovery console press R when it asks you whether you want to install windows etc. When you're at the console, type:\nBootrec.exe/fixmbr\nBootrec.exe/fixboot\n\n\nA: A better way would be to first remove the grub installer and then to format the partition and then use the partition as NTFS. By this way you will not only remove the ubuntu but also make that free space available to windows.\nNote : Ubuntu uses EXT file system which windows does not support. So you will have to convert EXT file system to NTFS to make it usable for windows.\n", "Q: For photography use, is Unity is overheating my laptop? Should I try OpenSuse instead? I am a perfect noob here in the Linux world. Previously was using Windows 7.\nMine is an HP laptop - Intel core2duo T5470 @ 1.60GHz × 2 / 965GM with 2GB RAM.\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04TLS and is quite liking it's display. I really recognized it is 3D before knowing it was Unity 3D interface. My uses are image editing, home uses, downloads, browsing etc.. No video-editing/gaming at all. Being a Photography enthusiast I use image editing programs fairly more.\nBut I am now feeling my laptop is getting a bit overheated - processor and hard-disk.\nI tried lm-sensor and could not make out much of it. Installed Xsensors.7. It gives the same output as lm-sensors gave me. It gives temperature for 4 things> Temp1, temp2, temp3, and temp4.  For \"acpitz\". Please guide me in this.\nHowever I wanted to ask something more.\nWhich one is better for working with images - photography I mean - openSUSE 12.1 or Ubuntu with unity 3D? Can I get the display quality with the openSUSE distribution? I heard for laptops openSUSE uses power more efficiently, is there any truth?\nPlease suggest me whether I should try openSUSE or not. If so with which GUI? KDE or GNOME?\nThanks in advance.\n\nRegards \nSoT\n\nA: You won't find much difference between Ubuntu and OpenSuse other than the looks and feels, but functionality should be about the same.\nThe software you need to edit images (Gimp,Inkscape, etc...) will run in both systems flawlessly.\nThe overheating problem...some laptops models have been reported to suffer from overheating issues under linux (Ubuntu or OpenSuse). It might just be worth performing a google search for your model in particular.\nI personally prefer Ubuntu over Opensuse, but both are solid distributions and you will do just fine with either one.\n\nA: Welcome to AskUbuntu.com!\nI would recommend using Ubuntu.GNOMEorKDE` is matter of person preference. Try both, and see which one you like.\nRegarding Photography, much more will depend on your graphic card , processor and memory. \nWe have Photoshop alternative called GNU GIMP and Adobe Illustrator alternative called Inkscape\n", "Q: Can I continue playing music after suspending my laptop? I have a laptop with Ubuntu 12.04, I want to be able to play music with it while it is on hibernate mode, the problem is: When I close my laptop it goes to hibernation mode (I know this is a default and I know where to change this, but I can't change whether the system should play music during hibernation  or not) While I'm playing music, it stops the music as well (this too sounds logical because hibernation  mode is for saving power) But I'd like my computer to continue playing music. \nIs there a possibility of changing this? If not, can there be an update or something which creates a tiny option in the hibernation or the sound menu for this?\n\nA: The best way to save power AND play music is to just turn off the display\n\n*\n\n*Hibernate will not work. Hibernation means your computer saves its current state to the hard disk, and shuts down completely. You can't play music if your computer is off -- in the same way, you can't if it's hibernated.\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu actually suspends the computer when you close the lid, which is slightly different than hibernate in that it uses just a little bit of power and can resume instantly, but it makes no difference - the speakers, CPU, etc. are all still off.\n\n\n\nSet Ubuntu to \"Do Nothing\" when the lid is closed, and disable wireless if necessary\n\n*\n\n*The laptop component using the most power is usually the display; by setting the laptop to \"Do Nothing\" when you close the lid, it will turn off the display--saving a significant amount of power--and let your music continue playing.\n\n*\n\n*You can change this from System Settings...Power:\n\n\n\n\n*The CPU can use power if it is active, but Ubuntu manages this intelligently; playing music is not a CPU-heavy activity on any recent laptop.\n\n\n*If the music is on your hard disk, you can also try turning off wireless networking to save a little more power.\n\nA: This is not possible. Your PC is powered off in hibernate mode ( It is similar to shutdown , but has ability to save its state of work )\nSo you can't do this. You can put your Screen off and then play music.\n\nA: I don't think that is possible at the moment. When you close your laptop lid Ubuntu usually goes into suspend mode (not hibernate). In the Power management menu you can select to do nothing when laptop lid is closed...so it won't go into power saving mode but you will have your music still playing.\nYou can also go to Launchapd and make a feature request to the developers. Askubuntu is not the venue for that, but to solve doubts.\nYou could also start a session in Ubuntu with a media center (like XBMC) if you only interested in playing music and not doing anything else.\n\nA: Search, system settings.\nOpen.\nGo to power.\nWhen lid closed, change to do nothing.\nHowever your computer will not hibernate but still play music should be able to turn screen off too.\n\nA: This is 100% impossible, since hibernation in no way different from shutting down. When you trigger the hibernation mode, the computer saves everything in your RAM to the hard disk (except the files required to run the OS), and then goes to a power state exactly equivalent to being shut down. You cannot play music while in a suspended (sleeping in other OSes) as well.\nThe only way to save power is to turn off your computer screen. Go to System Settings -> Power if you are using a laptop.\n\nA: As noted above, playing music or doing any other activity on the computer is not possible at all, because hibernate = saving work in RAM to hard disk -> shut down like usual. However, you can turn off the screen while playing music to save power.\n", "Q: How do I find out which program is using internet and how much? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I find out which process is eating up my bandwidth?\n\nSometimes there is unusual internet activity on my Computer. The modem's lights are always blinking and when I open system monitor, I see there some unknown program is using my precious internet with 64KB/S (I have 512kbps connection). I am in a firefox session with only one tab opened, and the page is already loaded and there is no busy sign in the page (that rotating orange circle).\nIn that situation I unplug my modem and reconnect it again. After several times doing this, that unusual activity stops. It annoys me very much.\nHow can I find out the process which is using the Internet?. How much it is using?

You will probably get better results by telling us which process it is and then disabling it, instead of swatting it like a fly every time it pops up ;)\n\n", "Q: How can I download Windows 7 DVD installers from Ubuntu? I have rights for a free license of Windows 7, given by my University, and I need it now. According to Microsoft's instructions, to download the Windows DVD image I must:\n\n\n*\n\n*download a Secure Download Manager (SDM) installer (its a .pkg file)\n\n*run the .pkg file, which should install the SDM\n\n*download another file (.sdx), \n\n*run the .sdx file, which should start the download of the Windows DVD image.\n\n\nHowever, the SDM installer (.pkg) does not run.\nThe .sdx file, when opened in the text editor, is simply an internet address.

I have successfully used it to download Windows Server 2012 R2 from my DreamSpark student account while using Trusty Tahr.\nNote: The large file sizes of most everything on DreamSpark mean attempting this on a 32bit distro is a fruitless endeavour.

The site sees you're not using windows and redirects you.\nIf you trick it to think you're using Windows, e.g. by using Internet Explorer via wine or the \"user-agent switcher\" add-on for Firefox you should be able to download a .msi file which wine will be able to run.\nTL;DR: Here's a DL link\nP.S: If IE doesn't propely download, just copy the link over to your regular browser ;)\n", "Q: Ubuntu video playback with horizontal lines and other artifacts Ever since Ubuntu 7.04, I've always had the same problem, the bad playback from my good quality videos (HD, blue-ray, and others).\nI have used many computers and many different video cards from then but the problems still exist. How can I convince my friends to use this operating system when they need it most for multimedia (as many people today)? In Windows (XP please!) I had much better playback.\nI really was waiting a long time for a solution and is the first time I am writing to you, community, but I think that the only solution is Windows 7.\nThank you very much for listening me.\n\nA: Try these procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update Ubuntu\n\n*Downoload Latest GFX Driver ( ATI or Nvidia )\n\n*Download Latest Codecs for your Video\n\n\nA: What video player are you (have you) been using?  Video plays fine for me on a nice monitor and nice PC (ASUS 27inch Monitor, AMD 1090t, 16GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce 550).  \nIf the video you are watching in interlaced, try playing in VLC and enable deinterlacing.\nAdditionally, ATI has not fully delivered a driver that can completely capitalize on the capabilities of your ATI video card.  Let ATI know how you feel buying buying another chipset, or alternatively, use the Intel graphics provided by your motherboard.\nAlso, I might mention that your processor (E6600) is over half a decade old, so it might not be the best platform with which to enjoy 1080P video (you mentioned blu-ray).\nI might also mention that, if you get an Nvidia card (Geforce 8800 or better, $20), you can use vdpau to offload video decoding tasks to your video card, thus freeing your older CPU for other tasks.\n\nA: If you use fglrx for your video card, you may want to uninstall it, or if you don't use it you may want to install it. Could you tell me which you have (if you know, if you don't, did you install the ATI proprietary drivers from the additional drivers dialog (or jockey) ?)\nEDIT Another possible solution, if viable, or at least a check to see if the monitor is the problem, is to borrow a monitor from a friend and try to use that to playbback video. If the horizontal lines show up still, ubuntu is the problem. However, if they disappear, you should get a new monitor.\nIf ubuntu is the problem, you could try reinstalling it or updating all your packages (maybe an update fixes the problem). However, if neither of these work, you could file a bug report at launchpad.\nA third possibiliy is the disk drive is bad. If you can find a USB disk drive, try that out too to see if ubuntu runs video better.\n", "Q: How to fix 'grub error file not found' when installing 12.04? i'm trying to install Ubuntu.\nI don't know if it is important, but i'm trying to install it on external HDD.\nIn the end i have external bootable HDD which only displays:\nerror: file not found\ngrub recovery>\n\nFrom the beginning:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've downloaded ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso\n\n*I've used LiLi USB Creator (LinuxLive) to create bootable pendrive from that image\n\n*I've bootet from it, it works\n\n*I've clicked \"Try ubuntu\", it works too.\n\n\nI've used GParted to look over drivers (disks)\nMy primary embedded disk is seen as /dev/sda\nMy attached external disk as  /dev/sdb\nMy PenDrive as /dev/sdc\n\n\n*\n\n*I've created partitions on /dev/sdb\n\n*Fist partition for system (over 200GiB)\n\n*Second was there already (it's xsf, and i don't want to touch it :P)\n\n*Third is extended partition, with 1 locital partiton (10GiB) for swap\n\n*I've started installation\n\n*i've choose \"somethin else\" in ... i belive secound screeb\n\n*then is selected /dev/sdb as boot disk \n\n*for first partiton of /dev/sdb i set i want ext3 file system, i've check \"formattin\" checkbox, and mount path set to \"/\"\n\n*firs logical partiton set as swap partition \n\n\nAfter installation finished, i restarted my computer.\nWhen i boot from my primary disc it's work ok, my previous operating system - vista - works ok.\nWhen i set my BIOS to boot from my external disc, i only get that message:\nerror: file not found\ngrub recovery>\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I've try to reinstall it, but didn't help...\n\n\nIn desperation, i've try to read a bit about that \"grub recovery>\" command-line and experiment a bit...\nI'm not sure if this has had any point, or if it give you some information (notice, that i don't know what i'm doing :P )\nwhen i've type command:\ninsmod (hd1,1)/boot/grub/linux.mod\n\ni've get message:\nunknown filesystem\n\nthe same with:\ninsmod (hd1,msdos1)/boot/grub/linux.mod\n\nthe same with:\ninsmod ext3\n\nbut i get no message after command:\ninsmod ext2\n\n...\nnotice that i really don't know what this command exactly do,\nbut than i thought that maybe if i reinstall ubuntu with ext2 filesystem, it will work.\nI've done that, but symptoms are the same.\nI've go back to that Live version of ubuntu, filesystem and basics directories seems to be present on /dev/sdb1 ... i'm completely unfamiliar with GRUB.

What happens is that the BIOS can't read blocks past a certain point in the drive, and so if your root filesystem starts before that limit, but ends after that limit, then some files will be accessible at boot through the BIOS and others won't. The standard way to work around this problem is to create a small /boot/ partition near the beginning of the drive, to ensure that everything that needs to be read through the BIOS, can be.\nI would normally expect \"out of disk\" errors from grub were this the case, and I don't know why we're not seeing those. One way to confirm that the problem is a BIOS limit is to go into your BIOS menus and see what size it lists the drive as being, if it lists it as being less that the actual size, you know your BIOS is buggy. Another way, if your BIOS doesn't list sizes anywhere in its menus, is to run \"ls -l\" from grub and look at the size listed there. Unfortunately, you can't run \"ls -l\" from the rescue shell, so you'd need to boot from a grub CD, or have already fixed the problem with a small /boot/ partition, before you could do the check from within grub.\n\nA: Change your booting preferences to boot from the external hard disk. The computer is trying to find grub on your in- built HDD but its actually in the external HDD. So you will have to change your booting options to use that external HDD for booting as the first preference and then the in - built HDD the second preference. So if your insert your external HDD then it will automatically boot ubuntu and if you don't then it will boot up the system that you have installed it in the in - built HDD.\n\nA: If your still having issues with this try the \"GRUB Customizer\"\n\nsudo apt-get grub-customizer \n\nPLUG IN YOUR PENDRIVE or external USB\n\nstart it from the gui Administrator tools Admin->grub-Customizer or Q!\n\nAfter it starts it will read your boot script similar to bootinfoscript so wait a few seconds for it to finish then the boot information window will change color from grey to normal.\nYou can then edit the boot information for each drive as it was found.\nto Add a new entry just press edit->Add then select Linux.\nusing the tab button verify that the disk UUID matches the disk you want to boot from.\nclick finish.\nclick save button\nverify your edits manual view the grub-boot menu to ensure edits were saved. I am assuming your grub boot loader is on hd0 or sda0.\ncat out \n\n/hd0/boot/grub/grub.cfg    # don't edit this file just view or verify it. or run your bootinfoscript again.\n\nif this doesn't fix the problem then you could be having issues with the kernel.  I had to reinstall my Ubuntu-LTS this way because another Linux 64bit install diddled with the boot loader too much. If your using a 64bit machine then verify that the usb-drive /pendrive is also 64-bit OS. Otherwise the USB driver will fork when it tries to load the USB drive.\nIt was a good idea that the new OS be kept small about 6-10MB so you don't hit the upper bound limits on Large GB-HDs. You also need to verify that any external USB drivers are installed before grub runs. To do this press the down-arrow key on the purple screen to see what modules are being installed and which ones fork.\nIf this didn't help you try using a rescue disk to pick up the missing kernel/files.\nI use bootrecovery-CD (sourceforge:boot-repair-diskx64) or Linux-remix-CD (www.ubuntu-rescue-remix.org) when things go wrong with Grub-Customizer.\n", "Q: Installing ZFS changed my sudoers file Following the wiki's advice, I installed ubuntu-zfs.

I'd like to run a script on shut down, which interrupts the logout process and and pops up a window with zenity. My target is to get autofsck working with lightdm. It seems to work with 12.04 after installing the old *.deb file, if one runs the check script manually. In order to use it, it should run automatically on log out and ask the user if she/he wants to check the disc on shutdown.\nThere is the option session-cleanup-script in the file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf which seems to work, if a bash file with full path is used (I can't place the command directly there). But if I press shutdown, there is no time for a user choice.\nIs there any other option to solve this problem?\nEdit: It seems as if there are also other problems specificially with AutoFsck. The session clean up script runs, but the check command for AutoFsck does not run.\n\nA: I believe your shutdown/powerdown question is (more-or-less) answered here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logout scripts: not completed on shutdown, reboot\nWhen looking at the answer(s) provided there, I would like to tweak/elaborate/summarize you probably need both, to use the session-cleanup-script such that X will not die before you can respond and run the job, and a new, smallish /etc/init.d/ script at a high enough run level to 'block' shut down until your session-cleanup-script invoked AutoFsck script completes.\nThus: \n\n\n*\n\n*Add to session-cleanup-script setting a flag via 'touch /etc/noreboot' (or similar) that is cleared by your AutoFsck calling script (i.e. remove /etc/noreboot file when answered no, or, if yes, removed only after AutoFsck is completed).\n\n*Your new /etc/init.d script must check for existence of /etc/noreboot and if it exists, check again every second or two in a while loop until the file is removed.  Once /etc/noreboot is not existed, the script can complete and allow the rest of the shutdown process to continue.  Again, the key here is to make sure the init.d script runs before the lightdm shutdown or any other X shutdown runs.\nSince X should still be running while the /etc/noreboot check script in init.d is running, you can also send an X message to the screen saying that shutdown is blocked awaiting removal of the file.  This little nuisance message might come in handy if the /etc/noreboot file is not cleared for some reason, preventing your system from a graceful shutdown.\n", "Q: Can Windows and Ubuntu share a single swap partition? I am dual booting my system with Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7. I have created the special swap partition for Ubuntu while installing (as recommended).\nCan Windows use this swap area/partition--as its own swap/page file--when I boot from Windows?\n\nA: If your goal is to save hard drive space -- not having to waste many GBs for both Linux's swap and Windows's pagefile, then you might consider using dynamic swapfile size on linux via SwapSpace:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/134258/dynamically-growing-swap-file-on-debian\n\n*http://www.hecticgeek.com/2012/01/automatic-virtual-swap-space-creator-ubuntu-linux/\n\nA: It's possible, but probably only as an experiment:\n\nNote: This is a what-if answer and is not recommended, especially if you are using hibernate from Ubuntu!\n\n\n*\n\n*In theory, yes, Windows should be able to use your swap partition for its page (swap) file with some clever scripting on the Linux side.\n\n\n*I'm not going to do a step-by-step because I haven't tried it and if you can't figure out how to implement this you shouldn't be trying it either :)\n\n*\n\n*Format the partition as NTFS from within Windows and set up Windows to use that drive exclusively for its swap file (nothing on C:)\n\n\n*Have a startup/upstart script to format the partition as Linux swap on Ubuntu startup and enable swap (swapon).\n\n\n*Have a shutdown script to swapoff and reformat the partition as ntfs.\nAlternative (still not recommended) option:\nYou can create a swap file by following this guide on the NTFS partition, provided the NTFS partition is large enough for both swap files.\nHowever this alternative is not recommended because:\n\n*\n\n*Swapping on an NTFS(3G) partition would be extremely CPU-heavy.\n\n*And to make things worse, since the file can/will be fragmented, that would also cause a performance hit.\n\n\nA: I haven't tried it myself but you can mount a swap partition with swapfs. You can then, in theory, place your pagefile there (there's some good reasons not to, such as minidumps, but its an option). \n\nA: It works great. \nWhats needed? Just follow the instruction in the SwapFs-3.0 file.\nAlso you could find some helpful stuff at How To use Linux Swap Partition as Windows Swap file on Ubuntuforums.org.\nAt first I tried to format swap space into NTFS but turned out that Linux lost ability to recognize it as an own created. \nThen I reformatted it back to classical Linux swap. \nNext I changed back fstab. Was:\nUUID=4c6a4... none  swap  sw  0  0\n\nDeactivated that and put instead:\n/dev/sda7   swap   swap   defaults   0   0\n\nIf I remember well, after I booted into Windows it didn't recognized it as RAW or if I could have formatted it as FAT32. \nAnd everything started working. \nBut a problem appear. Namely my Vista 'attached' an additional letter, thus at last had two drivers but in fact linked with the same partition 'e:\\' and established by me as 's:\\'. \nFortunately it was enough to get to the registry to place recommended in *.reg file, from 'SwapFs-3.0'. Turned out that the extra additional record 'e:\\' should be removed from registry. \nRight now enjoying inter-system swap space without problems. Recovered 3.2 GB space. \nI would like to mention that using Linux just 4 three months and be able to do such complicated operations, thus you could do this without any enormous effort.\nRecapitulating:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is possible to share Linux swap partition with Windows and exploit it as space to store Windows swap file.\n\n*It is very easy thanks SwapFs-3.0.\n\n*Could not tell how much it is CPU-heavy.\n\n*The partition is not recognized by \"manage\" command as mounted as well as Partition Apps do not seen it as mounted.\n\n*Explorer sees it as a disk.\n\n*Indeed it could save a lot of disk space. \n\n\nA: Things have changed... There used to be an IFS driver that could read Linux Partitions (primarily for EXT3 at the time) IFS by the way means Installable FileSystem - which may have began in MS-DOS 4 (I previously thought it was an element from OS2 that remained in Windows), there were some interesting things you could do with IFS, like create a RAM Drive, and assign it a drive letter.  (these days imdisk is probably a better way of doing that)  Along with EXT2IFS (and later ext2fsd) was the ability to access Linux Swap Partitions from within windows.  So all you needed to do was use the small drive manager utility that came with the filesystem driver to assign a drive letter to the Swap Partition and tell windows to use that for the I think it was the swapfile.sys file, etc...  Nowerdays Windows10 since the Anniversary update require Signed Drivers and most IFS drivers currently do not function at least for me, which, sadly, robs me of access to my EXT2 and HFS+ partition data from within Windows.  So the answer has essentially become no longer.  But for older Versions (such as Win7 or XP) it's quite plausible to do by the method I stated here.\n\nA: The short answer is: No, it cannot.\nWindows does not recognize Linux partitions, although the opposite is possible (linux recongnizes windows partitions).\n", "Q: Why is my AMD Quad 645 CPU running at 800MHz per core on Ubuntu 12.04 I've just loaded Ubuntu 12.04 onto a brand box with an AMD 645 quad CPU with 8GB RAM.\nIn the BIOS it says, the CPU is running at 3100MHz.

I have a VPS running Ubuntu server 12.04. A while ago, my host installed an alternative kernel (one of Amazon's EC2 kernels) to fix a boot issue I was having. Now, 2 Ubuntu releases later, this kernel (2.6.31-302-ec2) is still being used even though later (3.2.xx) kernels have been installed.\nHow can I make the server use the most recent installed kernel, preferably without just uninstalling the EC2 kernel just in case doing so causes issues?\n\nA: Congratulations, you're on PyGrub!\n\n\n*\n\n*Your menu.lst file, the different kernel images in your /boot directory and most importantly, the kernel you're running (an Amazon EC2 version extremely unlikely to be running on a physical host) strongly imply you do have pygrub enabled.\n\n*\n\n*This is because non-Pygrub XenPVs must use the same kernel as the host\n\n\n*The oddly empty dmesg is likely a side-effect of the customizations in the EC2 kernel; compare with the very informative output of a normal kernel on a XenPV 3.4\n\n\nA little bit on XenPV kernel options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your current custom EC2 kernel boots with the options root=/dev/sda1 xencons=tty (see end of menu.lst)\n\n*The standard XenPV boot options on stock kernels, instead are root=/dev/xvda1 console=hvc0\n\n*\n\n*xvda is the paravirtualized (and more efficient)  disk device, while sda is the less efficient emulated device -- this is the first time I've seen the latter used in a 3.x XenPV.\n\n*xencons=tty and console=hvc0 are very similar, but I believe the former is an older (legacy) usage; you can stack them with no ill-effects; it simply tells the kernel that the standard virtual terminal is unavailable for the console, and to use the specialized hvc0 device instead.\n\n\n\nHow to switch kernels:\nThis part may be slightly hairy, and you should be in your provider's good books because you may need their help with a simple cp operation once or twice! After that, you'll know what options you need and should be set for the future.\n\n\n*\n\n*To give you some context if you need it, here are some files from my XenPV VPS on the latest 64-bit kernel: ls -l /boot, menu.lst and a full post-boot dmesg\n\n*Add the following at the top of your menu.lst, adapting to the kernel version you need:\n\ndefault=0\ntitle vmlinuz-3.2.0-25-generic\nroot            (hd0) \nkernel          /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-25-generic ro root=/dev/sda1 xencons=tty console=hvc0\ninitrd      /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-25-generic\n\n\n*Cross your fingers, reboot, and hope it comes back up!\n\n*If not, try changing to root=/dev/xvda1 and that should almost certainly work.\n\n*Remember to decline installing \"new\" menu.lst when upgrading kernels!\n\n\nA: By default xen guests (domU) can't control what kernels are being used. \nThe kernel is provisioned from the hypervisor (dom-0) where the specific kernel version is hard coded  along with ip , memory disk size etc in the config script for each virtual machine.\nUnless your VPS provider has enabled pygrub which allows the use and boot of custom kernels within the VPS. if that is the case have a look at this instruction\nXen and PyGrub \n\nA: Search Grub Customizer in software center.\nInstall the program.\nThen open Grub Customizer.\nIt you can uncheck any of the older kernels and check the newer ones.\nWhen ubuntu boots it will only see the ones that are checked.\nHope this helps,\nLeinardo\n", "Q: What is meant by \"Novelty\" in Ubuntu App Contest?

But when I reach partition selection step, it gives me error \"ubi-partman failed with exit code 141\".\nI searched forums for this but those who encountered this error said it was resolved when they detached one of two HDs in their system. But I have only one hard disk attached and I am sure Ubuntu's GRUB supports GPT. But looks like it is not able to read GPT partitions on my HD. Any help regarding this will be appreciated.\n\nA: Your parted output suggests you've got a partition table problem, or at least an issue that libparted (which is used both by the text-mode parted program and the Ubuntu partitioner) is interpreting as a partition table problem. The \"Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character\" message suggests that parted is having problems interpreting the partition name, which is officially a UTF16-encoded name. Unfortunately, the last time I checked, parted didn't do proper UTF-16 encoding or decoding of partition names; instead, it tried to interpret them as a sort of modified ASCII -- or in practice, a modified UTF-8. This could lead to problems if a real UTF-16 partition name used non-ASCII characters, since they might then look like gibberish when interpreted as a modified UTF-8. Since libparted is very sensitive to errors and offers little in the way of corrective tools, the result is an error, as both parted and the Ubuntu installer demonstrate.\nIf I'm right (and I'm far from certain that I am), you should be able to correct the problem as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the Ubuntu (or any other Linux) rescue disk.\n\n*If necessary, download and install GPT fdisk (gdisk). It's available as the gdisk package in Ubuntu.\n\n*Type sudo gdisk /dev/sda to launch gdisk on your problem disk.\n\n*Type v to verify the disk's data structures. If gdisk reports any problems, it could be that parted was reacting to some problem other than the partition name, and that may need to be dealt with instead of (or at least before) proceeding with the below steps.\n\n*Type p to view your partition table. Look for any non-ASCII characters in the \"Name\" column.\n\n*Type c to change the name of any partition that has a strange name. You'll be asked for a partition number and a new name. Repeat this for as many partitions as necessary (up to all of them).\n\n*Type p to review your partition table to be sure everything looks sane.\n\n*If everything looks good, type w to save your changes and exit from gdisk.\n\n\nIf my suspicion is correct, you should now be able to proceed with Ubuntu installation. If I'm correct, this is a libparted bug, which should be reported to Ubuntu and/or to the libparted developers. Recording the names of all your partitions for inclusion in your bug report is worth doing.\n\nA: Use Wubi Ubuntu iso to install Ubuntu to dual boot with Windows. I had done so and it worked fine.

If you want a different version from what is in the PPA you need to set your own version number greater than what is in the PPA.\nAs a word of caution, note that 1.2.3-1ppa1~2 is less than 1.2.3-1ppa1, so apt-get upgrade would upgrade to 1.2.3-1ppa1.

Is there a way to quickly check for the availability of security updates from the command line?\nOn my 12.04 system running apt-get update fetches 20MB of data about available packages every time I run it, hitting many repositories along the way. Then I can use any of the methods described here to actually perform the update.\nMy question is just about detecting the availability of security updates (ie, not performing the actual upgrade using apt-get/aptitude/etc): is there a quick check that can be done from the command line that provides a yes-no answer the question \"are there security updates available?\". I would like to run that before running the lengthy apt-get update + actual upgrade. \nI suppose I don't need to download 20MB of data to know the answer to that every day.\n\nA: This may not be exactly what the question is asking, but if you've already run apt update, you can see what security updates are available using:\nsudo apt list --upgradable | grep -e \"-security\"\n\nwhich will give you something like:\nlibssl1.0.0/xenial-updates,xenial-security 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.9 i386 [upgradable from: 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.8]\nopenssl/xenial-updates,xenial-security 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.9 i386 [upgradable from: 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.8]\n\n\nA: \nMy question is just about detecting the availability of security updates\n\nYes, that's doable with the caveat that the normal apt-get update will do a full refresh when you next run it (20 MB means it's doing that anyway).\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo sh -c 'grep precise-security /etc/apt/sources.list > /etc/apt/secsrc.list\n\n*And if you then run the following, you'll see if there are any security updates available (sample output):\n\nsudo sh -c 'apt-get -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist=\"secsrc.list\" \\\n-o Dir::Etc::sourceparts=\"-\" update && \\\napt-get --assume-no upgrade'\n\n\n*This tells apt-get to temporarily use the special security-only sources list, and then runs upgrade, automatically answering no.\n\n*If there are any, run proper apt-get update (which will do a full refresh), and then upgrade.\n\n*You could make the above a bash script with a simple grep/exit code check at the end if you don't feel like parsing the apt-get output :)\n", "Q: How can i disable autohiding of the top panel in scribes?

However, if you're after the executable process's name, you can do it with psutil and some other functions.\nFirst, install psutil with pip (Python 2) or pip3 (Python 3).  If the command isn't found then install the python-pip or python3-pip packages depending on which Python version you're working with:\n# Python 2\nsudo pip install psutil\n\n# Python 3\nsudo pip3 install psutil\n\nNext, we can use psutil in any given Python script, and pass a PID.  This is an example of what it can do, by running python3 in the command line, working with the interactive Python 3 shell, and getting that process's information using Python code right on the Python shell:\n>>> import psutil\n>>> import os\n>>> os.getpid()\n6284\n>>> p = psutil.Process(os.getpid())\n>>> p.name()\n'python3'\n>>> p.exe()\n'/usr/bin/python3.5'\n>>> p.cmdline()\n['python3']\n>>>\n\nAs you can see you can get different information from the system about the process on both Windows or Linux with these utilities, though you still need to install the Python package first.\n\nEDIT\nWe can also chain this with Jacob Vlijm's answer here too, to get the PID and pass it into psutil (Note that I shorten 'subprocess' to 'sp' in my import, but it's still the subprocess module):\nimport psutil\nimport subprocess as sp\n\np = psutil.Process(int(sp.check_output([\"xdotool\", \"getactivewindow\", \"getwindowpid\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()))\n\n... and then continue to use psutil to extract specific data.\n\nA: import wnck\nscreen = wnck.screen_get_default()\nwindow = screen.get_active_window()\npid = window.get_pid()\n\n", "Q: How to open mutilple instances of the Terminal?

Your account password is the password to all your data.\nIf you still want to let everyone use your account, you could create a second account, let's call it notes and use that instead. Then you can call:\nsu notes\ntomboy\n\nThis will then prompt for the notes's users password.\nOr you use a tool like TrueCrypt, create an encrypted container and move your notes into there.\n\nA: You can launch the application with gksudo to start it in super-user mode, e.g. to start Tomboy issue the command gksudo tomboy. You'll be presented with a graphical password prompt and after you enter correct password the application will be started in super-user(root) mode.However, if you want to change this behaviour in the Application Menu then you have to change the Exec= line of the .desktop file corresponding to the application by adding gksudo after Exec= .i.e. Exec=gksudo tomboy.

Use ls -l on the web root folder to find ownership of the files.  Make sure that the group part is www-data.  If its in any user-level folders (such as your home directory), make sure that www-data can read the file directory structure to there.\nWithout more details, though, I can't explain how to fix this any better...  attaching details about the file structure, where on the drive your files are sitting, etc. may help.\n(Source: Me, as I'm on the nginx team)\n", "Q: Dual monitors - I'm almost there, but my mouse cant cross the divide I'm having a very strange problem with the open-source radeon drivers.

Any advice?\n\nA: I simply installed the xserver-xorg-input-elographics package from the repos. Once that was installed my screen magically began to work.\n", "Q: Delete all traces of windows from Ubuntu I used to have a dual boot in one of my hard disk drives - Ubuntu and Windows 7. Then, I added a SSD which is now my main hard disk drive, and I'm using it for Windows 7 completely, keeping Ubuntu in the old HD. I restored the Grub so everything works ok, except for one thing.\nEverytime I update the grub, it detects two windows:\nFound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda1\nFound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sdb1\n\nObviously, I don't want it to detect the Windows on sdb1. Because I no longer use it (I manually deleted the files). What can I do about that without wiping out completely the partition?\n\nA: I'm not sure what it uses to detect the OS.  I'd try a quick reformat of the partitions.  \nIf nothing else works, here is a patch that can be made to /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober that will allow you to specify any partitions you want to skip:\n/etc/grub.d/30_os-prober modification\nThese lines can be added to the file (just past the middle) to skip any partitions that you don't want to show up in the menu.  Leaving the string empty will skip nothing.\nAdd the lines starting with \n############## Patch to prevent some partitions being autodetected\nthrough\n############## End of patch:\nfor OS in ${OSPROBED} ; do\n  DEVICE=\"`echo ${OS} | cut -d ':' -f 1`\"\n  LONGNAME=\"`echo ${OS} | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr '^' ' '`\"\n  LABEL=\"`echo ${OS} | cut -d ':' -f 3 | tr '^' ' '`\"\n  BOOT=\"`echo ${OS} | cut -d ':' -f 4`\"\n\n  ############## Patch to prevent some partitions being autodetected\n  SKIP_THESE_DEVICES=\"sdb1\"\n  # SKIP_THESE_DEVICES=\"sda1 sdb1 sdb2\"   example for multiple devices\n  # SKIP_THESE_DEVICES=\"\"                 example for no devices\n\n  PARTITIONNAME=\"`echo ${DEVICE} | cut -c 6- 2> /dev/null`\"\n  if [ \"`echo ${SKIP_THESE_DEVICES} | grep -e ${PARTITIONNAME} 2> /dev/null`\" ] ; then\n    continue\n  fi\n  ############## End of patch\n\n  if [ -z \"${LONGNAME}\" ] ; then\n    LONGNAME=\"${LABEL}\"\n  fi\n\nAfter changing this file, you will, of course, need to run sudo update-grub to regenerate the menu.  You should be able to see the results from the terminal's output when it says \"Found ...\" for each entry; you can run it first before the mods, then compare the output to after the mods.  You should not see the removed entries.\n\nA: If Windows 7 is still getting detected, it means that the parition you made still contains some bootloader files of Windows 7. Why not delete the partition itself? That will definitely solve this issue.\nI suggest that you keep a backup of any files you want, and delete the partition of your Windows 7 in your old HD. After that update the grub. \nI don't think I need to suggest tools to you, but Gparted is the best partition editor from what I know.\n\nA: You should use a Gparted live cd to delete your windows partition on the old HD. But you may have to fix grub after you do this.\n\nA: With grub2, you can skip a device by adding a line similar to the following in your /etc/default/grub file:\nGRUB_OS_PROBER_SKIP_LIST=\"A523009BEFE25938@/dev/sdb1\"\n\nGRUB_OS_PROBER_SKIP_LIST is a space-separated list of devices that should be skipped during the os probing stage of update-grub. Each device is of the format <UUID>@<DEVICE>, where DEVICE is the skipped device's path, and UUID is its blkid, which you can obtain by typing:\nblkid /dev/sdb1\n\nOnce you've updated your /etc/default/grub file, just run update-grub.\nsudo update-grub\n\nIn the output, you should see if the device was successfully skipped.\n\nA: You can use wipefs to wipe the filesystem metadata so that the NTFS Windows partition is no longer detected. You will loose all the data in the partition.\nYou simply run\nsudo wipefs -a /dev/sdb1\n\nThe command ends in the second it is run and it is quicker that deleting the partition or deleting the files.\n", "Q: How to mount drive without partition table? I have an Ubuntu 10.4 slice on RackspaceCloud that is no longer responding after trying to upgrade to 11.10. I used their \"Rescue Mode\" to boot another slice with access to my old server, which gives me the following information on my main partition when I use fdisk -l:\n\nroot@server:~# fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/xvdb: 81.6 GB, 81604378624 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9921 cylinders, total 159383552 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/xvdb doesn't contain a valid partition table    \n\nWhen I try and mount this, it won't let me without fixing this issue:\n\nroot@server:~# mount /dev/xvdb /mnt \n  mount: you must specify the filesystem type\n\nI'm guessing that the lack of a partition table is why I can't boot into the server -- is there a way to fix this or at least get access to the data on this disk?\nUPDATE:\nJust tried again with a fresh rescue instance and got a little closer with:\nroot@server:/var/log# mount /dev/xvdb /mnt\nroot@server:/var/log# cd /mnt\nroot@server:/mnt# ls -l\ntotal 16\ndrwx------ 2 root root 16384 2012-06-17 14:33 lost+found\n\nThe lost+found folder is all that is in the newly mounted drive which I suspect is because of the missing partition table again. \nI'm new at working with partitions on ubuntu, so I may be making an obvious mistake -- any resource suggestions or other tricks greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Lack of a partition table is not the issue.  You appear to have an entirely blank drive in the first instance, and in the second, you have a freshly formatted one.  Perhaps your xen configuration is pointing the drive to the wrong location?\n", "Q: How do I fix \"bzr: ERROR: Unable to determine your name. \"?

You can find them by searching for \"shortcut\" in the Kickoff menu.\n\nFor example, to change the hotkey for the Mute action, you go to Global Keyboard Shortcuts and select KMix (which responds for sound).\n\nTo add your own shortcuts, you can go to Custom Shortcuts. Let's make a shortcut for KCalc – KDE's default calculator. Right-click on the box to the left, select New → Global Shortcut → Command/URL.

Another question today; I have gnome-shell installed on both my laptop and my desktop, but on my desktop it acts entirely different then if it is on my laptop.\nI know that sounds weird, so here is a description:\nOn my laptop, Gnome-Shell is used through a menu (accessed using the windows button on my keyboard, or an on-screen button) which lists all my open applications and workspaces.

I made an customized version of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with my required software, but after customization, wubi.exe does not work. Any idea how to make it work again? \n\nA: \nPlease note that customizing Ubuntu for Wubi may require some additional steps, compared to customizing a standard LiveCD.\n\nThe Wubi Customization section in the official Wubi Guide contains some hints and tips.\nThe guide also talks about customizing Wubi itself and using Wubi for non-Ubuntu distributions, so I have included the points I think are most relevant for your needs/problem, along with my comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Live CD with ubiquity + casper + lupin-support (which provides lupin-casper)\n\n\n*\n\n*If your custom LiveCD boots and works, then you already have ubiquity+casper; just check that you don't remove lupin-support during customization.\n\n\n*The ISO must have a .disk/info formatted like the one in the Ubuntu ISO and with data matching what you provided in the isolist.ini\n\n\n*\n\n*This is very important - a customized CD is always going to contain more/less/different files than a stock Ubuntu LiveCD, so you will need to ensure that the .disk/info files contain this list, and also modify isolist.ini with this information.\n\n\n*If you want users to be able to download the ISO, in your web server you need to provide a metalink file for each ISO provided, the md5 of said metalink files, and the signature of the md5s. To verify the signature you need to add the signing key to data/trustedkeys.gpg. If this is too much trouble, you can disable signature checks in data/settings.nsh. The metalink file must be on a \"stable\" URL since that is hardcoded in isolist.ini. The metalink file can in turn point to all your mirrors. You will notice that 2 metalink files are provided in isolist.ini, one is for final release, and one for development versions. \n\n\n*\n\n*I don't think this matters if you are using the local ISO for installation.\n\n\n*Your Linux distribution must have a mechanism to do unattended installation using a preseed file. Wubi takes advantages of debian-installer/ubiquity presiding. If you use a different mechanism, you will have to modify src/wubi/installer_preseed.nsh. The make prerequisite scripts may need to be updated as well, since they are Debian specific.\n\n\n*\n\n*Preseeding refers to the automated/unattended installation script, which basically contains answers to all the questions users are normally asked during an interactive installation. Your customization may modify some of these questions, so you would have to modify the preseed file accordingly.\n\n\n", "Q: Accomplishments installation problem, not showing trophies Installed via the PPA.\nWith 0.1 I would get a force close upon starting the Accomplishments app. \nWith 0.2 It starts fine, I was prompted to sign into Ubuntu One and the app remains blank.

I also normally make the scroll wheel page down for each click (otherwise it hurts my arms to be scrolling so much).  I make pushing the wheel to the left = pageback and pushing to the right = page forward.\nI've searched for other answers to this and found something related here\nBut when I posted a followup post to solve the issue, no one responded --perhaps I made the mistake of posting to a question that had been \"solved.\"  I'm not sure how I'm supposed to reopen a question that is pertinent to my question but doesn't quite solve mine.\n\nA: You should install Solaar, a Linux tool that allows you to manage Logitech Unifying Receiver mice and keyboards, that comes with both a GUI and command line interface.

The good news is that it was expensive (for a mouse) and the manufacture actually built it to a high standard.  The functions for the mouse are stored in the mouse.  The bad news is to configure it correctly you need to use the logitech software that only runs in windows.\nSo...basically you need to plug the mouse into a windows box, and configure it exactly how you want it.  I'd recommend utilizing the switch profiles function so you can set it up good for normal usage, ie: running your linux desktop, compiz functions (switching apps, switching workspaces, toggling maximize, etc), and then make another profile for gaming (possibly with a different refresh rate) and the gaming buttons.  As for compiz consider setting the 4 side thumbs buttons to alt, ctl, shift, superkey, as this will make using switching easier with the scroll wheel.  alt + scroll wheel up becomes thumb button 1 + scroll wheel up.\nMy scheme:\nthumb button 1 (forward lower) = alt\nthumb button 2 (forward upper) = shift\nthumb button 3 (rear lower) = ctrl\nthumb button 4 (rear upper) = superkey (windows key)\nindex finger middle button = ctrl + alt + numpad 5\nindex finger closer to you = tab\nindex finger farther away from you = alt-f4 (compiz/linux/winX close app)\ncompiz defaults:\nswitch workspace = alt + ctl + mouse drag = lower 2 thumb buttons together + mouse click and drag; sounds complicated when typed it out but it's very efficient to use.\nswitch apps = alt + tab = lower thumb forward button + index finger closer button (remember for this to work well you need to keep holding down thumb button, so you can switch past 1 app)\nfading a window (transparency) = alt + scroll wheel = thumb lower forward button + scroll wheel\nThen go haul it back over to your linux box and it works perfectly.\nThe key bindings described above works great, but consider battlefield 4 also has a terrible time recognizing the mouse as a mouse with 10 buttons so for that I had to map my 4 thumb buttons to = , \\ and ;.  But obviously in linux this is silly, and to re-bind the = key to \"next app\" is a lesson in futility, especially when coding hahahaha.\nMUCH NEEDED LINKS IF USING VIRTUALBOX TO RUN WINDOWS 7:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/20021300/usb-devices-are-not-recognized-in-virtualbox-linux-host\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0OyrvbZNwo\n\nA: The best answer in 2021 is the Key Mapper utility:\nhttps://github.com/sezanzeb/key-mapper\nNo more hacking required.\n2023 update:\nOne potential problem with this tool is that it installs a background service that registers a dummy game controller to achieve the key mapping functionality.\nUnfortunately, this can trick some games to use that controller instead of mouse & keyboard.

The binding I needed to add was this:\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'mouseclick 1' 'keyup Control_L'\"\n    b:10 + Release\n\nIt waits for the thumb button to be released, and then presses control key, performs the mouse click, then releases the control key.\n\nA: For anyone who wants to bind copy and paste actions to mouse buttons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow Seth answer (the one with Step 1, Step 2 and sudo apt-get install xbindkeys xautomation xev)\n\n*Put following lines in your .xbindkeysrc file:\n\n\nThis is for copying:\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key c' 'keyup Control_L'\"\nb:9\n\nThis is for pasting:\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key v' 'keyup Control_L'\"\nb:8\n\n*b:9 means button 9 on the mouse (check button numbers with xev)\n\n\n*It won't work right away, you must reload .xbindkeysrc first or restart your machine.\n\n\nA: You're going to need several applications for this, to install them run\n# Ubuntu 14.04 and newer\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys xautomation x11-utils\n\nor\n# Before Ubuntu 14.04\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys xautomation xev\n\n(xev was merged into x11utils, as of Ubuntu 14.04 or greater)\nStep 1\nYou need to find the button numbers for the buttons on your mouse.  Run xev.  You will see a litle white windows appear, put your mouse in it and press your mouse buttons (it's best to do this one button at a time).  You should get output like this for each button:\nButtonRelease event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\nroot 0x2e9, subw 0x4c00002, time 25804905, (31,28), root:(821,80),\nstate 0x110, button 1, same_screen YES\n\n(note: xev also capture mouse movement so you might need to sift through mouse movement events to find your button events; e.g.: xev -event mouse | grep Button --before-context=1 --after-context=2)\nThis is what is important from that output: button 1.  That tells us that particular button is button one.  I would store this in a .txt file for now.\nStep 2\nCreate the xbindkeys config file using:\nxbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc  \n\nNext we need to add the key/button bindings to the config file.  You can open this file with gedit $HOME/.xbindkeysrc.  This is where the fun begins.  We are going to use xte to set bindings to our buttons.\nTo make a button act as Ctrl we would add:\n\"xte 'key Control_L'\"\nb:1  \n\nThis would bind Ctrl to mouse button one.\nIf you will tell me the button numbers of your buttons and what you want each to do, I will write the script for you.\n\nA: I've been trying to do something similar, and I've come across this page:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=65471\nHopefully it works for mx 620 as well.\n\nA: I have a Logitech MX 500 and wanted to map the lateral keys with Copy and Paste actions (it is very useful).\nI used this guide to understand how to configure the xbindkeysrc file and be able to map the keys.\n\nA: I made a solution that works with Wayland.\nIts here https://github.com/mathportillo/wayland-mouse-mapper\nIt uses evemu to send a device event notice to the kernel, so it's not restricted by Wayland\nA summarized bash script that show how it works is below (most of the commands require root privileges)\nfind your device:\nlibinput list-devices\n\nto directly find your pointer device name use:\nlibinput list-devices | grep pointer -B3 | grep -o '/dev/input/event[1-9]*'\n\nto list your device events use (change event5 to your pointer device name):\nlibinput debug-events --device /dev/input/event5\n\nto bind commands to your device events use:\nwhile read line; do\n    echo ${line} # line represents a command\n    # your code goes here\ndone < <(stdbuf -oL libinput debug-events --device /dev/input/event5 & )\n\nto trigger a mouse event use:\nevemu-event /dev/input/event5 --sync --type EV_KEY --code KEY_PAGEUP --value 1\n\ntype can be other than keystroke, and code can be other than PageUp, value is 1 for pressed and 0 for released\nyes, your mouse can trigger keystrokes, the system will interpret it the same as keyboards, its all just events from event devices.\nA script that merge all the above concepts on a working mapper, that works on Wayland and can be configured as a service to start on system startup, can be found in the git repo above.\n\nA: Scroll up and down with mouse forward and back buttons\nFirst, install the required packages:\n$ sudo apt install x11-utils xbindkeys xautomation\n\nNext, use xev provided by x11-utils to detect the exact button numbers of the back and forward buttons of the mouse.\n$ xev |grep -A2 ButtonPress\n\nFor my wired vertical Anker mouse, back and forward are respectively buttons 8 and 9.\nButtonPress event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x3600001,\n    root 0x1da, subw 0x0, time 1708382, (68,54), root:(939,498),\n    state 0x10, button 8, same_screen YES\n--\nButtonPress event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x3600001,\n    root 0x1da, subw 0x0, time 1711030, (69,48), root:(940,492),\n    state 0x10, button 9, same_screen YES\n\n\nContinue by creating a hidden file named .xbindkeysrc in your home directory with the following contents:\n\"xte 'keydown Down'\"\nb:8\n\n\"xte 'keyup Down'\"\nb:8 + Release\n\n\"xte 'keydown Up'\"\nb:9\n\n\"xte 'keyup Up'\"\nb:9 + Release\n\nThe xte command is provided by the xautomation package.\nFinally, log out and in again from the desktop for these changes to take effect.

I want to take my gvim (or firefox) window and have it go from the left to right monitor (or vice versa) without having to use the mouse.  \nThere must be a good way to do this, does anyone know?\nThank you, your help is very much appreciated!\nRick\nNOTE:  I'm avoiding using the proprietary (and ill-reputed) drivers for my nvidia 8600 GT.  I did that under my first install of 12.04 and lost the ability to rotate the screens (I use both in portrait view) and couldn't get it back again, which forced me to reinstall 12.04.  At this point I'm far enough along in setting things up nicely I don't want to have to reinstall again. \n\nA: \nI want to take my gvim (or firefox) window and have it go from the left to right >monitor (or vice versa) without having to use the mouse.\n\nA bit late to this discussion, I'm afraid, which I found when trying to do exactly this, but I eventually worked out a no-install no-config solution (for Ubuntu 14:10 at least)\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore the window, if it is currently Maximised, with Ctrl-Super-DownArrow\n\n*Alt-Spacebar to the frame menu, then 'm' to Move\n\n*Use arrow keys to move the entire window from one monitor to the other\n\n*Hit Enter to stop keyboard dragging - you can have strange side effects later if you skip this step!\n\n*Ctrl-Super-UpArrow if you want to maximise again \n\n\nA: If you're using Compiz (used with Unity 3D), there is a nifty plugin that does exactly that, and also moves windows to different parts of the monitor, if desired.\nI only know how to set it from CCSM (CompizConfig Settings Manager). You can install CCSM and the compiz plugins by running\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins\nThe CCSM plugin is called \"Put\", and is in the \"Window Management\" section of CCSM.\n\nEnable the \"Put\" plugin by checking it. Next click the \"Put\" plugin. You can set a shortcut key in the \"bindings\" tab for \"Put to Next Output\".  By default, it's disabled, but is easy to set. In this example we've set \"Put to Next Output\" to Super+Right and \"Put to Previous Output\" to Super+Left.\n\nIf you are not familiar with CCSM, you can get it from the standard repository, but be warned... it can be dangerous to play around with certain settings that you don't understand, so be careful.  I've used it a lot over many versions, and can't live without it, but it allows you to chop off your foot if you're not paying attention.  don't be too afraid, but don't think it will protect you from yourself.\nMore info on Compiz: http://wiki.compiz.org/\n\nA: This bash script can do this too,\nhttps://github.com/jc00ke/move-to-next-monitor\ninstall dependencies \nsudo apt-get install xdotool wmctrl\n\nthen\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jc00ke/move-to-next-monitor/master/move-to-next-monitor\nchmod +x move-to-next-monitor\nmv move-to-next-monitor /usr/bin\n\nand then  set a shortcut for it\n", "Q: Problems with Intel Video Resolution on Acer Laptop Wide Display I have an ACER Aspire 5332 laptop which I have just installed Ubuntu 12.04 x64, which is causing some issues with the video display on boot and video resolution.\nFirst and foremost, it will only boot past the purple screen if GRUB has been edited to replace 'quick splash' with 'nomodeset'. Secondly, once it has booted with the the 'nomodeset' option, it does not allow me to change the resolution higher or lower from 1024 x 786.\nIs it OK to use the 'nomodeset' for normal use?

To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate your documents folder as pointed out by others (Usually under\n\\Drive\\Users\\Yourname for Windows 7)\n\n*Right click and choose the    option \"Make Link\" \n\n*A new item will appear in the folder, called \"Link to Document\"\n\n*Move the new link to your Ubuntu home directory. You can rename it if you like.\n\n\nYou can create specific document type links if you like, for example, a \"Windows Pictures\" link in your Ubuntu \"Pictures\" folder, just for your images.\n\nA: Assuming that you are using Wubi.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Home folder by clicking the Folder icon on the Top-Left corner.\n\n*Click on File System on the left panel.\n\n*Then go to the host folder.\nThis is your Windows Drive.  \nIf you are using Windows 7, go to /Users/Username to see your home folder in Windows in Ubuntu.\nOn Windows XP, go to /Documents and Settings/Username to reveal your home folder.  Your Music and Pictures should be present.\nAfter that, copy your personal files to your Ubuntu home folder.\n\nA: Link Ubuntu home folders to corresponding Windows folders\nRead carefully and do at your own risk.\nIf you concentrate on the renaming of the folders, the process will go smoothly.\nYou can match up your Ubuntu home folders to your Windows folders.\nFirstly set to automatically mount the Windows partition on boot, using this guide.\nOnce you have done that, create a shortcut for each of the corresponding folders.\n\nClick the folder, drag and hold the Alt keyboard button.\nDrop it into your Ubuntu home folder and select Link Here.\nRepeat the process.\n\nIgnore the \"Desktop\" and \"Downloads\" folders, because file permissions will cause havoc!\nThis is because you will not be able to execute installation files in those folders if they sit in the Windows folder and you are currently booted in Ubuntu.\nEach link will be named something like \"Link to Documents\". Leave them this way.\nWrite down the following instructions for reference...\nOnce finished, log out of Ubuntu.\nPress Ctrl + Alt + F1 to load into the terminal.\nType your username and password to log in.\nType dir to view the folders and file in your Ubuntu home folder.\nRaname each original corresponding Ubuntu folder, so they are different.\ne.g \"Documents\" to \"Documents Ubuntu\" OR \"Pictures\" to \"Pictures_\", etc.\nBy typing:\n\nmv \"###\" \"### Ubuntu\"\n\nThis is so as to prevent conflict in folder names. Type dir if you are unsure of the state of folders. Type clear to clear the screen for readability.\n\"###\" being the folder name, such as \"Pictures\". Typing sudo at the start of each line is not necessary here because you are already logged in by this point.\nPress Up Arrow to recall the last commands for speed of use.\nOnce done, for each \"Link to ###\" folder, rename it to the original Ubuntu folder name by typing:\n\nmv \"Link to ###\" \"###\"\n\nOnce finished, press Ctrl + Alt + Del to reboot.\nOnce you are logged back in, check those folders are now linked to your Windows folders. You should notice Ubuntu has still assigned the correct icon images to the folders because it has been tricked into thinking they are the original Ubuntu folders.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: They are still on your computer, and Ubuntu is able to access it. Just mount your Windows partition. They are in Users/. Alternatively, you can choose to transfer files from Windows 7 while installing Ubuntu.\n\nA: *\n\n*You can develop a sharing folder and assign that folder in Virtual Box \"Shared Folders\", then enable the folder after booting Ubuntu from \"Shared Folders\" in Devices.\n\n*You can enable \"Drag and Drop\" in Devices.\n", "Q: lower-case 'c' key not working in bash This is a bit of a strange one. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04. It's been working well but today, I ran into a hell of strange phenomenon. I can no longer type a lower-case 'c' in bash. At first I thought it was a misconfiguration for the gnome terminal but I tried both a stock xterm and directly at the console (ctrl+alt+F1) and the issue was the same.\nI can type an upper-case C without any difficulty and I can type lower-case 'c' in any other terminal based program (vim, bash, less, etc.). The lower 'c' also works if I jump into plain old sh.\nI looked at all the configuration files I know of and haven't found anything incriminating in there.

My laptop, ThinkPad R61i, does not have a built-in webcam. If I buy a generic webcam, can I install it on Ubuntu 12.04? I googled around and a blog post said Cheese is one of the best webcam softwares in Ubuntu. Would Cheese and other webcam softwares be able to work with an external webcam?\n\nA: Ubuntu, thanks to the Linux Kernel supports many MANY types of webcam. There is NO need to install any drivers from any CD they come with (Even so if the CD comes just for Windows in almost all cases). You should be fine just connecting it.\nIf you would like to try the webcam out in Ubuntu, it is as easy as connecting it to your PC and then install the program cheese, either from the Software Center or via the terminal by executing the following line: sudo apt-get install cheese. Then just open dash and type cheese, run the cheese program and see how it works out of the box.\nI have tested at least 10 different webcams ranging from Logitech, Sony, Genius, HP and even several Chinese odd ones with names I don't really remember.. \n\n", "Q: Some games don't launch from Unity Whenever I try to start some games from the sidebar, their icon just glows a few times and then stops. I've tried if with the following games and they don't seem to work:\nI have tried: Licity-NG, Supertuxcart, Stellarium, ect.\n\nA: We had a similar issue with our app. Turns out that we use a wrapper to launch it - and it cannot be launched without the wrapper.\nHowever, the icon in the tray is the app's icon, not the launcher's icon.\nRemoving the & from the launcher solved the problem, since now it's the wrapper's icon that we see.\nAs to why it cannot be launched without the wrapper? Seems that the app looks for its config files using a relative path - and the icon in the launcher confuses it; it thinks it's located in the launcher.\nAs to your question: Maybe you can figure out how to add the original icons to the launcher, without launching the apps. (Though you probabaly will then have 2 icons displaying while the app is running.)\n", "Q: Gedit Embedded Terminal Uses Incorrect Palette I've followed the advice to turn off \"use-theme-colors\" and also set a custom background color in my embedded gedit terminal.

But this is not a good solution since\n\n\n*\n\n*login is slower because it seems to wait until the screen brightness is at the level specified by the script. After entering the password I see the screen brightness go down gradually. Only after this is complete (~1 or 2 seconds) does the background disappear and Unity come up. \n\n*The screenbrightness is not remembered but instead redefined at login. So it gets remembered for the first part of the boot, then set to MAX and then again re-set to normal value by the script.

Thanks!\n\nA: With this guide you can save your brightness level on reboot/shutdown and bring it back after system startup. This does not affect system boot up time.\n\nMake a text file in your home directory (or wherever else) to save the brightness level in it. Open up terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T, then enter the following command:\nsudo gedit /home/brightness\n\nSave and exit gedit. Just let it be empty.

In Windows 7, each card is connected to a different monitor, with the NVIDIA doing any \"heavy lifting\". For the life of me I cannot get Ubuntu to recognize the i915, but when logging off or rebooting, the shutdown actually appears on the i915. lshw lists both. I'm running the \"current\" NVIDIA drivers (not the experimental), but Displays calls its monitor a \"Laptop\".\nIs this even possible under Ubuntu? The only things that even looked like potential solutions were for laptop hybrid setups and used Bumblebee, but that doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nA: Unfortunately the correct answer doesn't solve your problem.\nCurrently X.org is not able to split graphics to two different video cards.  A long time ago there used to be a way to do this using Xinerama, however only the proprietary drivers still support Xinerama.  IOW, you can't do this if one of the GPUs is Intel Graphics.\nNow, you can get this to work if you use two NVIDIA cards using -nvidia and Xinerama (or perhaps TwinView).  And maybe two AMD cards using -fglrx.\nHowever, my recommendation would be to buy a new NVIDIA card that has two outputs on it, and connect your two monitors to that.  Then you can run either -nvidia or -nouveau and it should give good performance and be stable.\nOf course, it would be nice if the configuration you're attempting worked.  There are some efforts upstream to rearchitect X to allow it, but this is still in the development stages and may be a year or two.  But if you are looking for something to spend some time on as a hobby and aren't afraid of breaking your system, you could experiment with the upstream codebases and supply them with feedback.\n\nA: You have two options to set the displays:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Nvidia settings\n\n*From the system\n\n\n1.\nOpen NVIDIA X Server Settings, then this allows you to configure both monitors.\n\nHere you can configure the screens step by step.\n2.\nGo to System --> Preferences --> Display then you will see something like this:\n\nNOTE: If you see only one monitor then click on Detect Monitor which should detect all the monitors connected to the system.\n\nAny problems that you have can be solved changing the resolution of the monitor to be compatible.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu App Showdown Allow Inventive Games? Yes, I have an idea I have been toying around with for a game for a long time. But just haven't had a real reason to get it going.

Most likely with the help of the Lunduke forum, and attribution given where needed.\nBut I need to first know if my entry would even be accepted? I plan to have the Load, Save, and New game options, as well as other interesting ones that may come to mind, as the Quicklist requirements. \nSo the only question is, do innovative games scratch an itch?\n\nA: Absolutely, feel free to submit innovative games!\n", "Q: Difference between ~/folder and /home/username/folder when creating a path in /etc/environment I had an executable script on my ubuntu located on ~/project/ directory and I tried to add that path to /etc/environment . So , I edit the path to this PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:~/project/\" . Then , I logout and login back , open the terminal as su and run the command to execute my script on that folder but the result is command not found.\nThen, I change the path in /etc/environment to  PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/home/r0xx4nne/project/\" and voila it works.Now i can run the executable script inside ~/project/ without fail under su command.\nMy question is , what's the difference between ~/project and /home/r0xx4nne/project when it comes in case of creating a path in /etc/environment ?\nWhy it happened to be like this? I am a newbie and I just want to know more . Thanks for any reply .\n\nA: In the shell, ~/project/ is expanded to /home/yourusername/project in most circumstances. This is called tilde expansion.\nIf you put\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:~/project/\n\n(note, without the quotes) in ~/.profile. Your PATH will be set correctly, because ~/.profile is interpreted by a shell when you log in. /etc/environment (and it's user-specific ~/.pam_environment) is not interpreted by a shell. It is read by the pam_env module during login, but it only accepts NAME=VALUE pairs and no expansions (like $var or ~/ or $(command) etc.) will be done on the VALUE.\n\nA: When you login as su, ~ is /root, not /home/<yourusername>.\nOtherwise, both are the same.\nNB: The tilde is expanded by the shell (and not ls) before actually executing the command. For example, if you run sudo ls ~, the command that will be executed is ls /home/<yourusername> and not ls /root. To prevent the shell from expanding the tilde as non-root user, you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*first login as root, then execute the command in the root shell or\n\n*pass the command as argument to a shell, and make the shell run as root:\nsudo bash -c \"ls ~\"\n\n\nA: The tilde stands for the current user's home directory.  It may be yours, or it may be another, depending on when it's used.  If you are not yet logged in, it won't work.\nA related problem is that /etc is not your directory, and is not the place to add your personal paths.  If there were another user, why would he have a path to your home directory?\nThe correct place to modify the path depends on who needs that path:\nOne user only (you) -- $HOME/.profile, where $HOME is /home/username\nAll users except root -- /etc/profile\nroot -- /root/.profile\nSo, to summarize, your path should be set in /home/r0xx4nne/.profile.\n", "Q: Eclipse won't launch in ubuntu 12.04 I've installed eclipse but it won't launch. I tried launching from the app launcher and with the terminal and I keep getting this error:\nAn error has occurred. See the log file /home/kreshendo/.eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_3.7.0_155965261/configuration/1339994725811.log.\n\nI can post the log information if you need it.\n\nA: Did you install Eclipse via the Ubuntu Software Center? Since it's never up to date there, you should donwload it from the Eclipse website. 3.7.2 is the latest, you seem to be running 3.7.0... After having unpacked the data to whatever place you want you can launch it by running the eclipse executable (purple with two gears for an icon). Unfortunately it doesn't really support being added to the launcher that way. You can of course create a desktop shortcut to the eclipse executable.\n\nA: OK, the problem is that Eclipse IDE does not know where the swt library is located.\nYou need to help the software find it. You can see that by going to the log file on the error message.\nHere is what I did to fix it:\nln -s /usr/lib/jni/libswt-* ~/.swt/lib/linux/x86_64/\n\n\nA: Try this command again:\nsudo apt-get install eclipse\n\n\nA: just copy required libraries\nsudo cp /usr/lib/jni/libswt-*3740.so ~/.swt/lib/linux/x86/\n\nworks for me.\n", "Q: How can I easily share the output of a command or a text file with others? I recently asked a question on Ask Ubuntu (or somewhere else), and a comment or answer asks me to paste the contents of some file or the output of a command to troubleshoot my problem.\nHow do I do that?\n\nA: Usually, bash has a utility called \"script\" that creates a sub-terminal that writes to file. For example, if you do:\nscript ask-ubuntu.txt\n\nIt will create a new bash prompt, and all input and output will be stored in the file ask-ubuntu.txt when you exit the sub-shell.\nYou can then obviously copy the contents of the file, or upload the file, wherever you need it.\n\nA: How to easily share all or part of some text file (or the output of a command)\nYou'll paste the file or command output to Ubuntu's \"pastebin\" service, and then allow others to look at it by simply sharing a link, or use it yourself to further copy and paste a few lines into your question.\n\nNote: If your problem involves the Software Center, Update Manager or apt-get not working, you may have to use the Alternate Method near the bottom of this answer.\n\n1. Start the terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*The terminal allows you to interact with your system by typing commands, instead of using the mouse/cursor. It's not hard to use when you have instructions, and can make some tasks very easy to accomplish.\n\n*Press the Ctrl+Alt+T keys together (at the same time) to start the terminal. This will work for everyone using regular Ubuntu, but if you're using...\n\n\n*\n\n*Lubuntu: Click on the Start button, go to Accessories, and click on LXTerminal\n\n*Xubuntu: Right-click anywhere on the desktop, and click on Open Terminal Here\n\n*Kubuntu: Click on the Start button, type konsole in the Search box, and click on Konsole\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You will get a window with a solid background, showing your username and your computer name, like the below (size/colors may differ!):\n\n\n\n2. Install pastebinit, a small tool to paste text from the terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*In your terminal, type sudo apt-get install pastebinit and press Enter\n\n*Enter your password and press Enter (what you type won't show, don't worry)\n\n*When asked Do you want to continue?, type Y and press Enter, and wait for the prompt (user@machine) to return.\n\n3. Pastebin the file or command and paste its URL on AskUbuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*Go back to your browser, select the exact filename (or command) whose content you were asked to paste, and press Ctrl+C to copy it to the clipboard.\n\n\n*\n\n*A filename may look something like /etc/apt/sources.list, while a command may simply be something like dmesg or grep -i failed /var/log/auth.log. The answer or comment will tell you explicitly if it's a file or a command.\n\n\n*Now, for a file, type pastebinit in the terminal, follow with a space; then right-click on the cursor and click on Paste to paste the filename you copied.\n\n\n*Press Enter, and after a few seconds you will see a link of the form http://paste.ubuntu.com/ as shown below. Move your mouse over it, and it will be underlined -- then right-click and click on Copy Link Address to copy it link to your clipboard:\n\n\n*But for a command, copy and paste the command in the terminal first, and then type\n| pastebinit after it, and press Enter (see screenshot below)\n\n\n*\n\n*The | symbol may be obtained by pressing Shift+\\, which is usually below the Backspace key.\n\n*Move your mouse over the link--it will be underlined--right-click and Copy Link Address as explained above.\n\n4. Paste the link into your AskUbuntu question/comment\n\n\n*\n\n*Go back to your browser, and add a comment (or edit your question) with the Pastebin link - just press Ctrl+V to paste it. Save the edited question or add the comment, and that's it!\n\n\n5. Optional: View your pastebin link, and only paste selected lines from it into your AskUbuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*You can also paste the link into your browser's address bar, or click on the link after you've added/edited it to AskUbuntu, to view it on pastebin. It will look similar to this:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Notice the line numbers. You can also copy and paste selected/requested lines from here directly into your AskUbuntu question.\n\n*Please enclose the pasted lines with the <pre> and </pre> tags as shown below, so that it appears as separate lines in the question instead of being jumbled together:\n\n\nAlternate way to pastebin a file using an editor\nThis may be useful if you are having a problem with Software Center, Update Manager or apt-get and cannot install pastebinit; it only works for files, not commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select and copy the filename from AskUbuntu into your clipboard with Ctrl-C.\n\n*Open a terminal as shown in Step 1 and type gedit, followed by a space, and then right-click to paste the filename as in Step 3 and press Enter\n\n\n*\n\n*Lubuntu users type leafpad instead of gedit; Kubuntu users type kate\n\n\n*The editor will open with the file:\n\n\n*Click anywhere inside the editor window, and press Ctrl+A. All the text should now be highlighted in another color:\n\n\n*Now press Ctrl+C (or the Copy button, if you know where that is) to copy the entire file to the clipboard.\n\n*Go to your browser, and open paste.ubuntu.com. Type your name/nickname in the Poster: box; then click in the Content: box and press Ctrl+V to paste the text you just copied from the editor in there:\n\n\n*Click on the Paste button, and in a few seconds you'll see the text you pasted:\n\n\n*Select the address shown in the address bar (highlighted orange above), copy it with Ctrl+C, and then go back to AskUbuntu and paste it in as explained in Step 4.\n\n*Alternately, select a few lines, copy them and then paste them in AskUbuntu as explained in Step 5.\n\n\nA: If you don't necessarily want to share the output on Pastebin, another option is to use xclip. It takes what you give it on the standard input and puts it optionally in the X selection, or the clipboard.\nFirst, install xclip with this:\nsudo apt-get install xclip\n\nBy default, xclip puts copied text into the x selection instead of the clipboard. Since standard copy and paste functions use the clipboard, we'll have xclip use it too instead of the default. \n\n\n*\n\n*To copy the output of a command to the clipboard:\ncommand | xclip -sel clip\n\n\n*To copy the contents of a file:\nxclip -sel clip < file\n\nTo paste, use the standard shorcut Ctrl+V, or right click and select paste.\n\nA: I needed something to share terminal output even when X server wasn't loaded so I created this service: termbin.com. The only thing you need is netcat, then you can easily share with anyone anything that can be shown in terminal, there's example:\ncat /etc/fstab | nc termbin.com 9999\n\nAfter running this command you'll get in response url address with text file.\nTo make your life easier you can add such alias to your .bashrc file:\necho 'alias tb=\"nc termbin.com 9999\"' >> .bashrc\n\nNow sharing will be much simplier:\nuname -a | tb\n\nYou can get saved ones for example by using curl. You'll find more examples on termbin.com.\nYou can host your own server as well, there is github repository: https://github.com/solusipse/fiche. If you want to make it private, don't forget to set whitelist parameter.\n\nA: I may have missed something in the excellent answers above, but if what you want to copy is relatively small, all you have to do is get it displayed on your screen (e.g. cat filename in a terminal or opening the file in a editor), highlight the desired text with the mouse and copy it into your clipboard.  Once there, you can just paste it into your reply on the web or into an email, etc.\nUsing pastebin or pre tags is important with longer material so that it gets separated out from the rest of the question/answer so that it doesn't distract people from the rest of the post.\n\nA: I may have misunderstood the question, but I've found that in the terminal you can use the following after selecting what needs to be copied with your mouse:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+ Shift+ c     (Copy)\n\n*Ctrl+ Shift+ v     (Paste)\n\n\nObviously once in AskUbuntu or whatever forum with your browser you use your regular Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V. \nThis might be a new addition in 12.04 seeing as I'm a relatively new user and noone else seems to have mentionned it beforehand, but to me this seems an easier and quicker option rather than having to install software or running command lines, especially for relatively new users. Hoping this helps complement Izx's incredibly complete answer.\n\nA: I wonder why no one mentioned this SOLUTION. \nIf you wanted the output to be compiled into a text file you just have to add \" > filename.txt\" ( without quotes) to your terminal command\nexamples\neightnoteight@mr:~$ date > date.txt\neightnoteight@mr:~$ echo yes! it really works with echo too > echotest.txt\n\n", "Q: Where is the information about free space in a disk stored? I am using indicator-multiload and would like it to show the Free Disk Space in my Partitions.\nSo, I went through the code, and found out that the author was parsing the contents of /sys/block/(device)/stat to get the read and write speeds. (where 'device' can be sda etc.).\nI looked around sys/block and couldn't find anything useful that could give me info about free space in a disk. Although /sys/block/sda/size gives the total available space, I couldn't find an entry for free space.\nI want to know if there is a file in the linux system which explicitly stores free space information.\nIf not, can you suggest a way on how I could get an indicator with stats on free disk space.\n\nA: The free space isn't a property of the block device - it's a property of the filesystem on the device. Consequently, there won't be anything useful under /sys/block. Fortunately, there are other ways to query this information.\nFrom the shell, one of the easiest ways to get the current free space is by using df:\n[jk@pecola sda2]$ df -h /dev/sda[123]\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1        64M  117K   64M   1% /boot/efi\n/dev/sda2        20G  9.7G  9.4G  51% /\n/dev/sda3        92G   65G   23G  75% /home\n\nThis uses the statfs system call to determine the free space available; if you're writing code to query free space, I'd suggest reading the statfs manpage:\nman statfs\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: You can find this information using the df command at the terminal (df -H for a more readable output).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 login screen freezes / monitor problems Just bought a new computer and installed Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit version. \nAfter I enter my password, the screen freezes either at the login screen or with the ubuntu 12.04 LTS logo at the bottom. I rebooted with the reset button on my computer and it froze at a purple screen before even going to the login screen.\nI think this is some problem with the graphics, but not 100% certain. When I assembled the computer at my friends house and used his monitor, everything worked just fine. The issue happened when I brought the computer home and used my Acer monitor. The computer has a DVI port and I use a DVI->VGA converter with a VGA cable. \nWhen the login screen does appear, it starts from the middle of the screen and wraps around from the left. I did Ctrl+Alt+F1 and entered the terminal mode. I was able to successfully login from the terminal. So nothing is wrong with my files, maybe something with Unity. I did a \"grep Failed /var/log/xorg.0.log\" and it gave me a \"Failed to load module \"fglrx\". \nI tried to do sudo apt-get install fglrx but that didn't work because it couldn't find any files named fglrx.

I just realized, and I mean it literally just a few minutes ago, that my processor Intel T5870 supports 64-bit. I have had this laptop (ThinkPad R61i) for two years mainly running Ubuntu 32-bit. So far I haven't had a problem with it until last week when my OS (12.04) crashed due to a bad software update (my guess). \nShould I take advantage of my processor's capability and upgrade to 64-bit (and I know I would have to reformat my laptop completely for it) or just let it run with 32-bit without my laptop's performance suffering for using a higher end OS?\nI have a 3.9GB memory, integrated graphics, and 130GB hard drive.\n\nA: Yes. 64-bit is greater than 32-bit on your computer. It is new enough.\n\nA: Yes, you should!  Using the amd64 edition of Ubuntu will allow you to use the full bandwidth of your processor and system bus.  If you need to run 32-bit software on a 64-bit install of Ubuntu, things are easier now that 12.04 supports multi-arch.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: usb drive wiped during install Yeah I tried to install ubuntu on my computer and instead it wiped my USB drive (which has critical files) and now there's ubuntu 'installed' on my USB drive.\nHow do I get my files back?!?!\n\nA: Data recovery tools e.g. Testdisk  can recover data from any medium including an USB stick. \nThe included tool Photorec will recover remnants of individual files but file names and directories will have to be restored manually.\nAnswers to this question may help you finding text files from a phrase they may contain:\nHow to use \"grep\" command to find text including subdirectories\n", "Q: Can I use Ubuntu installed on external HDD on Macbook Air? I have Ubuntu 12.04 installed on external USB hard drive.\nCan I use that same installation (on same USB HDD) on Macbook Air? Can you give me some advices how to boot it?\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: I am familiar with a windows enviroment, when i'm using a a windows computer, I enter the BIOS settings and change the boot sequence so it checks if it can boot from a USB device before it goes to the hard drive.  As i have looked online, apparently, there is no BIOS on a Mac, but there is a program called EFI apparently, where you can change the boot order from the hard drive(or solid state drive) being first to making your external hard drive first.\nThis link is about the boot order changing program, EFI.\nThis link is somewhat about how to use it.\nEDIT: There also was a thing on the apple website that said if you press \"c\" during start up, it will boot from a bootable CD, DVD, or USB drive.

Therefore I would suggest:\nIf you use unity, you could try using unity2d. (At login chose unity 2d)\nIf you don't care about the desktop environment I would suggest something like lxde of xfce (install via Softwarecenter)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lxde\n\nA: A bit harder to install maybe but Enlightenment (E17) is very nice to install. All the eye-candy but it runs quite well on older hardware as well.\nAnd I agree with the writer before me; it's more usefull to install another desktop environment and lxde and xfce are good choices as well.\n\nA: Download and install Compiz Config Settings Manager from Ubuntu Software Settings.\nAfter installing launch CCSM, launch it and go to the Effects category. Here you can turn off various effects and animations such as Desktop Cube, Wobbly Windows, Animations etc.\n\nA: You can log out using Alt+Ctrl+Del and then click \"logout\" .\nThere you can click that Gnome Icon to Change it to Ubuntu 2d Unity or 2d Gnome Desktop.\n", "Q: Is there a way to find out whether an updated program/package lands in the official Ubuntu release repositories? If there is a new release/major update of a program (e.g. Rhythmbox 2.97, Skype 4.0 or Gimp 2.8), is there an easy way to tell whether and when they will make it to the current official Ubuntu release repositories (especially to the LTS release, e.g. Ubuntu 12.04)?\nOr whether it will never be added to the official repositories, so I don't need to wait and just install it through an added PPA/repository?  \nI would like to use the program updates, but preferably when they are well tested and adjusted to the Ubuntu release I use (easily updated by the update manager). But some programs seem to never be added/updated and as I want to stick to the LTS release, I would need to add another repository.\nI know that there are restrictions to what will be updated (Why don't the Ubuntu repositories have the latest versions of software?, StableReleaseUpdates). But for example Firefox and Thunderbird are now regularly updated and Gimp 2.8 might be available in the backports. There is list of pending Ubuntu stable release updates, but I don't find Firefox, Thunderbird (or Gimp) on it, although they are updated.\nI just want to know how to find out whether there is an easy way to know (e.g. one webpage) which programs will be added/updated in the official Ubuntu repositories. Or do we have to ask a question on Askubuntu for every single program?\n\nA: There is no list that covers all yet, especially for possible future updates/upgrades. Maybe somebody can work on this ...\nThat is what I could find out so far:\nIf a program is updated/upgraded, it will be automatically added to the software centre (and will be updated by the system), viewable also with Synaptic (needs install) and apt-cache (command line).\nThe page packages.ubuntu.com shows past updates, but do not inform what the future will hold.  \nStable Release Update/Backport\nEvery SRU (Stable Release Update) and Backport is manually requested. SRUs are done only to fix an important bug. Backports are done upon request, if volunteers and resources are available.\nRequests for packaging and/or backports are generally tracked as bugs. They are not really bugs, of course. But bug trackers usually track more than just bugs, see backports list.\nIf you poke around in Launchpad, you should quickly find the similar tracking lists for the Packaging Team, the Security Team, and the SRU Team.\nThere is doubt that tentative release dates are realistic for most packages, since many backporters seem to work more-or-less at random from the list. If some backporter has specific interests, then they could certainly post ETA dates in the comments and assign the package to themself.\nPPAs and alternative repositories\nAs there are not many significant updates/upgrades that are added in the official repositories of a Ubuntu release (although this might change with future LTS releases), PPAs and alternative repositories are chosen by a lot of people, but it takes time to find them:\nI would also promote a list of PPAs and alternative repositories, but this is not supported by Canonical as many PPAs and alternative repositories can cause problems to a system. But a list with the possibility of rating and comments (problem, success) would be better as the scattered information without or little feedback from the community. Unfortunately the Ubuntu brainstorm page will be closed, so I add this idea to this answer, perhaps somebody knowledgeable reads it and can work on it.\nThere is a related brainstorm idea regarding this topic as long as Ubuntu Brainstorm exists.\n\nA: There is no easy well to tell. But generally the answer is a simple no - major updates will not land in the repositories of an already released Ubuntu version.\nThree notable exceptions to this are Firefox, Thunderbird and Chromium. The reason for this is that these have 'rapid release' schedules (new versions every few weeks). It would not be practical for the Ubuntu security team to continually backport security fixes to older versions. \n\nA: I've been wondering this too, but haven't figured it out yet.  I suspect the answer may be found at http://packages.ubuntu.com/, particularly these two:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/precise\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/precise-updates\nBut not sure yet.\nIn the meantime, I suggest using Debian/Ubuntu's excellent update-alternatives tool to manage the latest versions of software.  It provides the best of both worlds between repo/PPA and manual installation.  \nHere's an example of how to use it to install Haskell, but the general idea should work for any package.  In a nutshell, download the zip/tar archive of the software you want to install, extract it to /opt, then use update-alternatives to soft-link its binaries to /usr/bin.  Voila, you're good to go.\nI like this method even better than repo, PPA, or dpkg, because it lets keep you the entire package in its own compact directory structure, say /opt/firefox, instead of spreading its binaries all throughout /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/share, etc.  Kind of like Gobo Linux's file system.  \nIt also lets you install multiple versions side-by-side and make only one active at a time, and makes it easy to update to a new version or rollback to the old version if there's a problem with the new.  More explanation of that at the Haskell link above.\nAnyway, will update if I figure it out.\n\nA: rmadison queries the archive database for several different Ubuntu releases including the latest development release which has not been officially released yet, as shown in the below example.\nOpen the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install devscripts  \nrmadison <package-name> # replace <package-name> with the name of the package  \n\nExample\n$ rmadison wireshark\n wireshark | 1.6.7-1                                  | precise/universe         | source, amd64, armel, armhf, i386, powerpc\n wireshark | 1.10.6-1                                 | trusty/universe          | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el\n wireshark | 1.12.1+g01b65bf-4+deb8u11ubuntu0.14.04.1 | trusty-security/universe | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el\n wireshark | 1.12.1+g01b65bf-4+deb8u11ubuntu0.14.04.1 | trusty-updates/universe  | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el\n wireshark | 2.0.2+ga16e22e-1                         | xenial/universe          | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el, s390x\n wireshark | 2.2.6+g32dac6a-2ubuntu0.16.04            | xenial-security/universe | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el, s390x\n wireshark | 2.2.6+g32dac6a-2ubuntu0.16.04            | xenial-updates/universe  | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el, s390x\n wireshark | 2.4.2-1                                  | artful/universe          | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, ppc64el, s390x\n wireshark | 2.4.5-1                                  | bionic/universe          | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, ppc64el, s390x\n wireshark | 2.4.6-1                                  | cosmic/universe          | source, amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, ppc64el, s390x\nThese results are all packages from the official Ubuntu repositories of the Ubuntu versions which are listed in the third column of the example rmadison results.

I have tried booting and holding down \"c\" or using \"Option\" and then selecting the OSX install media but after selecting the OSX media the grub menu loads and tried to boot Ubuntu instead of booting off the DVD.\nI tried booting off my Ubuntu LiveUSB and removing all of the partitions using gparted but the problem still persists.  Any ideas?  I just want to wipe everything and go back to OSX only.  When I installed Ubuntu I pretty much followed the default options.\nThanks.\n\nA: Finally got it.\nI was able to boot into internet recovery mode (by pressing Command-R).  I deleted all the partitions and created a new one.  The problem still persisted, I couldn't boot off the OSX DVD.  Then I booted into internet recovery mode again, changed the partition type from MBR to GUID (I think this is what fixed my problem), and re-installed OSX from internet recovery (which took about 10 hours to download) and now everything is back to normal.\nThanks.\n\nA: Are you sure you are selecting the CD/DVD and not the Hard Drive (media) instead ?\nInsert the Mac OSX CD into your CD Drive.\nNow when your computer starts, hold the Alt/Option key. Select the boot CD.\nYou may also have to repartition/format your Hard Drive (because Ubuntu uses ext4) before you install Mac OSX.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot MacBook Pro\n\n*Hold ALT/Option\n\n*Should give you a menu where you can choose what to boot off\n\n*Make sure you select the OSX disk\n\n*It should boot into install\n\n\n---------------Alternative--------------------------\nIf you have a backup of OSX install, boot from USB hard drive into that? Did you ever take any backups with carbon cloner? This creates an exact image of your install on USB hard drive. It will allow you boot into the live USB disk. From there you can restore your hard disk. As mentioned above you may need to partition/format it to journalled again.  \nWhen installing Linux on a MacBook I would never go ahead without taking a live carbon cloner backup. Other than either of these I don't see any other way of getting OSX back on \n( Having bricked an old 13 inch myself....NOT FUN. ) \nBill\n", "Q: How do I make changes to /proc/acpi/wakeup permanent?

I solved the problem by changing the settings in /proc/acpi/wakeup, as suggested in this question: How do I prevent immediate wake up from suspend and/or hibernation?.\nAfter changing the settings, the system goes flawlessly into suspend and stays suspended, but after I wake it back up, the settings in /proc/acpi/wakeup are different from what I set them to.\nBefore going to suspend:\ncat /proc/acpi/wakeup\nDevice  S-state   Status   Sysfs node\nSMB0      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:03.2\nPBB0      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:09.0\nHDAC      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:08.0\nXVR0      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:0c.0\nXVR1      S4    *disabled  \nP0P5      S4    *disabled  \nP0P6      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:15.0\nGLAN      S4    *enabled   pci:0000:03:00.0\nP0P7      S4    *disabled  pci:0000:00:16.0\nP0P8      S4    *disabled  \nP0P9      S4    *disabled  \nUSB0      S3    *disabled  pci:0000:00:04.0\nUSB2      S3    *disabled  pci:0000:00:04.1\nUS15      S3    *disabled  pci:0000:00:06.0\nUS12      S3    *disabled  pci:0000:00:06.1\nPWRB      S4    *enabled   \nSLPB      S4    *enabled\n\nI tell the system to suspend, and it works as it should.

You may google \"Creating a systemd service\" and follow the instructions, but note that redirecting output to /proc/acpi/wakeup is tricky. To get it to work correctly, you must do something like:\n/bin/sh -c '/bin/echo XHC > /proc/acpi/wakeup'\n\nExample output for the service file (e.g., /etc/systemd/system/suspendfix.service):\n[Unit]\nDescription=fix to prevent system from waking immediately after suspend\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/bin/echo XHC > /proc/acpi/wakeup'\nType=oneshot\nRemainAfterExit=yes\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nOr here in this gist\n\nA: The preferred way to do this is by creating a service with systemd.\nAdding script in rc.local is the deprecated way.\n\n*\n\n*Create a script file wherever you wish. Ex: ~/scripts/disable-devices-as-wakeup.sh.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndeclare -a devices=(USB0 USB2 US12 US15) # <-- Add your entries here\nfor device in \"${devices[@]}\"; do\n    if grep -qw ^$device.*enabled /proc/acpi/wakeup; then\n        sudo sh -c \"echo $device > /proc/acpi/wakeup\"\n    fi\ndone\n\n\n\n*Test it by executing it from the terminal.\n\n\n*If everything is okay then let's make a service.\n$ touch ~/scripts/disable-devices-as-wakeup.service\n\n~/scripts/disable-devices-as-wakeup.service -\n[Unit]\nDescription=Disable devices as wakeup\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/home/username/scripts/disable-devices-as-wakeup.sh\nType=oneshot\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n\n\n*Copy or move the service to /etc/systemd/system/.\n\n$ sudo cp ~/scripts/disable-devices-as-wakeup.service /etc/systemd/system/\n\n\n\n*Enable the service.\n\n$ systemctl enable disable-devices-as-wakeup.service\n\n\n\n*Restart the OS and check the status.\n\n$ systemctl status disable-devices-as-wakeup.service\n\nDetailed explanation found on https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/chap-managing_services_with_systemd\n\nA: I ran into this problem again on Ubuntu 12.10. The suggestions from user MTS unfortunately also did not work for me. However, you can write a script to automatically set the usb properties in /proc/acpi/wakeup right before every suspend. \nThe solution is based on creating a suspend hook (based on this Archwiki article). Save the following as /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/45fixusbwakeup, and make sure to make it executable (chmod +x /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/45fixusbwakeup).\n#!/bin/bash\ncase $1 in\n    hibernate)\n            echo \"Going to suspend to disk!\"\n            ;;\n    suspend)\n            echo \"Fixing acpi settings.\"\n            for usb in `cat /proc/acpi/wakeup | grep USB | cut -f1`;\n            do\n                    state=`cat /proc/acpi/wakeup | grep $usb | cut -f3 | cut -d' ' -f1 | tr -d '*'`\n                    echo \"device = $usb, state = $state\"\n                    if [ \"$state\" == \"enabled\" ]\n                    then\n                            echo $usb > /proc/acpi/wakeup\n                    fi\n            done\n            echo \"Suspending to RAM.\"\n            ;;\n    thaw)\n            echo \"Suspend to disk is now over!\"\n            ;;\n    resume)\n            echo \"We are now resuming.\"\n            ;;\n    *)\n            echo \"Somebody is callin me totally wrong.\"\n            ;;\nesac\n\nWhat this does is change the status of every USB device that is currently enabled to disabled. If you only want to change specific USB devices, change the for loop in the script. For example to change only USB1 and USB3 change\nfor usb in `cat /proc/acpi/wakeup | grep USB | cut -f1`;\n\nto\nfor usb in 'USB1' 'USB3';\n\nHopefully this helps someone else who has the same problem. This approach solved the issue for me.\n\nA: Perhaps http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=121158 will help?\nThis is what it says:\n\nFor those who are updating to the 3.2 kernel (which should be everyone due to the recent root exploit), you'll notice your USB wakeup is probably broken. They changed the default wakeup policy (http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-usb/msg53661.html), so you'll need to make a couple of changes:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*you no longer need to enable wakeup in /proc/acpi/wakeup, it's enabled by default\n  \n*you need to enable wakeup for the USB hub in addition to the device in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/wakeup\nSo, this:\necho USB1 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\necho enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-1/power/wakeup\n\nBecomes:\necho enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb3/power/wakeup\necho enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-1/power/wakeup\n\nHopefully this saves others from troubleshooting the same problem. \n\n", "Q: Make Ubuntu fonts sharper In the last two months I'm trying to do a complete transition from Windows 7 to Ubuntu.\nThere is something that is really missing.

I'm using both via dual-boot mode. I've no heating problem with MS Win 7 and the fan speed is normal even with long run utilization. However, when booting with Ubuntu and after short time, the PC got very hot and the fan was running at max speed. I installed a tool called Jupiter, I put it in \"Power Saving\" mode but no result.\nNow, I avoid using ubuntu because I fear it'll damage my all new notebook.\n\nA: There can be many causes for overheating. The most common of which is Heatsink clogging. \nComputer's heatsink can get clogged with dust and dirt. You may have to clean the heatsink of your computer. \nThis can be done by blowing into the heatsink vent with compressed air or simply with your mouth. \nThe other more comprehensive method is to completely dismantle your laptop and physically clean your heatsink. \nThe procedure for cleaning varies from computer to computer and you can get it done from a Hardware guy if you are not confident of doing it yourself.\nYou can also consider buying a Cooling Pad ($10-$30) which can keep your computer cool. \nHeating is also affected by the level of usage. Playing demanding games and using graphics editing software for extended time can generate greater levels of heat.\n\nA: It might also be caused by the driver you're using for your graphics card.\nMy notebook has a ATI mobility card and if I use the wrong driver, the fan's constantly on at high speed (+ more heat and high battery dry for the obvious reasons).\nSo if you have a notebook with ATI card, this might be your issue: look for a better driver. (And don't use the \"Post-release\" driver offered by restricted-driver toolkit)\n\nA: I often blow air through my laptop, and use a cooling pad, so I've upvoted upapilot's answer.\nSome BIOS's supply incorrect or incomplete ACPI information, so you might try to get the BIOS handle the cooling itself. You do this with by editing /etc/default/grub and adding acpi=off to the line GRUB_CMDLINELINUX_DEFAULT between the quotes. Then run\nsudo update-grub\n\nIt would be best to test this with an Ubuntu install CD first as it may make your system unbootable rather than resolving the problem. Booting Ubuntu from CD gives you an easy way to make this and several other settings when it boots Ubuntu from the CD.\nYou may also be able to interrupt GRUB when it presents its menu and select Ubuntu and press e for edit. Then add acpi=off at the end of the linux line. This adds the parameter just for that boot attempt. If it helps you can change it more permanently as above.\n\nA: Try installing the cpu frequency indicator:\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\nThis will install an icon in the appmenu, here you can click and toggle your CPU to more conservative settings; see if this helps.\nIf there is no improvement, maybe check out this resource:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagement\nFor example \"Indicator-Weather\" is problematic because it constantly writes to a log file,  stopping the drive from becoming fully idle in power saving mode, causing heat, triggering fans, etc. This is mentioned in the research. Try to find apps that do this and uninstall them.\nGood luck.\n\nA: I Googled 'Ubuntu overheating laptop' and it is a HUGE problem. I fixed mine by installing Jupiter: http://itsfoss.com/install-jupiter-ubuntu-1304/ Keep in mind that this is an performance applet, so set the performance to 'power saving'. An alternative but may also be helpful is TLP found here under 'Improve battery life and reduce overheating' at the link at the end.

I have a brand new Sony Vaio S series laptop.(VPCSA2DGX) It came factory installed with Windows 7 professional Edition 64bit. Runs Intel core i5, 500 GB HDD , 4GB Ram. First I installed ubuntu 11.10 64 bit along side Windows to dual boot. Later,since the problem did not solve, I installed ubuntu 12.04 64bit along side Windows to dual boot. However the problem keeps annoying me.\nProblem:\nWhen running ubuntu 11.10/12.04, the battery lasts only about 1.5 hours. The Fan runs loud and continuously. And there is a lot of heat generated. System monitor shows less than 5% CPU used. My laptop enjoys hybrid graphic and I tried turning off ADM graphic card and keep Intel graphic card on. However I can not get the Fan noise or heat to go away and consequently the battery drain continues. BTW, in windows, the laptop gives 4-5 hours of battery power, Fan is silent and there is no heat problem. Any ideas on how to reduce the fan noise and how to increase battery life in ubuntu 11.10/12.04?\n\nA: This problem could be caused by a overheating bug in the kernel. Try updating your OS to the latest Linux kernel.\nAlso, download Jupiter which allows you to change Linux kernel parameters on the fly.\nJupiter Download site: http://www.jupiterapplet.org/downloads.html\nCheck that you have got the correct drivers for your AMD graphics card. Incorrect or out-of-date graphics cards can cause overheating.\n\nA: Also you can use laptop-mode. Try it: sudo apt-get install laptop-mode\nHere you can find any additional information about powersaving in ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PowerManagement/ReducedPower\n\nA: You can reduce screen brightness with a key combination Fn + F5 (this key combination is for sony E-Series laptop). After reducing the screen brightness now now my battery last for more than 2.5 hrs (before it was 1.5hrs). This is because uses maximum brightness by default.\n", "Q: Adding Play Framework directory to my system path on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, I am very new to the Ubuntu OS and I would need help with it. \nI am trying to install this open source platform called Play Framework, to install it I need to add the installation directory to my system path, the documentation for Play says that I should open a terminal and type export PATH=$PATH:/to/path/play.

For example, please provide a full description of the errors you are getting.\nIn general, you should be able to fix whatever problem you are having by following the instructions, but make sure you look at the prerequisites.

However, sometimes (not at peak times, but e.g. at 3am in the morning - although backup process start few hours late) the server runs out of RAM. Then it's killing processes and unfortunately it's starting with apache and/or mysqld :-(\nDo I have a chance to define which process is \"important\" or high-priority?\nE.g. i'd define\n1) apache\n2) mysql\n3) postfix\n4) convert\n5) mongod <- as far as i know, mongod is very polite and will release ram for other applications if needed.\nBtw. the system is not running out of memory because of ghost processes; i use some cleaner scripts which make sure that unused ram is recycled :-)\nThx\n\nA: This is behavior determined by the kernel.  When the kernel runs out of memory, it reacts poorly and kills the process using the most amount of memory.  On the desktop, this can sometimes be the xserver, another poor choice to kill first.  This shouldn't happen with adequate swap.\nIf your strategy was to go without a swap file in order to force the OS to use RAM, I suggest you instead have a swap file, and use the swappiness setting to make the OS use primarily RAM.  Find out how to do that here: How do I configure swappiness?\n10 is a typical aggressive value for swappiness.  I found that with values less than 10, the OS seemed to prioritized unloading the swap over the actual running of programs.  In other words, when I ran out of memory, things slowed down immensely.  So maybe start with 10, or something close, and see how well it uses the RAM.\n\nA: Well, in System Monitor you can simply assign a priority via right-clicking a process and choosing change priority. If you don't have a GUI running, you should use the command renice, just check out the manpage.\n", "Q: How to run an application in /opt?

I just updated my linux computer from 64-bit ubuntu 10.04 to 64-bit ubuntu 12.04.  On that bar along the top of the screen in 10.04 are 8 little icons that display the current speed of each of the 8 cores in my CPU (AMD FX-8150).  And I can right-click on them and change various settings, like the current core-speed policy for each core.  Another applet displays 6 similar-style icons that display the current temperature of GPU, CPU, motherboard, HDDs, etc.  These applets are just fantastic!\nNow that I'm running 64-bit ubuntu 12.04, I'm trying to get my desktop set up again, and I have been very unsuccessful at installing or replacing these applets.  I installed the lm-sensors and psensor packages and a few other packages, but typically they just display some large conventional window on the desktop and don't have anywhere near the functionality (and generally don't show all the devices).  I searched, downloaded, installed and tested just about every applet I could find that has anything to do with CPU-core speed and temperatures, but everything is lame, lame, lame in comparison.\nI also downloaded and installed the gnome \"CPU frequency scaling monitor\" applet and the gnome \"hardware sensors applet\".  But they don't appear to do anything when I run them (nothing appears).  If I'm not mistaken, these are the two applets that run on my 10.04 system.\nWhat's the solution?  How can I get those applets to work with 64-bit ubuntu 12.04 ???\n\nLater: A partial answer, but not nearly as convenient as adding applets to ubuntu 12.04 itself.  Execute gnome-panel, remove the top-panel (or move it to the right side of the desktop and make it autohide), add applets to bottom panel (found cpu-core frequency applet, but not temperature applet yet).  The basic process of adding the gnome-panel is at this askubuntu link.\nHowever, that answer is missing some important details.  First, you can't do much of anything with the existing gnome panels unless you hold down the ALT and SUPER key before you right-click the panel you want to remove, configure, add-applets-to, etc.  When you add-applets, you must add 8 of the cpu-frequency applets to display the speed of all 8 cores (or as many applets as you have cores).  After you install as many cpu-core-frequency applets as you have cores in your CPU, you need to right-click each one, then select preferences and specify which core each icon provides information for.  Otherwise you'll have 8 icons all showing the speed of CPU #0 --- not very useful!  I found it more-or-less necessary to make the gnome panels auto-hide (and be mostly transparent and approximately the same color as the desktop).\nThen \"gnome-panel\" must be added to startup applications to make it appear whenever the computer is started.  The gnome-panel settings and whatever applets were added to the panel will be remembered and restarted by the gnome-panel application.\nAnyone who can make these applets work on unity without this hack, please let us know!\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04, you will want to use indicators.  Here are some good ones to replace the functionality that you had before.  :)\nCPUFreq\nThis applet will allow you to scale your processor to its supported frequencies.\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\n\nIf you want to be able to monitor the other aspects of your computer from the panel, have a look at this page on Ask Ubuntu.  There are several indicator here that, when combined, will provide the on demand information you're looking for.\nIn addition to this, you should also try going to the Ubuntu Software Center and searching for indicator.  Ubuntu no longer uses Gnome applets.  So, if you install any Gnome applets on your system, they will be benign.

We will also pull the version of your application in Debian into every new release of Ubuntu at the beginning of the development cycle.\nUbuntu Universe:\nYou can also submit your application package directly to Ubuntu's Universe repository.  This is ideal for Ubuntu-specific application that don't make sense for Debian to have, like ubuntu-tweak.  However, if your application isn't Ubuntu-specific, it's preferred that you get it into Debian eventually.\nUbuntu Developer Portal:\nThis is the newest way to get your applications into USC, it supports both open and closed source apps, both free and for sale.  You will need to signup for an account at http://developer.ubuntu.com and follow the guidelines for publishing your app.  Applications submitted this way can be included into any stable supported release of Ubuntu at any time, but they do have slightly different packaging guidelines you will need to follow.\n", "Q: Why does `cd downloads` fail with \"No such file or directory\"?

I'm trying to install Lubuntu to a USB drive, but I'm having a difficult time installing GRUB to the drive. The rest of the install seems to go fine.\nThis is what I have tried\n\n\n*\n\n*Went through the normal install process. At the end of the process I got an error\n\nExecuting 'grub-install /dev/sdf' failed. This is a fatal error.\n\nIt then prompted me to try to reinstall GRUB or continue without a bootloader. I attempted to reinstall, but this seemed to have no effect as I was left with a non-bootable drive.\n\n*After the normal install failed I tried\nmount /dev/sdf1 /mnt/USB\ngrub-install --force --no-floppy --root-directory=/mnt/USB /dev/sdf\n\nThis gave me an error. I can't remember the exact error at the moment, but I can try to run it again later and edit the question.\n\n*I then ran Boot-Repair and used the advanced options to select \"Reinstall GRUB\" on \"/dev/sdf\". Boot-Repair wouldn't do this on my normal install (I don't know why) and told me I needed to boot into a LiveCD environment.\nI did this and Boot-Repair ran, but gave an error. I don't know why, it simply said, \"Boot-Repair ran with errors.\" Nothing more descriptive than that. Needless to say, I still couldn't boot.\n\n*I finally tried the following\nsudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdf1 /mnt/USB\nsudo mount -t proc none /mnt/USB/proc\nsudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/USB/dev\nsudo chroot /mnt/USB /bin/bash\ngrub-install /dev/sdf\n\nThis gave no errors and seemed to successfully install GRUB to my USB drive. Unfortunately it still doesn't boot.\nWhen I boot from the drive I get a blank screen with a flashing cursor.\nHow can I install GRUB to this disk and get it to successfully boot? Moreover, why is the GRUB install failing in the first place?\n\nA: GRUB install can fail on the USB because its MBR is too small.\nTo install Lubuntu on the USB, I would simply create a persistant live-USB, via UnetBootin or else. This will act as a normal install, and will solve your boot problem because it will use a bootloader that will fit your USB MBR.\n\nA: I would use UNetBootIn in order to make the USB drive bootable with Lubuntu.\nEDIT: From the DamnSmallLinux Wiki\n\"Some users have mentioned that grub-install whines about the --no-floppy argument. Try going without it, try going with it, try using sudo, try unplugging and replacing your USB stick. If your system auto-mounts the USB stick, try it with the stick both mounted and unmounted. You'll probably find a way to make it work.\"\n\nA: Here's how:\n   1. On the live Lubuntu disk open a partition manager (usually called \"disks\" or \"Gparted\").\n\n\n*Now you must format your USB Drive to the MBR/DOS format. Delete any partitions that may remain on the drive. You can do a quick format.\n\n*Create a FAT partition on the drive. The size of it should be at least 500 megabytes. Now do a format (once again, it can be a quick format) and select exFat as the filesystem.\n\n*Now create two more partitions (EXT4 and SWAP) at your desired sizes.\n\n*Run the installer, and at the part where it asks about where to install it, click manual. Select your drive at the top corner, then select each partition and change the usage as shown: exFat to boot partition; swap to SWAP Area; and EXT4 to EXT4 Journaling System.\nIt should install normally now. Hope this helps! Let me know if this doesn't work or you need more detail, as I am very willing to help.\n\nA: I see your problem is genuine. As far as I understand you need a USB drive to use as a portable drive for OS.\nFor that you need to make a live usb from any tool like UnetBootin on one usb, lets say USB1. Then while booting from USB1 on PC add USB2 to your device. Then go for install and choose the USB2 as the partition for installing Lubuntu.\nHope this works out.\n", "Q: How to change project page name?

Cheers to you.\nI got a problem in making a Mobile-BroadBand connection in Ubuntu 11.04, using 'Huawei e303c' usb data-card. I'm using Tata Docomo 3G sim-card (India, circle: Maharastra).\nMy observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed the device's driver 'Mobile-Partner For Linux'(which came up with the device). But it is not detecting my device.\n\n*In Network Manager, Adding a Mobile-BroadBand connection is not able to detect the device (with or without the device's driver installed).\n\n*I tried softwares like usb_modeswitch, gnomeppp, wvdial, sakis3G and followed their guidelines. These too didn't work.\n\n*Without the driver, the system is able to identify the device (Mobile-Partner icon comes-up, that leads to driver setup files). But after installing the driver, nothing comes-up there.\n\n*In all the above cases, when 'lsusb' cmd is fired, the prompt shows the connected data card (as 'DEVICE_ID:VENDOR_ID Huawei Technologies Ltd.,').\nThis is my problem. Give a solution to get my device connected.\n-Umash\n\nA: I encountered the same problem. Earlier the datacard was working fine with Ubuntu 12.04, without installing any software. But as soon as I installed the linux drivers which were bundled with the device, it stopped working.\nAfter a lot of searching, and digging into the install script, I found a simple solution. Run the following commands in the terminal, to get Huawei E303c working again:\nsudo apt-get remove usb-modeswitch usb-modeswitch-data\nsudo apt-get install usb-modeswitch\n\nThese commands will reinstall usb-modeswitch. Actually, the whole problem arises because Huawei drivers modify the usb-modeswitch data files, reinstalling them will solve the issue.\n", "Q: How to make grub stop appearing every time I boot?

And when the software.\nhas been downloaded to run a command like wine npp.6.1.3.Installer.exe /S /Silent\nfor silent installation.\n\nA: The download links are not just any link but are the addresses of apt/debian repositories. If your specific software/program sets one up, you can add it but no, you can't add standard http links. \nIf you try to add them, and Software Sources lets you, that will break installs/updates on your system until you remove it. \n\nA: The Software Sources file can only access Debian repositories and Debian style program installers.  Items on Launchpad, or the other sources you stated in your question are stored in a Debian repository on each location which contains items compatible with apt-get.\nA regular download link, however, cannot be used in the software sources as an updateable item, especially for Windows files.\n", "Q: Integrating Internet Download Manager, which installed in Virtual Box, with Firefox or Chromium, installed on Ubuntu 12.04 (host OS) Maybe my question be kind of strange but i hope i can get a good answer.\nI have installed Win XP on virtual box in ubuntu 12.04, and I installed IDM on it.\nSo, I want when i clicked on a downloadable link in Ubuntu (the host OS), the IDM can grab the link and download it in Win XP (the guest os)!\nBefore that I wanna thank you.\n\nA: I used to use IDM on XP.  I really doubt if it will work from a VM, as the VM is pretty separated from the host system.  \nIf you use Firefox, I'd recommend trying out \"DownThemAll!\", a download manager plugin.  I've been using it, and it works very well for me.  You can download all links on a page, or a selection of links, like IDM.  It seems fast, and so far, has worked well for me.\nI don't know if it's available for any other browsers, though.\n\nA: Try sharing your downloads folder with your virtual machine.  Point IDM at this folder.  This way you can download with one browser and have your downloads in one place between machines.\nGood luck.\n\nA: It seems impossible.\nThis is not an answer, but I'm encouraging you to take the advantage of ProzGUI, FlashGot and Video Download Helper on Firefox as an alternative to Internet Download Manager.\nI'm working on something like this:\n\nYou can also try other downloaders like FatRat, MultiGet, WxDownload Fast instead of ProzGUI\n", "Q: Command-line to list DNS servers used by my system Is there a command to list dns servers used by my system?\nI tried \n$ cat /etc/resolv.conf \n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\n$ cat /etc/network/interfaces \n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nBut it doesn't list any servers, if I go to \"Network Manager GUI Tool\", in Wireless section it lists \"DNS 192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\"\nCan I get same information from command line?\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\nA: This is valid for Ubuntu 13.10 and earlier.

Which it is - on desktop machines most of the time at least. But the fuller answer is that sometimes network-manager is not in control. E.g. vpnc messes with /etc/resolv.conf directly.\nSo: First check if 127.0.0.1/localhost is used. This could be done with dig:\n> dig something.unknown  | grep SERVER:\n;; SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1)\n\nNow you know that we are using localhost. Go ahead with one of the popular answers. I like:\n> nm-tool | grep DNS:\n    DNS:             8.8.8.8\n\nBut if 127.0.0.1/localhost is not used, then nm-tool's and nmcli's output will be misleading:\n> dig something.unknown  | grep SERVER:\n;; SERVER: 172.22.216.251#53(172.22.216.251)\n> nm-tool | grep DNS:\n    DNS:             8.8.8.8\n\nHere, dig is correct and nm-tool's information is misleading. In reality addresses local to the environment I've VPN-ed into are resolved correctly. All of which Google's DNS 8.8.8.8 doesn't know about.\nThis is because after connecting to a VPN with vpnc, it puts a line in /etc/resolv.conf so it looks like:\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 1.2.3.4\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\nsearch MyDomain\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 20.04, if your resolve.conf points to loopback:\n$ sudo cat /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf\nnameserver 127.0.0.53\noptions edns0 trust-ad\n\nand:\n$ ss -plnt | grep ':53'\nLISTEN   0        4096            127.0.0.53%lo:53               0.0.0.0:*    \n\nyou can use resolvectl to show status for interfaces:\n$ resolvectl status\n\nGlobal\nLLMNR setting: no                  \nMulticastDNS setting: no                  \n  DNSOverTLS setting: no                  \n      DNSSEC setting: no                  \n    DNSSEC supported: no                  \n          DNSSEC NTA: 10.in-addr.arpa\n....\n\nLink 4 (wlo1)\n      Current Scopes: DNS           \nDefaultRoute setting: yes           \n       LLMNR setting: yes           \nMulticastDNS setting: no            \n  DNSOverTLS setting: no            \n      DNSSEC setting: no            \n    DNSSEC supported: no            \n  Current DNS Server: 10.128.128.128\n         DNS Servers: 10.128.128.128\n          DNS Domain: ~.\n\n\nA: Amazing how many ways there are to do it. On an Ubuntu Server 18.04, if you don't want to install anything extra like nm-tool, then systemd-resolve --status will work out of the box for DNS information.\nIf you're interested getting not only your DNS servers, but also default gateway, IP address, network mask, etc, then netplan ip leases eth0 will give you all that information in an easy-to-read form (assuming you're interested in the eth0 interface).\n\nA: cat /etc/resolv.conf should show your DNS servers.\nYou may not modify the resolv.conf directly with Ubuntu 12.04. If you need to change them though, you can add new DNS servers in your \n/etc/network/interfaces file by adding the following:\n dns-nameservers x.x.x.x x.x.x.x\n\nwhere x is the DNS servers you wish to use.\nIf I were you, I would uninstall network-manager. In my opinion it's a pile of crap.\nYou can accomplish everything you need to do manually without worrying about changing your settings, especially if you have multiple NICs on the computer.\n\nA: resolv.conf isn't really used anymore, unless you implement it yourself.  The network manager does it now.  I created an alias to list the DNS servers on my system, as I sometimes switch from OpenDNS to Google's open DNS.\nUbuntu >= 15\nnmcli device show <interfacename> | grep IP4.DNS\n\nUbuntu <= 14\nnmcli dev list iface <interfacename> | grep IP4\n\nIn my case, <interfacename> is eth0, which is common, but not always the case.\nSee if this is what you want.\nEDIT: \nI think resolv.conf is actually used indirectly, because the network manager creates the server that listens on 127.0.0.1, but I was told that this is an implementation detail that should not be counted on.  I think that if you enter DNS addresses before this entry, they might get used, but I'm not sure exactly how this works.  I think it's best to use the network manager in most cases, when possible.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04\nsystemd-resolve --status | grep -B 9 -A 6 \"Current DNS Server\"\n\ngave me a clear result as to what DNS was in use for each adapter using DNS.\nTo reconfigure DNS\nman systemd-resolved\n\nreveals the DNS servers contacted are determined by global settings in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.\nSudo edit that file and uncomment and set DNS= and FallbackDNS= to the IPv4 DNS servers you want.\nFor example, DNS=8.8.8.8 and FallbackDNS=8.8.4.4 would use Google Public DNS.\nRestart the machine to apply the change.\n@PLA, thank you for this answer which led me down this path.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 15.10 you can get DNS\nnmcli device show <interface name> \n\n\nA: On systems where systemd-resolved is NOT installed :\n$ host -v something.unknown | awk -F \"[ #]\" '/Received /{print$5}' | uniq\n192.168.1.1\n\nOn systems where NetworkManager is running :\n$ ( nmcli -f IP4.DNS,IP6.DNS dev list || nmcli -f IP4.DNS,IP6.DNS dev show ) 2>/dev/null | awk '/DNS/{print$NF}'\n192.168.1.1\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 you can use systemd-resolve --status.\nIn newer versions use resolvectl status.\n\nA: nmcli version 0.9.10\nYou can use either of these commands:\nnmcli -t -f IP4.DNS device show eth0\nIP4.DNS[1]:192.168.1.1\nIP4.DNS[2]:8.8.8.8\n\nnmcli -t -f IP4.DNS connection show conn-name\nIP4.DNS[1]:192.168.1.1\nIP4.DNS[2]:8.8.8.8\n\n\nA: Seems to be managed by network manager.

The easiest way is to boot from your Ubuntu Live CD or USB device.  \nOnce the Ubuntu desktop has loaded, start Disk Utility (gparted).  \nNext, find your Ubuntu partion(s) and format them all as free space.  Next, resize your Windows partition (NTFS) to consume the rest of the disk.  Accept the operations and wait for a few moments.\nThat's it!\nGood luck.  :)\n\nA: You could try to format it with an Ubuntu live CD.\n\nA: Ok, I solved.\nThe problem was that I tried with a live CD of Ubuntu 10.04. After a lot of workarounds (for instance, I can boot from the live distro only if there are both CD and USB plugged in!), I solved using the Ubuntu 12.04 live CD, and gParted.\nThank you to everyone who wanted to help me!\n\nA: OS-Uninstaller is a small graphical tool to perform a clean and quick uninstall of any operating system (Windows, OS X, MacOS, Ubuntu, other Linux distributions...) from your computer.\nFeatures\n\n*\n\n*It supports removing only selected OS boot list entries in the GRUB.\n\n\n\n*Or completely remove the GRUB and replace it with the original MBR (master boot record) that was there before installing Ubuntu.\n\n\n*It also automatically reformats the partition of the OS that you just removed into NTFS (default) or ext4, depending on the OS that was there before.\n\n\n*Change the GRUB menu’s display timeout.\n\n\n*Backup the partition table and the boot sectors (just in case).\n\n\n*It also lets you manually change the MBR and its installed location of hard disk and the partition it’s linking for booting. But for most users, you don't have to tweak any of these.\nDownload Boot-Repair-Disk. Then create a live USB flash drive of it.\nIn order to make a Boot-Repair live USB, use UNetbootin. The flash drive you use should be 1GB or larger and formatted to FAT32. The formatting procedure will delete all of the files that are already on the flash drive.\nIn UNetbootin click the Diskimage radio button and then click the   ...   button.\n\nSelect the boot-repair-disk ISO file that you downloaded and click the Open button.\nIt is very important to verify that the device that you are installing the boot-repair-disk ISO to is indeed your flash drive, so that you don't overwrite any of your system or personal files which may make your operating system unbootable. In OS X you can find the device name of the USB flash drive using Disk Utility.\nIn the first screenshot the name of the USB drive is /dev/disk0s4\nTo boot the Boot Repair live USB on a Mac:\n\n*\n\n*Insert the USB drive into an available USB port.\n\n*Reboot or turn on the Mac.\n\n*Immediately after the startup chime, press the Option key (sometimes marked Alt).\n\n*Select the USB drive from which to boot by using the left and right arrow and Enter keys.\n\nBoot from the Boot Repair live USB. A window (Boot-Repair) will appear, close it. Then launch OS-Uninstaller from the bottom left menu.\n", "Q: cmake fails with \"CMake Error: your CXX compiler: \"CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND\" was not found.\" jonquil@jonquil-Satellite-L755D:~/Downloads/akonadi-googledata-1.2.0/build$ cmake ..\n-- The C compiler identification is GNU\n-- The CXX compiler identification is unknown\n-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc\n-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc -- works\n-- Detecting C compiler ABI info\n-- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done\nCMake Error: your CXX compiler: \"CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND\" was not found.

I would prefer to dual boot it, given that my hard drive has so much space.\nUpdate: So does this mean that even if I have Ubuntu installed, that my data would still be at risk due to, say, stability issues?\n\nA: It's actually very much possible. There is always a risk of loosing data, so back up first. But it worked well for me. I wrote an extensive guide here. The trickiest part is the work with EFI, since Macs don't have a BIOS. Be sure to check compatibility with your Hardware.\n\nA: If you want to have the best performance, you will want to dual-boot your machine and use an internal hard disk.\nIt's not dangerous to install Ubuntu, simply because it doesn't have the ability to hose your hardware, but it can be dangerous to your important data if you don't know what you're doing.\nThe Ubuntu installer should guide you through partitioning very easily, but it would be wise for you to back your data up first.\n", "Q: how can I send file to playbook via USB?

Booted from live CD, opened terminal and typed:\nsudo update-grub\n\nBut got the message returned \nsudo: can't stat /etc/sudoers: Input/output error\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\n\nTried without sudo, it told me I had to be root to do it.\n\nA: There must be some error with the liveCD.  As suggested by @psusi, you should check the disk.  If there's an error, you may want to replace it before using it for anything else.  And it's a good idea to check the ISO before burning.\nOriginally, I had thought that sudo was not required since there's no password, but I found that this is not the case.  Programs like gparted, that normally prompt for a password, will run from the menu without prompting; but commandline programs still require sudo, although they don't prompt for a password.\nBut you should be aware that update-grub would not be the correct method to fix this in any case; it simply generates the menu configuration file (/boot/grub/grub.cfg) in the partition that the GRUB MBR code reads (in this case, the CD, which can't even be written).  In your case, the GRUB code is not in the MBR, so it is not being run; therefore, it never reads the menu configuration file. \nWhat you need to use is grub-install to fix your problem, which is a bit more complex, and requires mounting the disk.  It may be easier for you to use the boot repair disk  .  This disk will automatically fix this problem.\nIn order to actually put GRUB on the MBR, you need to run grub-install, specifying which directory to use for grub.cfg (it will default to /boot/grub/grub.cfg), and specifying the disk for the MBR code, such as sudo grub-install --root-directory = /media/sda2 /dev/sda; assuming /dev/sda2 is mounted at /media.  The main point is that the partition must be mounted to have grub.cfg installed.  \nThe syntax for grub-install is basically:\nsudo grub-install < mounted location of grub.cfg > < name of disk MBR for GRUB itself >\nSo, in my example it assumes /dev/sda2 is mounted at /media/sda2, and will put grub.cfg in /media/sda2/boot/grub.\n\nA: It seems that your cd is damaged.  You can run the disc check at the boot menu to confirm.\n", "Q: Should I install the recommendations apt-get gives me when installing vim? I installed the text-editor \"VIM\" on my Ubuntu desktop 12.04 (running as a guest vm on a Win 7 host via VirtualBox). I used the command \"sudo apt-get install vim\", and the following \"recommended additions\" came up:\nctags vim-doc vim-scripts\n\nI am still relatively new to Linux and am learning the basic commands, so I have little to no idea what these recommended additions are or if I should download them. I mostly downloaded VIM as a practice for the \"apt-get\" command. \nAlso, upon starting VIM up (sudo VIM), I can go into insert mode via pressing 'a' and escape insert mode via pressing 'esc', but beyond that, I don't know how to quit VIM (asides from forcing the terminal to close by manually x'ing out of it) or how to save changes I've made. For example, I have a word doc saved in /home/documents/VMtext.odt \nDoes it make sense to use the command sudo VIM /home/documents/VMtext.odt to edit the word doc through VIM, as opposed to just opening the word doc and editing it directly?\n\nA: Not exactly sure what those extra files are but just install them they could be part of some dependancy. Quickly overview of vim bellow:\nTo quit INSERT MODE press Esc button.\nTo save and quit press:\n:wq\n\nw for write, q for quit.\nTo quit without saving changes press:\n:q\n\nIf vim complains after this command press:\n:q!\n\n! is for force quit\nThis video explains a lot about vim - http://youtu.be/ImK_dHPOTIE\n\nA: You can ignore them for now if you just want to use the basic functionality of vim.\nIf you're new to Linux, I'd leave vi/vim alone for now.  There's easily 100 different functions you can do... depending on which key combo's you press.  To get started using something simpler as an editor, e.g. on Ubuntu you can use gedit which is a bit like Windows notepad.\nIf you just want to learn more about apt you can find good info here:\nhttp://newbiedoc.sourceforge.net/system/apt-get-intro.html\n\nA: You might consider that \"playing around\" with vim, instead of going to something more comfortable but less functional (like gedit-notepad clone) may also get you flying sooner. While you may be stuck with gedit, afraid to bother with vim/emacs, later on. Just a personal choice to make.\n", "Q: Reset boot-repair options I have boot-repair installed and it was working fine until one day I checked the option \"Purge GRUB before reinstalling it\"  and went ahead and did what it said. But now, I tried to fix the GRUB and was off-line so I couldn't do it. Then I realized that the option \"Purge GRUB before reinstalling it\" is grayed, so I can't uncheck it. I purged boot-repair and reinstalled it but the problem continues. I've been thinking there's probably a configuration file I have to reset or delete so the option is available again.\n\nA: Boot-Repair's \"Purge GRUB\" option can't be unticked if some GRUB executables (eg grub-install) are missing in the system you want to repair.\nThe \"Purge GRUB\" option will download the GRUB packages from Internet and reinstall them.\nIf you need more information, please indicate your BootInfo URL.\n", "Q: How to enable mouse wheel in virtualbox?

The problem that I have is that whenever I log in, conky starts up, as set up in Startup Applications, but the instance it runs is dropping shadow and is above every other window, showing the wallpaper beneath it. This can be easily fixed by relaunching conky, but that defeats the purpose of having it start up at login. Also, running conky at any point manually after logging does not cause this. Any suggestions? I rewrote the script and played about with Compiz, but it still keeps happening.\n\nA: Have you tried using \"conky -p 50\" in Startup Applications?\nIt means there will be a lag of 50 seconds before Conky is actually started and gives all other programs the opportunity to start smoothly before conky is run.\nSolved a lot of issues for me.\nMight be worth to try...\n\nA: I had the same problem. It's caused by conky starting up before the window manager. Most solutions will have you set conky to start 30s after boot.

However even in those cameras where the support of video download and its quality is similar using both protocols the usb2 mode can be used with a special driver mostly available for Windows XP. This implies big problems in Windows Vista, Windows 7, MacOSX, and obviously, and especially in Linux to use this capability. Even finding so-called updated drivers for Windows Vista does not help much since those drivers still work with old video editing software which is only working unfortunately in Windows XP 32 bit and is mostly incompatible with newer Windows versions.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Fails to Boot after Reboot I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on several Dell c6220 servers.

Is it possible to clear this space, or does this happen automatically?\nIn my understanding:\nThe download cache is where program files are downloaded before they are actually installed onto the computer. Once the \"download\" file is \"installed\" then the file in the download cache is no longer needed. Is this correct?\n\nA: When a .deb package is retrieved to be installed (either as a new package or to upgrade the current version), it is stored in /var/cache/apt/archives. These packages are not needed after installation, but if you keep them, and you need to reinstall a package, then it doesn't have to be retrieved again.\nYou can delete these files manually but there is very little reason to do so, as there are better, automatic ways to do it.\nIf you want to delete all of them, run:\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nIf you want to delete just the ones that are quite unlikely to be needed again, run:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nSpecifically, what autoclean does is to delete just the ones that are no longer provided for download. These versions are, generally speaking, sufficiently old and not recommended for use, that you usually won't want to reinstall to them.\nSince the effect of autoclean depends on what packages are available for installation, you may want to update your local information about that first:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nIf you want to delete specific ones, then it would make sense to manually remove the ones you don't want. You can do that with this method, though if you're comfortable with the command line then this would probably be faster, easier, and (since you don't have to worry about a root Nautilus window you might forget to close, or in which you might make a mistake with the mouse) less daunting:\ncd /var/cache/apt/archives\nsudo rm file1 file2 ...\n", "Q: Custom widgets/controls in application indicators I want to develop an app for ubuntu, that integrates inside the calendar indicator/menu.

My password was the same  but when  I entered it for sudo it no longer worked.  I am slightly concerned that I have been hacked, but that would be difficult because two firewalls would have to be compromised, and no one in the household would know how to change a passwd but me, so I am assuming that is not the issue, but I changed both user and root passwds as a precaution. Still not sure as to cause.\nMethod:\n\n*\n\n*alt-ctrl-f2 moves to a console. This does not work in a terminal or via su\n\n*Login as root You need to have root's password, which is not the same as sudo.\n\n*Execute command passwd USERNAME with your user name substituting for 'USERNAME'\n\n*Enter a new password and confirm. Logout.\n\n*alt-ctrl-f7 brings you back to your desktop.\n\n*close all open terminals\n\n*Open a new terminal and test with sudo ls.\n\nThis worked for me anyway.  I was locked out of my account for 8 minutes because of fails, but I think this reset that timer.

Generally people recommend using the jockey-gtk program, which doesn't detect the card and states that there's no propitiatory drivers to install. I tried download the official binary from the NVIDIA site, but that told me that I had to remove the Nouveau kernal driver, so I did that, following the instructions on the wiki (apt-get remove --purge xorg-something or other) and ignoring the \"DON'T DO THIS\" warning, after that didn't do anything i installed various packages (nvidia-common, nvidia-settings, etc) and eventually got the nvidia-settings program (and a very low screen resolution). Unfortunately when I open nvidia-settings it tells me to run nvidia-xconfig as root (i've done this several times, but to no avail) and doesn't let me configure anything. At this point I tried re-running the binary installer i downloaded from nvidia's site, and it said it worked but it didn't change a thing.

It shows that my laptop is always running in Performance mode and never goes to On-Demand shortly after bootup like it did in 11.04. I have to change it manually now.\nI am wondering if Performance is now standard in 12.04 or if the applet is just not working correctly. I honestly cant tell the difference in performance  when I select either one and according to my temperature monitor there is no difference between the two either (Except that in On-Demand the CPU frequency changes between 800 Mhz and 2.27 Ghz) and in Performance it stays constantly at 2.27 Ghz). Powersave does make my laptop run cooler and slower as it stays at 800 Mhz.\nHas anyone else come across this at all?\nThanks much for reading this.\n\nA: The ondemand governor is the default and best for most general use-cases.  Incidentally, I ran some analysis on this for 12.04 to see how the governors shape up on different scenarios:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/power-benchmarking/cpu-governor/results.txt\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/power-benchmarking/cpu-governor/cpu-governors.ods\n\nA: The performance is normally set to ondemand, so it may be an issue with your system specifically, or it may be the way your CPU is set to work by default (a BIOS option most likely).\nAs you don't say what laptop you have, I can't give a detailed answer, but I would suggest checking the BIOS to see if it does not have the CPU set to a high performance mode.\n\nA: Else you can try mercury.

In the end I did the only thing that seemed logical to me be4 reinstalling windows and it worked like a charm.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot into Windows partition, and use the free, non-commercial version of EasyBCD to reinstall the Windows bootloader. \n\n*Reboot and check that you're not using grub anymore. \n\n*Delete the Ubuntu partition and extend the Windows partition using the Windows Disk Management tool.

A lot of guides tell you to change workgroup from the default 'workgroup' to something else, e.g. smb.conf \"workgroup = ubuntu_home\"\nI see the practical reason why some would want there files to be more private by changing the workgroup name; and perhaps have more control of who see's there data; however, by using the default workgroup name it allows other people on the domain to connect to the shares with little effort as most computers are default 'workgroup' \nThe sole purpose of my Ubuntu server is to share files across my network to my roommates' computers and to XBMC. If this is my goal, then is there any real reason to change the default workgroup?\nAm I missing anything? Security? Flexibility? \n\nA: I think the most important thing is to have all of the computers use the same name; it seems to work better that way.  \nIn my experience, there is not a standard.  Windows used to use \"WORKGROUP\" in the old days, but XP seemd to use \"MSHOME\", if I remember correctly, and I don't know what Windows 7 uses - did they go back to \"WORKGROUP\"?\nIt's not that hard to change on either OS, so if all the other computers have one workgroup name, I would use that name as the path of least resistance.\nThe only reason I see to use a unique name is that you know everyone is configured to the same workgroup when you see them all together.\n", "Q: How to write \"o\" with upper-line in Ubuntu?

I go to system settings > keyboard > shortcuts > sound and media and find the Volume Mute setting and enter the second shortcut I want for it. However, this deletes the first shortcut. How can I bind two keys to this function?\n\nA: It is quite easy to do such a thing if you know the command for doing that function.\nIf you are using ALSA sound driver, the commands are :  \namixer set Master mute` for muting the system  \n    \"amixer set Master unmute\" for unmuting the system  \n    \"amixer set Master toggle\" for toggling volume.  \n    \"amixer set Master <vol>\" to set volume level to <vol>\n\nSo, in the Keyboard shortcut option, click on Add and in the Command box, enter the functionality that you want.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: I try install dhcp3-server, but /etc/init.d/dhcp3-server file is missing.

I want to make a partition that is made of ram ...\nExample \nIn windows 7 you can make a partition that is made of ram \n\nI have created 1 GB of partition in ram . using Primo RamDisk \nIs there any good Alternative in Ubuntu ?\n\nA: \nThis will show you how to make a RAMDISK super fast and easily.  With\n  a RAMDISK you can use your memory for temporary space and it’s also a\n  lot quicker than your hard drive.\nNow lets start by using the next 2 commands to make your RAMDISK.\nPut whatever you want your RAMDISK to be called where I wrote\n  “nameme”.\nmkdir -p /media/nameme\n\nmount -t tmpfs -o size=2048M tmpfs /media/nameme/\n\n\nThe above commands would use 2GB of my RAM for the RAMDISK. If you don’t have as much ram as I do I would use 512MB or 1GB. So next were going to create a command for Terminal that will automatically create the RAMDISK for you.\nSource: How To Create A RAMDISK In Linux\n\nA: The tmpfs filesystem is a RAMDISK. The following will create a 2G RAMDISK that will always be available.\nsudo mkdir -p /media/ramdisk\nsudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=2048M tmpfs /media/ramdisk\n\nThe ramdisk folder is owned by root as it is to be available on reboot. The ramdisk permissions should be writeable by everyone. The tmpfs default permissions (chmod 1777) are correct.\nsudo chmod 1777 /media/ramdisk\n\n\ndrwxrwxrwt 2 root root 180 Apr 23 07:34 /media/ramdisk\n\n\nTo make the ramdisk permanently available, add it to /etc/fstab.\ngrep /media/ramdisk /etc/mtab | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\n\nYou will see the line moved from mtab to fstab. It will look something like this.   \n\ntmpfs /media/ramdisk tmpfs rw,size=2048M 0 0\n\n\nThe RAMDISK won't consume memory until you use it. Double check your memory requirements during maximum system load. If the RAMDISK is too large, your system will consume swap storage to make up the difference.\nTo adjust the size of the RAMDISK, edit /etc/fstab and verify by remounting the ramdisk (you will lose your current RAMDISK content as you will on reboot). The following will change the size of the ramdisk to 512M\n# Check the existing ramdisk size.\ndf /media/ramdisk\n# change size=512M for a 512 megabyte ram drive.\nsudo vi /etc/fstab\n# Remount the ramdisk, you will lose any existing content.\nsudo mount -a /media/ramdisk\n# Verify the new ramdisk size.\ndf /media/ramdisk\n\n\nA: Adding my 2-cent for the case you don't have root-privileges:\nQuoting from this answer from unix.stackexchange \n\nLinux provides a tmpfs device which any user can use, /dev/shm. It is\n  not mounted to a specific directory by default, but you can still use\n  it as one.\nSimply create a directory in /dev/shm and then symlink it to wherever\n  you want. You can give the created directory any permissions you\n  choose, so that other users can't access it.\nThis is a RAM backed device, so what's there is in memory by default.\n  You can create any directories you need inside /dev/shm\nNaturally, files placed here will not survive a reboot, and if your\n  machine starts swapping, /dev/shm won't help you.\n\n", "Q: How to fix \"apt-get upgrade\" errors?

I have a Windows 7 right now on my Inspiron Dell Duo. I have done this before; I changed it to Ubuntu when I first got it. I changed it back to a Windows 7 because I didn't adore it as much but I used my bro's laptop for a week which has Ubuntu and I realized I absolutely LOVE it!

If I change it, will the stuff on my computer right now still be there if I change it from Windows 7 to Ubuntu?? I hope that makes sense.. Thank you!! xx\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you want to install Ubuntu to your laptop and keep everything from windows?\nThe easiest way is to multi-boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu. Just install Ubuntu to a flash drive (or Live CD) and boot up from it. You can install it to your hard drive from there, and it gives you an option to install it next to Windows.\nOptionally, you can instead use the Ubuntu Window's installer (also called 'Wubi') from the Ubuntu website. That way you can install (or uninstall) Ubuntu like you would a regular Windows program. (One limitation of the Wubi installer is that you can only give Ubuntu a max of about 30GB of space to work with. That may or may not be a problem.)\nEither way, you'll end up with a laptop with both Ubuntu and Windows. Each time you boot up your computer, the first thing it will do is ask which OS you want.\nIf you get stuck with any of the steps, the internet has plenty of resources to guide you through the installation.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: You could install Ubuntu and keep windows. This will keep your Windows and all your things in tact. Look at the below address for help.\nHow can I install Ubuntu without removing Windows?\nIf you install Ubuntu without keeping Windows then you would have to make a copy of everything you want to keep. An \"external hard drive\" is really good for this.\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu inside Windows (It affects the disk performance though) or you can dual boot Ubuntu and Windows on the same machine (Neither way, you won't be having any data loss)\nNeat step by step documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot \n", "Q: What may cause Ubuntu to not be able to shut down and limp in the logout screen?

I did a web search to find a way how to uninstall the library, so that I can install it with the new settings, but I did not get a clear answer.

My question is this: is there any chance that the consequence of my action will come back to haunt me?\nI am also concerned, because the old library was not removed as well as the old headers. Another strange thing is that the old headers are in \n/usr/lib/mgl\n\nwhile the new ones are in\n/usr/local/lib/mgl2\n\nIs there any explanation for this?\n\nA: \nis there any chance that the consequence of my action will come back to haunt me?\n\nMaybe. Read on:\n\n\n*\n\n*The new (\"enable...:) configured libraries have overwritten the new misconfigured libraries you installed...no harm done.\n\n*The new libraries are installed under /usr/local because that's the default for a lot of Linux distributions, but not Ubuntu; Ubuntu puts them under /usr. The former is OK for binaries (/usr/local/bin), which Ubuntu has in its default path, and those will take precedence over any binaries installed in /usr/bin, but this is not true for libraries, because /usr/local/lib is not in the default path.\n\n*Any programs that use this library will continue using the older headers/version in /usr/lib, unless you specifically tell those programs to use the new ones, e.g. by prefixing them with LD_LIBRARY_PATH=... or by explicitly adding /usr/local/lib to your path. For compiling things which depend on this library, you'll need to explicitly specify the /usr/local/lib path to include the new headers.\n\n*To fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's a good idea to remove the repo-installed version of the library, unless it has lots of dependencies, in which case leave it be (or you'd have to recompile the lot).\n\n*Install checkinstall, which you can use instead of the final make install step to give you a deb file that is easy to install and uninstall.\n\n*Set the correct install prefix via the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr directive before compiling.\n\n\n\nThat should do it!\n\nA: Well, the new one it is using the libs from /usr/local/lib (this is a common place for softwares installed by the user). This is actually good thing, the main ideea it is to not to corrupt the packages installed via package managers.\nThe location of the libs are defined usually in the Makefile. I recommend to not to touch that unless you know what you are doing.

I'd like to install both Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows XP on a Dell laptop, and I was thinking about using a dual boot structure, and using the bulk of my hard drive as empty hard drive space to share files between the two operating systems (so choice of file system type is very important in this set-up). \n\nThe kind of partitioning structure I would like to use is\nPartition 1 - Ubuntu 12.04 (root) (20GB)\nPartition 2 - Ubuntu /home        (20GB)\nPartition 3 : Free Space          (560GB)\nPartition 4 : Windows XP          (35GB)\nPartition 5 : SWAP                (3GB)\n(Total Hardrive Capacity is ~640GB)\n\nMy question is; what is the best way to go about setting up this kind this system? \nShould I install Windows XP first and setup the partitions, and then install Ubuntu which I believe will install the GRUB bootloader for OS booting choice \nor \nDo I install Ubuntu first, setting up the available partitions and then perform a WIndows install?\nPlease let me know if there is anything in this setup that I have left out and should know about, including things related to setting particular partitions as logical or primary, and whether the boot partition and the filesystem partition should actually be two separate partitions.\n\nA: The Windows bootloader is very fussy and does NOT work well with other operating systems - it ignores them when installing and will overwrite their bootloader if it is installed in the MBR (master boot record) already. Installing Windows second makes it harder to get back into a workable grub menu.\nSo the recommended solution is to install Windows first, then install Ubuntu which shouldn't create conflicts in the MBR.\nIf you install Ubuntu first, then Windows, the MBR will have problems when installing service packs for example. Upon reboot, the system may fail or not boot at all, sometimes the SP updates will fail altogether and lead to instability. Then you will have to reboot into repair/command line to repair the MBR (the command FIXMBR). Then re-install GRUB everytime there is a significant Windows Update (not all updates are affected by this)!\nA simple partition set-up could look like:\nPartition 1: Windows XP \nPartition 2: Free Space\nPartition 3: Extended Partition (rest of disk)\nPartition 4:   Swap\nPartition 5:   Root\nPartition 6:   Home\nPartitions 4-6 are inside the extended partition. By having your Ubuntu installation inside an extended partition means it will boot from the extended partition and not / \"root\". Though it's up to you whether or not you want an extended partition.\nIt doesn't really matter where you do the partitioning as long as it gets done. To start with, you could install Windows and just partition what it needs, leaving the rest of the disk un-partitioned. Then when you install Ubuntu, partition the rest of the disk as needed.\nOr do it all in one fell swoop with a partition boot disk like gparted for example.\n\nA: You should install Windows XP first.  Create an NTFS partition for Windows XP, and set it to the desired size. Create a FAT32 partition to share data between the two operating systems in the amount that you want.  Then install Ubuntu, and create the partitions needed.  During the installation you can create the partitions needed  manually, or choose the automatic option.  This way you won't have to use boot-repair to fix your boot situation.\n\nA: In addition to the others' answers, you can also install Ubuntu first and then XP.  Then, use EasyBCD to chainload the Ubuntu partition from the Windows boot menu.  (Though this is a viable choice, the established method is usually a better idea.)\nI would recommend first using a GParted liveCD to make all your partitions before you install either OS.  That way, you don't have to worry about XP doing things like making a \"System Reserved\" partition.\n", "Q: Shotwell does not copy, but imports files without copying When I try to importing photos from my external harddisk into Shotwell, after disconnecting the HDD the photos disappear immediately.\nI saw that the photos had been imported into the database without being copied. Copying the whole file into the picture file is possible, but I would like to be able to keep the initial file order in my library (by filenames), not the one made by Shotwell (by date).\nThere was no problem copying photos from a dvd.\nIs there any possibility to have the same file structure for all photos or is there a bug in Shotwell?\nThanks\n\nA: When you import a folder with pictures into Shotwell it gives you two options:\n\nIn the first case, Copy Photos, Shotwell will store a local copy of the pictures in your computer. Thus, if you import from a removable drive, you will always have a copy of them available.\nIn the second case, Import in Place, shotwell will only create links to the pictures, thus if you unplug a removable drive with the pictures they will not be available.\nIf you want to preserve your structure of folders for your pictures I recommend that you copy your pictures manually to your hard drive (Pictures folder is a good option). After that you can Import in Place from shotwell (does not make sense to have 2 local copies of your pictures) and you will have them available. Shotwell will still classify them by date (default), but then you can 'Tag' your pictures if you want to arrange them in a different order (e.g. 'my birthday').\n\nA: Thanks to all, I found the solution!\nFirst I had to remove all Photos from a separate Missing Files view, which appeared in the sidebar.\n", "Q: How would I batch rename a lot of files using command-line? I have a problem which I am unable to solve: I need to rename a great dump of files using patterns. I tried using this, but I always get an error.\nI have a folder, inside with a lot of files. Running ls -1 | wc -l, it returns that I have like 160000 files inside. The problem is, that I wish to move these files to a Windows system, but most of them have characters like : and ? in them, which makes the file unaccessible on said Windows-based systems.\n(As a \"do not solve but deal with\" method, I tried booting up a LiveCD on the Windows system and moving the files using the live OS. Under that Ubuntu, the files were readable and writable on the mounted NTFS partition, but when I booted back on Windows, it showed that the file is there but Windows was unable to access it in any fashion: rename, delete or open.)\nI tried running rename 's/\\:/_' * inside the folder, but I got Argument list too long error. Some search revealed that it happens because I have so many files, and then I arrived here. The problem is that I don't know how to alter the command to suit my needs, as I always end up having various errors like\n\n\n*\n\n*Trying find -name '*:*' | xargs rename : _, it gives xargs: unmatched single quote; by default quotes are special to xargs unless you use the -0 option [\\n] syntax error at (eval 1) line 1, near \":\" [\\n] xargs: rename: exited with status 255; aborting\n\n*Adding the -0 after xargs turns the error message to xargs: argument line too long\nThese files are archive files generated by various PHP scripts. The best solution would be having a chance to rename them before they are moved to Windows, but if there is no way to do it, we might have a way to rename the files while they are moved to Windows. I use samba and proftpd to move the files.\nUnfortunately, graphical software are out of the question as the server containing the files is what it is, a server, with only command-line interface.\n\nA: I use this for mass renaming: vidir.

You can work past this by either renaming one file at a time\nfor file in ./*[:?]*; do \n    mv \"$file\" \"${file//[:?]/_}\"\ndone\n\nor fill an array and process them in chunks. How large the chunk could be depends on the average length of the filenames and the ARG_MAX value; or just set a low enough value to be safe, e.g. 1000:\nfiles=( ./*[:?]* ) n=${#files[@]}\nsize=1000\nfor (( i=0; i<n; i+=size )); do\n    rename 'y/:?/__/' \"${files[@]:i:size}\"\ndone\n\nAlso see BashFAQ 30.\n", "Q: Qt menus disappear in Unity I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 and updated the whole system last week.

I am a newbie to all of this stuff.\nInitially I had a OS CD of Ubuntu 10.4 version. I never tried to install it. Now I have lost my CD somewhere. Earlier I copied the content to my laptop. When I tried to install by copying to another CD/pendrive it didn't install.\nNow i am using Windows. But I would like to install Ubuntu, because everyone said that Linux/Ubuntu is an amazing OS.\nSo I searched in google for a solution. With Unetbootin, pendrive linux, I can make a bootable pendrive to install. But Unetbootin asks for an ISO-image. I did many experiment and wastes more than 9 CD's. I have no experience with that.

I occasionally update my kernel from this web site \nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nI have been always downloading 3 deb files for installing \nlinux header all, linux image and linux headers. I noticed one more deb file recently for 64 bit kernel called Linux-image-extra.\nI would like to know what does kernel file Linux-image-extra do and should I also install it?\n\nA: This answer is obsolete for modern Ubuntu releases\nWithout the extra package, most hardware won't work!\nIt contains extra drivers left out of the base kernel package; install it only if you need these drivers\nSometimes, a specific variant of the linux-image is slimmed down by removing the less common kernel modules (drivers).  In this case, the linux-image-extra package simply contains all of the \"extra\"  kernel modules which were left out.\n\n*\n\n*Officially, this only happens for the -virtual image; the most common hypervisors (Virtualbox, VMWare, Xen, KVM) emulate a well-defined and restricted set of hardware, so removing unnecessary drivers which increase the size of the kernel/initrd is a good idea. You can always get them back by installing the extras package.\n\n\n*The kernel team also appears to have adopted this method for some of the mainline-PPA -generic kernels; the reasoning and solution remain the same -- if it looks like the base kernel image is missing a module you need, install extras.\n\n\n*As far as I know, the above approach has not been taken for the Quantal kernels -- only -virtual is affected as usual.\n\nA: In previous Ubuntu versions, the linux-image-extras was optional, tailored for virtual machines / servers.\nAs of Ubuntu 14.04, linux-image is a slim package (for virtual machines), and linux-image-extras now contains many drivers required for desktops.\nIn particular, usb-hid (keyboard support), is only present once you install the linux-image-extras package.

The Intel card is connected to the laptop display only.  The nVidia card is connected to the display port and HDMI port.\nI am running bumblebee for limited optimus support (i.e. power-saving only) and realise there is no seamless way to enable dual monitor output with extended desktop at this point.\nThat said, since I spend quite a portion of my time at my desk with my laptop connected to my charger, what is the easiest way to bypass bumblebee and just enable the nVidia card and utilise my external display (and not use the laptop display)?\nI am kind of hoping to configure my laptop in such a way that I can simply specify an xorg.conf, restart lightdm and have the external display used.  Then, if I remove the xorg.conf and restart lightdm, the laptop display is used.  (Or a similarly quick switching method).\nI am happy to log-out and back in during the transition from external to laptop display.\nI did try this really-quickly by specifying a simply xorg.conf with the nvidia driver specified, but the xserver seemed to complain about not finding the nvidia module.  Other questions similar to this seem to relate to enabling the external display alongside the laptop display.\nMany thanks for any help,\nWhytey\n\nA: I believe what your trying to achieve is using the nvidia functionality on your DM DISPLAY MANAGER which is LightDM, I read it on the bublebee wiki an its possible but there a warning about running nvidia on your DISPLAY MANAGER.Just read the bumblebee official site and wiki im pretty sure there the intructions there.\n\nA: Because the nvidia driver requires some proprietary libraries, you need to reconfigure your system each time you switch between nvidia and intel drivers. If you use Ubuntu, you can do this with the program update-alternatives. Alternatively, you can update your xorg.conf Files Section with the correct ModulePath and make sure that all your GL programs are started with the correct LD_LIBRARY_PATH. You can find the correct values in bumblebee.conf, look for the lines with LibraryPath= and XorgModulePath=.\n\nA: It is possible to do multi-monitor on the later versions of Ubuntu (14.04 and up), using nVidia Prime.  \nIt relies on the nVidia binaries and the nVidia card needs to be enabled to do it (which reduced battery efficiency) but it works very well.\n", "Q: Network connection problem  I am using ubuntu 11.10 LTS.\nwhen I switch on my lappy, the network connections i have created works fine, but after sometime (not always) they disappear and no connection lefts available for use. the default wired connection also disapprears along with DSL connection i have created.

If I force the USB device to connect to the guest OS I lose the usage of it in Mac OSX but then the tablet works fine under Ubuntu.\nI can't decide if this is an issue with Ubuntu handling the 'fake' HID or the VM software doing something strange, but a Windows guest works fine with it.\n\nA: Perhaps change from \"Absolute\" positioning to \"Relative\", then it should behave more like a mouse?\nIn xterm:\nxsetwacom list\n\nFind your stylus device id # in the list\nxsetwacom set $ID \"Mode\" \"Relative\"\n\n", "Q: Tool to fire up EC2 instance and SSH in?

Of course I also want the needed repositories added so the KDE desktop will be kept updated.\nHow would I go about doing that?\n\nA: It's best to install the kubuntu-desktop package first and THEN remove any installed KDE apps you don't need. This way, you get the full desktop environment experience and can stay updated, while not keeping redundant programs installed. \nNote that a lot of Unity/Gnome apps will not behave according to the KDE theme set as a KDE-native app would. \n\nA: The command / package you want is :\nsudo apt-get install kde-plasma-desktop\n\nYou can also search software centre for 'kde-plasma-desktop' and install it that way.\nThis package installs KDE desktop with minimal applications, and you can continue to use you ubuntu/gnome apps with it.

In the meantime, I've upgraded to quantal and reported a proper bug, but if someone from the support community should have an answer, that wouldn't go amiss either. (Paragraph has been edited to refer to the reported bug)\nSetup\nThis is Ubuntu 12.04 precise connected to an Acer T231H multitouch monitor. Actually I encountered this on more than one OS setup, one of them done through debootstrap. Packages involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*xserver-xorg-input-evdev 1:2.7.0-0ubuntu1\n\n*linux-image-*-generic 3.2.0-24.39 on one and 3.2.0-25 on the other system\n\n\nSymptom\nThe mouse events as X sends them to the applications are inconsitent. This can be debugged using xev.\nThe first touch of the screen is preceeded by a MotionNotify event which already has state 0x100, i.e. left mouse button pressed. After that comes a ButtonPress event, again with state 0x100 although that value should indicate the state of the buttons before the event occurred. The subsequent drag is all right, and the ButtonRelease as well, but the 0x100 bit in the state value will never become zero again.\nEven if I've got an ordinary mouse connected as well, it will henceforth report every movement as if I were keeping the left mouse button down. The only cure that I could find was restarting the X server. Together with the ButtonPress and ButtonRelease events, this constant bit for left mouse button amounts to an inconsistent reporting of button state.\nJava applications e.g. will report every move as a drag due to this issue, with severe implications for focus management. This makes using differenent parts of the application almost impossible, as mouse movement will only be reported to the component where the mouse entered the application window.\nComparison of expected and actual behaviour\nExpected behaviour:\n\n\n*\n\n*MotionNotify with state 0x000 when dragging the ordinary mouse\n\n*MotionNotify with state 0x000 for move prior to touch, or no event at all\n\n*ButtonPress with state 0x000 when touching the screen\n\n*MotionNotify with state 0x100 while dragging the finger\n\n*ButtonRelease with state 0x100 when lifting the finger\n\n*MotionNotify with state 0x000 when dragging the ordinary mouse afterwards\n\n\nActual behaviour:\n\n\n*\n\n*MotionNotify with state 0x000 when dragging the ordinary mouse before the first touch\n\n*MotionNotify with state 0x100 for prior to ButtonPress event\n\n*ButtonPress with state 0x100 when touching the screen\n\n*MotionNotify with state 0x100 while dragging the finger\n\n*ButtonRelease with state 0x100 when lifting the finger\n\n*MotionNotify with state 0x100 when dragging the ordinary mouse afterwards\n\n\nA: Solved this myself\nAnalysis of the main bug\nI've dug through the sources of both evdev and the core x server. Turns out that this bug is not in evdev after all, but in xserver-xorg-core. A commit there (which is also included in the Xorg upstream) removed the only piece of code which ever set the TOUCH_END flag for an event. Without this flag, UpdateDeviceState will not remove the button from the state, thus leading to the \"Button is always pressed\" behaviour from my original question. Simply reverting that commit restored main core events functionality, i.e. the button was marked released right after the ButtonRelease event.\nMinor bug on mouse press event\nOne issue remains in the xev output, though: The ButtonPress event already has state 0x100, but the state should reflect the state of the mouse buttons before the event occurred. This appears to be due to the way changes to the ownership of a touch sequence are handled. At one point in that ownership management code, the touch history is replayed using TouchEventHistoryReplay, but the internal state of the device isn't set to what it was prior to that replay. I haven't formulated a patch for this yet. When I do, I'll attach it to the bug report. I consider this question here answered even without a patch for that minor point, as it is a separate issue.\nHow to debug this\nIn case someone reads this with a similar problem: I had considered using gdb, but I was far from certain whether I'd be able to properly switch vt if the X server was stopped in the debugger, and I didn't have a working ssh server configured on that machine. So I used one of the oldest debugging aids ever and liberally scattered ErrorF calls all over the code, Xi/exevents.c in particular. I then recompiled the code (which I had initially compiled using debuild) without installing it, and ran the compiled binary (build-main/hw/xfree86/Xorg) as root like this:\n$ make -C build-main\n$ sudo -s\n# apt-get install openbox\n# ( sleep 3; DISPLAY=:1 exec openbox; ) & build-main/hw/xfree86/Xorg :1\n\nThis recompiles the code (takes ages even for a minor modification, so it seems that dependency management in the makefiles is suboptimal, but I didn't feel like digging into that as well). Then after becoming root, it starts the new X server, and starts openbox on that server a few moments later. Note that you'll be running openbox as root, so this is strictly for testing only.\n", "Q: Xinerama with hardware acceleration at the same time Is there some way that I can have Xinerama enabled and still use hardware acceleration?

Since this virtual monitor is all software, there can be no hardware acceleration.\nI've solved this by using a graphics card with a built-in DVI splitter. The OS can only see a single big monitor.\nMaximizing windows work after tweaking compiz, see Split monitor in two.\n", "Q: firefox window size and position I am using Ubuntu 12.04 with a dual monitor setup.\nI like Firefox to have a specific position and size on my screen. So I resize it and position it like I want it. But when I close and reopen it, it randomly resizes and positions itself as it wants.  \nIs there a way to make Firefox remember it's size and position?  I have tried compizconfig settings manager but this changes the default behavior of all firefox windows, including pop up dialog boxes.  I'm hoping there is a better method.\nThanks\n\nA: This does not solve the fundamental problem, but if the position you prefer is a simple one, like maximized or one third of the screen horizontally, then QuickTile might be able to help you. Have look at it here. You will need to add /path/to/script --daemonize as a startup application.\n", "Q: Copy/Backup ext4 files to external ntfs hdd: Permissions etc Normally I backup my files (from ext4 drive) to an external ext4 hdd. Now I want to copy/backup some files to an external ntfs hdd, so I have the possibility to access them from Windows, too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there something I have to take care of (permissions etc.)?\n\n*Do I just copy the files or do I need to use a special program (rsync etc.) or specific cp parameters?\n\n*Can I use the ntfs hdd also as a backup drive and restore the files to the ext4?\n\n\nA: ntfs doesn't store unix ownership and permissions without special configuration.  This generally doesn't matter to data files like documents or music, but if you are planning on backing up the whole system, the permissions will need to be preserved, so you will need to use something like tar rather than just copying the files.\n", "Q: Samsung ml-1665 cannot stop printing I cant stop printing. Under printer options when I click stop button nothing happens. And when I turn printer off and back on then it keeps printing the unfinished job. Is there any other way to stop printing jobs?

See:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#user-job\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#enabling\n\n\n*You never need to reboot after creating any type of Upstart job—they are automatically detected by Upstart (using inotify).\n\n*The service command is not part of Upstart—it is the SystemV tool to manipulate SysV jobs. However, Upstart provides SystemV compatibility such that Upstart system jobs can also be manipulated via service (for convenience). The Upstart equivalent commands are start, stop and, restart.\n\n*For user jobs, you must use start, stop and, restart (or the initctl equivalents).\nFinally, note that user jobs are very basic currently. We plan to enhance them significantly for 12.10 but for now be aware that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upstart will run all user jobs using /bin/sh -e regardless of which shell you use by default. That -e is also very important (man sh for details).\n\n*Upstart will only set a minimal set of variables in the user job environment. Hence, you should probably set variables like HOME like this:\nenv HOME=/home/james\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#env\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#export\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#debugging-a-script-which-appears-to-be-behaving-oddly\n", "Q: Inkscape won't open .cdr files Hello I'm running Kubuntu 12.04 and I've installed Inkscape because I need to edit a .cdr file, Inkscape works like normal but the sole task I need it to do is edit said .cdr file which I understand it should be capable off by default.\nWhenever I try to open the file though I get the following error:\nUniConvertor failed:\n\nThe eror itself is  longer but what it seems to be saying that it can't find this application, and I myself haven't found it in the package manager.\nIf someone has experienced something similar or has a simple solution for editing cdr's I'm no artist I just need to change some names, I would be very gratefull.\nThe full error.\n\nA: According to the error log\n   load_drawing_from_file\n    raise SketchLoadError(_(\"unrecognised file type\"))\n    app.events.skexceptions.SketchLoadError: unrecognised file type\n\nthe CDR file ist not recognized. \nWhat is the version of the CDR files? \nUniConvertor supports only the following CDR versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*CorelDRAW ver.7-X3,X4 (CDR/CDT/CCX/CDRX/CMX)\n\n\n(Information from here: http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=uniconvertor)\n\nA: You can find it under Ubuntu Software Center with the name Universal Vector Graphics Translator:\npython-uniconvertor\nOR\nYou can find uniconvertor .deb packages here:\nhttp://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=uniconvertor&op=download\n\nA: LibreOffice Draw, included with LibreOffice suite has the ability to open most CDR files flawlessly, just some specialized features may end needing manual fix after opening.\n", "Q: Accidently installed grub to usb While doing a fresh ubuntu install (dual boot with XP using resize), I somehow managed to install grub to the source usb instead of to the harddrive. Normal harddrive boot goes straight to XP. Booting from USB leads me to grub. From there i can boot into ubuntu. Pretty cool actually, but not what I had in mind.\nHow do I install Grub to HD? \nHow do I recover my USB?\n\nA: From your booted Ubuntu system, open a terminal, then use the following commands : \nsudo grub-install /dev/sdX\nsudo update-grub\n\nReplacing sdX with the actual drive, which will probably be sda, but use disk utility to double check if you are unsure.\n\nA: You can wipe your USB stick by Format.  Plug it into your Windows machine, go to My Computer, and then right click your USB stick and select \"Format\".\nIf you don't like formatting, you can try deleting the partition on the USB with GParted and recreate the partition.

I've been trying to connect with ipv6 enabled networks with my Broadcom Wireless card under Ubuntu 12.04. The wireless card model is BCM4306.\n$lspci\n$Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 03)\n$Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10)\n\nI have been unsuccesful to connect through an ipv6 address, but I can still connect to a network when assigned an ipv4 address. While searching for an answer or a solution, I know the kernel can handle dealing with ipv6. So, what's left to question should be the hardware handling the connection. Unfortunately nothing comes up when I specifically try to search for information on BCM4306 ipv6 capabilities.\nI just tried using a wired connection to establish an ipv6 only connection to the network I'm on right now, but I got the same behavior of constant disconnections. Maybe it's not the hardware? I don't know..\nI don't want to disable ipv6 on my machine as relevant networks I'll be connecting to will be using it exclusively, but I'm not sure what is wrong and which parts should I replace/fix to get this working.. Could someone please point me in a fruitful direction to get ipv6 working under Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: If you are using the broadcom-sta drivers then I believe they are not IPv6 compatible. At least not for the advertisement. I have the same problem with my card using the broadcom-sta drivers. My card (BCM43227) is not supported by any other driver, but it seems yours is.\nLooks like you can try the b43legacy drivers and possibly the b43. My old laptop used the b43 with IPv6 just fine but you would have to test out b43legacy to see if it will support IPv6.\n\nA: Network card drivers have nothing to do with IPv6 support. IP is layer 3 in networking (DoD/OSI model) and your card with its drivers only take care of layer 2.\nIf we will have IPv7 some time later or go back to IPX, you don't have to worry about NIC drivers - they're not working on this level, it's your OS (kernel).\n\nIn the image above, the \"Process Application\" is just the responsibility of the application, \"Host-to-Host\" is the transport layer, provided by the kernel, \"Internet\" is about addressing and is also done by the kernel. \"Network Access\" is what the NIC drivers and hardware are about.\nWhile some of the operations in the pieces in the layers above (especially TCP) can be offloaded on the hardware, it's not a big deal if it can't, as it's just done in software then.\nIn case you have general IPv6 connection issues, you'll have to be more specific about what you're trying to accomplish and what you've tried.\n", "Q: Can't find Intel Wireless-N 1000 after waking from sleep I've tried a lot of proposed solutions, most of them adding files to /etc/pm/config.d, as well as WiFi stops working after waking from suspend with a Broadcom 43225 and nothing has worked.\nhardware info:\n[colleen@colleen-HP ~]$ sudo lshw -C network\n[sudo] password for colleen: \n  *-network               \n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller\n       vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:07:00.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: 06\n       serial: 2c:27:d7:b1:ea:67\n       size: 10Mbit/s\n       capacity: 1Gbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix vpd bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI duplex=half firmware=N/A latency=0 link=no multicast=yes port=MII speed=10Mbit/s\n       resources: irq:41 ioport:4000(size=256) memory:c1404000-c1404fff memory:c1400000-c1403fff\n  *-network\n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: Centrino Wireless-N 1000\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:0d:00.0\n       logical name: wlan0\n       version: 00\n       serial: 8c:a9:82:99:48:8c\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=iwlagn driverversion=3.0.0-21-generic-pae firmware=39.31.5.1 build 35138 ip=192.168.0.4 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn\n       resources: irq:48 memory:c5500000-c5501fff\n\nIs anyone else still having this problem?

The root cause of this requirement is the libc libraries shipped with 12.04 -- libc is the basis on which every single Ubuntu binary/library depends. This requirement can be bypassed too.\nFor 10.04 (or newer), your manufacturer requires you to use a special 2.6.34 kernel\nYou must use the special 2.6.34 kernel DMP supplies here, which is required to install Ubuntu 10.04 (or newer, if possible).\nThis fact is made perfectly clear on their support page:\n\nCan you use the 2.6.34 kernel with Ubuntu 12.04?\nI see no reason why you can't. DMP's FTP directory provides the kernel source as well as all patches. Of course, no one without a Vortex86DX/SX can confirm if it will work out of the box, or what you will need to make sure it works.\nI very much doubt the manufacturer is going to hand you official 12.04 support on a platter since they seem to be having problems even with 10.10 and are stuck on 10.04. Unfortunately, that's how proprietary embedded hardware often is.\n\nA: Unpack the *.deb file containing the modification to see in what form the module is distributed. Also have a look at the content of the other package and see what files are shipped there. If some files are precompiled modules for a specific kernel version (*.ko files), then those modules will almost certainly fail to cooperate with a more recent kernel, and updating Ubuntu without updating the kernel is asking for trouble as well.\nIf, on the other hand, the kernel modules are distributed in a source format (*.c), perhaps containing some binary blob, then the deb package will likely use dkms or similar to have modules compiled for the current kernel, and the shell script might do some compilation for the current kernel as well. In those cases, you should see whether the modules do compile against the sources of a current Ubuntu kernel. You should be able to compile them on a test system, not using the target hardware just yet.\nIf they do compile successfully, chances are good that they will run as intended, although there are of course no guarantees. If they fail to compile, you can see whether you can locate a kernel version recent enough to support an upgrade but still old enough to be compatible with those modules. Or you could adjust the module sources to take kernel API changes into account.\n\nA: I do not know of official sources, but from 3.2 to 2.6 kernel versions there is a huge leap. If you install an Ubuntu 12.04 on that board and then apply a 2.6 kernel on top of that you will surely run into incompatibility issues (hardware and software wise, libraries, etc). Essentially you might end up with a barely usable system. Newer versions of ubuntu rely heavily on the latest kernel developments.\nLooks to me that you have a problem with your DNS server configuration in your 8.04 version. If you fix that you should be able to install build-essential without any issues.\nRun \n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nand check what the output tells you.\nIf you do have internet connection, then you can go here: and download the .deb package of build-essential for ubuntu 8.04.\n", "Q: Forcibly removing zramswap-enabler from my computer zramswap-enabler has put my package manage in an \"inconsistent state.\"\nI tried forcibly removing it with this commend:\ndpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq\n\nBut it seems to freeze and doesn't complete operation.\nI tried modifying my dpkg status file as recommended here, but that didn't work either. When I tried upgrading my other files, zramswap still showed up, and stopped it from completing.\nAre there any other ways I can force remove this file, or will I have to reinstall Ubuntu?\n\nA: I figured it out.\nI killed dpkg from the background.\nsudo killall -9 dpkg\n\nRemoved zram swap references from the dpkg status file.\nsudo cp /var/lib/dpkg/status /var/lib/dpkg/status.bkup\nsudo gedit /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nRemoved the zram sources from the package manager.\nI used the gui.\n\nThan ran this.\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n", "Q: Which private keys are tested by ssh without configuration? I know there are several questions about ssh keys and how to configure it. But I found none to answer my question.\nSo here it is: I have several ssh keys in my .ssh directory. For some remotes different keys.\nNow I have neither configured in .ssh/config which key to use for which host, nor have I added them to an agent manually, what some questions here already mentioned. I just created the keys with ssh-keygen and it works.\nNow I would like to know who is responsible for that and which keys are tried automatically? I have something in my mind that says about five keys are automatically checked for compatibility - but I cannot find where I found this information.\nDoes ssh-keygen automatically add those keys to an agent? Or does ssh search for any matching key by default?\n\nA: The ssh client will check all your keys until it finds one that matches.\nThis is how it works (this is very simplified, before this a quite complex dance has been made to encrypt all of this):\n\n\n*\n\n*The server creates an auth token.\n\n*The token is encrypted using your public key on the server.\n\n*The server send the encrypted token to the client.\n\n*The client tries to decrypt the token, using all known private keys.\n\n*If it is successful it will send the decrypted token back to the server.\n\n*If the token matchs the server will let the client in.\n\n\nWhat files are keys depends on the client.\nFor the Openssh client (Ubuntu default client), according to its man page, the files that are supposed to be private keys are ./sshid_rsa, .ssh/id_dsa, .ssh/id_ecdsa, plus those given after the -i flag (it supports multiple files) and those declared in the config file.\nYou can give it the -v option to make it print a line when it tries to use any file as a key. This is an example from a non-key login:\n$ ssh -v www.hostremoved.com\nOpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1, OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config\n<...>\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password\ndebug1: Next authentication method: publickey\ndebug1: Offering RSA public key: /home/javier/.ssh/id_rsa\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password\ndebug1: Trying private key: /home/javier/.ssh/id_dsa\ndebug1: Trying private key: /home/javier/.ssh/id_ecdsa\ndebug1: Next authentication method: password\n<...>\n\nAs you can see, it prints all the keys it tries, it fails all. You can use this in your system to discover what files is ssh using in your own system.\nBelow you can see the output if some existing key is found and tried\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password\ndebug1: Offering RSA public key: user@xyz\n\nuser@xyz is the information appended to the public key.\n\nIf you're wondering how your ssh client finds your private keys, it's not magic. Under Gnome (xfce and KDE also) there is a special ssh-agent that automatically adds keys in .ssh directory that have a correspondending public key with the ending .pub.\nIf you not have such a comfortable ssh agent, you'll have to add your private keys with ssh-add key.\n\nA: Assuming that you have copied the public key to the authorized_keys file on the remote machine, the ssh client will check whichever private key on the local machine matches the public key on the remote machine.\n\nA: Copied/pasted from ssh_config(5) in openssh-client 1:5.3p1-3ubuntu7:\n\nIdentityFile\nSpecifies a file from which the user's RSA or DSA\n  authentication identity is read.  The default is ~/.ssh/identity for\n  protocol version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa for protocol\n  version 2. Additionally, any identities represented by the\n  authentication agent will be used for authentication.\nThe file name may use the tilde syntax to refer to a user's home\n  directory or one of the following escape characters: ‘%d’ (local\n  user's home directory), ‘%u’ (local user name), ‘%l’ (local host\n  name), ‘%h’ (remote host name) or ‘%r’ (remote user name).\nIt is possible to have multiple identity files specified in\n  configuration files; all these identities will be tried in sequence.\n\nThe bottom line is the it depends on the protocol version. For version 2 (most likely these days), id_rsa and id_dsa are tried in that order according to the above doc. Newer versions may include other type of keys by default like id_ecdsa. Check that man page in your version for the details.\n", "Q: Shall I download updates from kernel 3.2. when I already installed 3.4.3? I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and due to the weak support of hybrid graphics in the originally distributed kernel (I think it was 3.2) I updated the kernel to 3.4.3 today. \nBut the system is still suggesting me to download some updates of kernel 3.2 when the software update application is popping up.\nWill it harm my system if I still download those updates?\n\nA: If you update a kernel, then all you are going to do is placing a couple of files in\n/boot/{config, initrd, System.map, vmlinuz}-{version}\n/usr/src/linux-headers-{version}\n\nThe kernel itself is only an executable. That gets started by the bootloader (configuration is in /boot/grub/grub.cfg ). \nThis in turn allows a user to have multiple kernel versions installed simultaneously. Not knowing how you installed the 3.4 kernel version, I don't think that installing these updates will do any harm to your computer (especially if you downloaded the .deb from kernel.org and installed it manually).\nIf you can find the files for a 3.2 kernel in /boot/ and the corresponding /usr/src/linux-headers you should be safe. Since you should be able to boot a 3.2 kernel in case your 3.4 kernel somehow doesn't work anymore.\nI would however recommend using a PPA for unstable kernels, since it will take care of all the dependencies.\nThe suggestions for updating 3.2 kernel files might come from the fact that you weren't able to install the 3.4 kernel correctly and you're still running a 3.2 kernel. In this case I recommend using the PPA to install the 3.4 kernel.\nThis comment provides a good explanation on how to upgrade to unstable kernels\n\nA: 3.4.3 is the latest version than 3.2. You can install kernel 3.2 and select kernel you want to use when booting at Grub windows.\nI suggest you remove old kernel to avoid any update for older kernel.\nOpen terminal and check your current kernel:\nuname -r \n\nDO NOT REMOVE THIS KERNEL!\nNext, type the command below to view / list all installed kernels on your system.\ndpkg --list | grep linux-image \n\nFind all the kernels that lower than your current kernel. When you know which kernel to remove, continue below to remove it. Run the commands below to remove the kernel you selected.\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-x.x.x.x-generic\n\nFinally, run the commands below to update grub2\nsudo update-grub2 \n\nReboot your system.\n\n\n\n", "Q: How do I change the \"system default\" keyboard?

I just have a wired connection so it should be quite simple.\nMy computer has two interfaces, eth0 and eth1.\nI'm not sure which one my wire is plugged into right now.\nAt first it was working correctly, but then I tried to set a static IP address, and from there it's not working anymore, even if I cancel the modifications I made. I even tried the other interface, and it's not working either. Right now I just want it to work regardless of the interface.\nPlease help me to figure out what is not working properly.\nOne thing I'm sure of is that both the cable and the router do work, so it's a linux configuration problem.\nHere's what I've done:\nI've been to /etc/network/interfaces and I've added the following:\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.100\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\n\nI doubled checked that these are the correct values for my network. Then I did:\n/etc/init.d/network restart\n\nand even tried:\nifdown eth1\nifup eth1\n\nI sometimes got the message 'RTNETLINK answers: file exists - error when doing ifup on alias eth1:1 on RHEL5.'\nSometimes it works just for a while and I don't understand what's wrong.\nRight now it's not working again.\nIf I ping the gateway I get an answer from one of my own interfaces (apparently) saying icmp host unreachable\nI can't copy paste so it's hard to copy the whole output of ifconfig. I would have to do it by hand. But if you ask me for a specific line I can give it to you.\nIt roughly returns:\nlo:    \n127.0.0.1    \neth0:    \nlink:ethernet    \ninet addr: 192.168.1.3 (this address range can only come from the dhcp)\nbcast: 192.168.1.255    \nmask 255.255.255.0    \neth1:    \n192.168.1.100    \nbcast: 192.168.1.255    \nmask 255.255.255.0\n\n\nA: I would first figure out which interface you are using, and just configure that one. Do you have a link light?  \nLink light assumes you are looking at the actual system -- most ether adapters have lights for various things -- protocol up, speed, etc.. Usually, checking that you've got green lights where the line is plugged is the first step. \nYou can also plug/unplug the cable and check dmesg. \nHere's what I see from dmesg when I unplug/replug my ethernet cable:\n[16661.901920] e1000e: eth0 NIC Link is Down\n[16666.460518] e1000e: eth0 NIC Link is Up 1000 Mbps Full Duplex, Flow Control: Rx\n\nYou might want to at first go back to a known good configuration.  Perhaps test thaqt you can still get DHCP.  Here's my basic /etc/network/interfaces for dhcp:\nauto lo eth0\niface lo inet loopback\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nAlso see How do you configure desktop for a static IP address? . \n\nA: Network Manager is the issue.

I wanted to know, what is the best way to use the find command efficiently?\nI generally use, find [filename] [dir] which gives me a long list of file names none of them any way related to my search.\nI simply need to find one file in a particular directory. What is the command for that?\n\nA: you usually tell find where to begin the search, and what to look for. So the syntax for paths to search and what you're actually trying to find is different.\nFor the use case you mention, let's assume you want to find the passwd file in /etc:\nfind /etc/ -name passwd\n\nyou're saying \"starting in etc, look for a file whose name is passwd\nif you don't specify criteria (or \"options\" in find parlance), what find does is, it starts in the path (or paths) you specify, and finds all files and directories underneath, recursively. So the options \"filter\" those files to narrow down what you're looking for.\nFind all JPG files anywhere in your filesystem:\nfind / -name \"*jpg\" \n\nUsing quotes in your options is recommended because otherwise shell expansion can cause you headaches.\nFind any pdf files, regardless of case, in either Documents or Downloads:\nfind Documents/ Downloads/ -iname \"*pdf\"\n\nIf you do man find and scroll down to TESTS, you will find all the \"criteria\" that find can use to narrow down your search. You can search for files with specific filenames, owned by specific users or groups, having a specific file permission, being of a specific type (e.g. -type d will find only directories, while -type f will find only plain files, excluding directories), files newer or older than a specific number of days (or minutes), files that are empty, that are executable, and so on.\nIn find's man page you will also find a section called ACTIONS, these can go after the criteria and will be triggered by any file that matches all the criteria. So you can have find doing things like deleting files it finds, executing arbitrary commands on them, and so on.\nBut of course the basic syntax remains:\nfind [starting path(s)] [conditions or criteria]\n\n", "Q: Speaker doesn't mute when head phone is plugged Ubuntu 12.04 \nHP dv7-3170 with Codec: IDT 92HD75B3X5\ni solved this problem by adding the following line to alsa-base.conf \noptions snd-hda-intel model=hp-dv5 enable_msi=1\nyesterday after applying all updates via update manager i have no sound on my speakers and on my earphones.\nif i comment the above line in alsa-base.conf i get sound again and also get my original problem.\nwhat can i do to revert changes...\nthanks\n\nA: Found a workaround to this problem.\nI found that the problem is with the kernel version.\nPreviously, I had version 3.2.0.24 and after upgrade I got 3.2.0.25.\nAs a workaround, I have to select the previous kernel version in the grub boot menu.\n", "Q: .sh script won't run \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I run .sh files in Terminal? \n\nI'm trying to install Craftbukkit on my Ubuntu 12.04 server.

Can anyone post a tutorial, an example or some docs?\nUsing next things for developing my app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 LTS totally updated\n\n*Python 2.7.3\n\n*Obviously, GTK+ 3\n\n*Glade 3.12.1\n\n\nThe app which I'm developing is Virtuam (candidate at the App Showdown!)\n\nA: Have a look at this example on how to connect events to callbacks in Gtk 3 and Python. In short, you use the connect() method to connect a signal name (which is emitted when an event such as a button click occurs) to a callback, which is the function that will handle your event.\ndef __init__(self):\n    # Other initialization code\n\n    # We create a button\n    self.button = Gtk.Button(label=\"Click Here\")\n    # We connect the 'clicked' signal to the callback\n    self.button.connect(\"clicked\", self.on_button_clicked)\n\ndef on_button_clicked(self, widget):\n    # This function will be called whenever the user presses the button\n    print \"Hello World\"\n\nYou can also watch the Gtk3 Introduction Workshop video that is part of the Ubuntu App Showdown.\nIf you're using Glade, you will need to make to make sure that the on_<name-of-your-button>_clicked() callback is defined in the code as a method of your window.\nIf you're using Quickly, that's all you'll need to worry about.\nOtherwise, you'll need to manually connect the signal to the callback. You've got two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do it in the code with self.builder.get_object('name-of-your-button').connect() - assuming builder is the name of your Gtk.Builder() in which you've loaded your Glade UI.\n\n*Do it with Glade looking at the properties of your button, choosing the signals tab and then writing the name of your callback in the 'clicked' signal.\n\n", "Q: Where is Python source code? I have Python 2.7 installed for learning purposes (I'm a starting programmer reading 'Learn Python The Hard Way') and wanted to know how some things were done.\nI installed it from Synaptic and want to know the folder that the source code is in. Can anyone help me here?\n\nA: *\n\n*If you enable the source code repositories in \"Software sources\" application (software-properties-gtk), you can download the latest python source that is related to the package:\napt-get source python\n\nYou can do that for any ubuntu/debian package.\n\n*You can always google your way to the source code: http://www.python.org/download/releases/ \n\nA: *\n\n*Try from command line: \ndpkg -L python2.7\n\nIt shows you where the files are installed in your system.\n\n*Try to install the package python2.7-examples. It contains many useful examples for learning purposes.\n\nA: It's not clear to me what source you are asking for. Python is installed by default on Ubuntu and the 2.7 version is installed on Ubuntu 12.04 (and I believe earlier versions). Is it python 2.7 that you installed with synaptic? Ubuntu uses CPython, so named because it is written in C. Therefore its source is not put on your computer unless you ask for it. medigeek has posted a helpful answer that will tell you how to download it.\nUbuntu uses python for many of its packages, for example ubiquity (the Ubuntu installer), Jockey (Additional Drivers), and Startup Disk Creator. Since packages written in python are distributed in source form and compiled on installation, you can examine these packages on your system. For example, jockey has source code at /usr/share/pyshared/jockey/. /usr/share/pyshared has python source for lot's of packages (almost 300 on my system).\nThe source for python 2.7 itself can be found at http://hg.python.org/cpython. Other versions of python have had their source imported onto Launchpad. You can see them here. Click on one you want to see and you can then click \"Browse the Code\".\nGood luck learning Python.\n\nA: Other answers have pointed you toward the source code for upstream Python.\nDownstream Python (the specific versions provided in Ubuntu) has source code that you can browse here.\nBy the way, if you're just starting to learn Python, you should almost certainly focus primarily on Python 3.\n\nA: I'm assuming you are looking for the demos and simple example programs that ship with python.  You can install the python source package using:\ncd /somewhere/you/want/source/code/\nsudo apt-get source python\n\nThe demo programs will be in the Tools/demo folder after it finished installing.\nAlternately, you can just browse those directly online without installing anything:\nhttp://hg.python.org/cpython/file/a970054a93fb/Tools/demo \n", "Q: Google`s Chrome won't reopen prior windows with \"continue where I left off\" checked Recently chrome stopped reopening the windows/tabs from it previous sessions.\nIs there a way to fix this?\n\nA: Looks like a bug in Cloud printing maybe the culprit.\nDisable in in Cloud print...\nTo disable \"Cloud Print\"\nOpen \"Settings\" from Google wrench icon...\n- Make sure Setting is selected on left panel , not history or extensions. &c\n- - Select \"Show advanced settings\" at bottom of window if shown...\n- - - Near at at the bottom click in \"Disable Google Cloud ...\"\n- - - - Some have reported Background apps/  Continue running...

I tried looking at my kde settings and looking under colors and nothing seems out of the ordinary, and I don't know if that is where dolphin is getting its colors from since I'm using gnome 3. I'm using Ambiance for a color theme, so I looked in /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk.css  and saw base color is white and so is selected fg color.  So I changed them to black and got nothing.  It appears that dolphin is getting its color information from gnome 3 since when changing from Ambiance to Adwaita the colors change in dolphin.\nSo how do I get the filename not to disappear when I select a file in dolphin and hover over it?\nThanks\n\nA: With root privileges, please change in the following file:\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n\nfrom\nselected_fg_color:#ffffff\n\nto\nselected_fg_color:#000000\n\nI figured this out in a long search for the right configuration file.\nI also tried changing it in .local/share/... but it did not work that way for me.\n\nA: I have struggled with the various solutions posted for hours now and have finally gotten mine working. I am running KDE Plasma on Ubuntu and a file selected AND hovered over will disappear. First, you need to figure out what theme you are using (System Settings -> Appearance -> Application Style -> (and then Window Decorations or GTK .. not sure which, but both of mine were set to the same). In this example my theme is \"theme_name\". Find this theme file here:\n/usr/share/themes/theme_name/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\nFind the line that contains \"selected_fg_color:\". Change the six digits after the : to all zeros:\nselected_fg_color:#000000\nYou will need to restart Dolphin after this change. This changes the text when you select and hover to black. If you are running a theme with a white background it still won't look perfect because the background will be white, and not look selected (but at least you can read it now). You can change the color of the background fill by adjusting \"base_color\" in the same file. However, this changes the base background color for the whole theme... so it will change other things too.\nI think that some who have said this fix does not work for them may be editing the gtkrc file for the wrong theme.\n\nA: In Ubuntu Studio I found that this problem can be solved by selecting a different Style in Windows Manager, e.g. from MurrinaDark to MurrinaBlue.\n\nA: Apologies, that did not work after all. \nThe following worked:\nsudo gedit\ngoto   /usr/share/themes/Greybird/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n    change from:\ngtk-color-scheme    = \"bg_color:#CECECE\\nselected_bg_color:#398ee7\\nbase_color:#fcfcfc\" # Background, base.\ngtk-color-scheme    = \"fg_color:#3C3C3C\\nselected_fg_color:#000000\\ntext_color:#212121\" # Foreground, text. \n    into:\ngtk-color-scheme    = \"bg_color:#CECECE\\nselected_bg_color:#ccff99\\nbase_color:#fcfcfc\" # Background, base.\ngtk-color-scheme    = \"fg_color:#3C3C3C\\nselected_fg_color:#0000cc\\ntext_color:#212121\" # Foreground, text. \n\n\nA: I had the same problem running dolphin in kde. I also had ubuntu-mate installed and apperantly it still set an environment key for qt apps to run gtk2 theme:\n$ env | grep QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME\nQT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2\n\nYou can test for yourself on your system with:\nQT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=kde dolphin\nThis will use the styles set in ~/.config/kdeglobals which you can change with the settingsmanager of kde. \nOther options are to use qt5ct but it is not in the official repos.

It says this in the console:\nCould not load image 'step1.png': Failed to open file '/home/jtp/projectnamme/data/ui/step1.png':\n\n\nA: Instead of specifying your image as step1.png, use this (relative) path in place of it:\n../media/step1.png\n\nThis should cause it to be accessed in the right place, since .. represents the parent directory of wherever the application is currently looking (in this case, apparently /home/jtp/projectnamme/data), and the actual file is located in /home/jtp/projectname/media.\n", "Q: eclipse-CDT won't debug my c++ programs I've installed eclipse from ubuntu repositories and I installed CDT from \"install new software.\"\nBut every time I try to debug a simple program, an error occurs that says 'launching q.cpp debug' encountered a problem    \"Program file does not exist\"\nAlso there is nothing in Run > Debug As.\nWhat should I do?\nWhen I type commands, the eclipse command corrector (I don't know what it is called) doesn't show me any any commands to help me to choose the correct one.\n\nA: If you are using g++ as your compiler, you should compile your program with the -g -O0 flags, to facilitate debugging.\n", "Q: Launch shell scripts from anywhere Is it possible to run my scripts located in ~/scripts from anywhere?\nSay i want to run ./scriptname regardless of my current working directory.\n\nA: Two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*call your shell scripts with a full path instead of ./, like ~/scripts/scriptname\n\n*add the folder that contains your shell scripts to the $PATH environment variable and call your shell scripts without the leading ./, like scriptname\n\nA: You can add ~/scripts to your $PATH environment variable. Then you can run scriptname from anywhere (but not ./scriptname, because the ./ denotes the current directory).\nThis answer shows how to add ~/bin to $PATH, but you can do the same with ~/scripts of course.\n\nA: Add\n export PATH=$PATH:~/scripts\n\nto your the end of your ~/.bashrc file. This will allow you to execute your scripts in ~/scripts/ by simply typing scriptname in the bash.\nYou need to logout in order for it to work in your session (you can test the scripts by opening a new terminal). \nI usually add\n export PATH=$PATH:~/bin\n\nto my path and then create symlinks to the scripts an programs I want to have available in my session.\ncd ~/bin\nln -s ~/Tools/eclipse3.7/eclipse \n# which will create a symlink in ~/bin/ with the name eclipse\n# pointing to ~/Tools/eclipse3.7/eclipse which allows me to execute\n# the eclipse in ~/Tools/eclipse3.7/\n\nNote that the path files have a precedence. If I already have installed eclipse through ubuntu, it will first search eclipse in all other places than in ~/bin/. If you want to change this behavior just export the directory the other way around:\nexport PATH=~/bin:$PATH\n\nMake sure the scripts in your scripts directory are executable otherwise the export won't have an effect.\nYou can look at the available paths by typing\necho $PATH\n\nIf you want to see all environment variables type env in your console.\n", "Q: Backup Failed - Got Status Code 500 My automatic backup hasn't worked for a couple of days now.

I know that this involves making changes to Policy Kit, and I have read a page with a similar question. However, I must need information specific to my own problem, because all my attempts so far have failed.\n\nA: If, when you say 'this account', you mean your own one then you don't need to change anything because what you're describing is the default behavior.

I have also possibly considered having two users share a home folder, but I am not sure if that is safe. If anybody can provide guidance, that would be great.\n\nA: Your Ubuntu user password doesn't need to be the same as your password elsewhere (e.g., for your email). Thus, two people who don't trust each other for everything may still be able to trust each other enough to share a user account and password.\nIf two users share the same account and the same login password, each could change the password to lock the other out from accessing the account. However, a user can always make configuration changes to his/her accounts to render it inoperable. This would be possible even if they logged in with different passwords. If you don't trust them enough to not deliberately (or accidentally) mess up the account for each other, then they need to have separate user accounts.\nIf you don't trust users enough to fully share an account (or you just want them to be able to have their own settings, their own files, their own space), you should instead have two accounts with access to shared resources (e.g., folders) as necessary. \n\nA: You should check PAM.\nResurrected link (from archive.org)\nOriginal inspired from superuser answer.\n", "Q: Can installing Ubuntu cause Windows to run hot on dual boot machine? Okay, I'm pretty sure that it is not possible for Ubuntu to cause hardware problems with Windows but..\nI installed 12.04 as a dual boot on a Compaq Presario CQ61 running Windows 7 Home premium. Install ran flawlessly and dual boot works fine. Like many other people, I noticed my machine ran very hot when using Ubuntu. Weird part is it now also seems to be running hotter when I'm in Windows. Common sense and what little I know about computers tells me that there couldn't possibly be a connection but I want to check with the community just in case.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Not possible\nBut, if you reboot into Windows right after you've been on Ubuntu, things may seem hotter while the \"extra\" heat dissipates.

I know that sounds like a weird idea, but I kinda want to experiment with this.\nOver the past few months, I've kinda turned Ubuntu into my own little Frankenstein's monster, but whatever you tell me should still work.\n\nA: Hm, quite a hacky solution, but it works! First of all install the following things:\nsudo apt-get install xmacro expect mpg321\n\nxmacro is the program that will detect your mouse clicks.\nexpect is the program that will listen to the output of xmacro for your mouse clicks so as to execute mpg321, which is a command line player!\nSo, run this script from inside a terminal:\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\nspawn xmacrorec2\n\nwhile { 1 } {\n   expect \"ButtonRelease 1\"\n   system mpg321 /home/alex/Music/notification/notification.mp3&\n}\n\nWhen you execute the above script (I repeat, through a terminal) you will be asked for an input key. Give an unusual key (e.g. F7), this will be the key that, no matter when you press it, it will stop this process from going on.\nSo, just, inside the above script, set mpg321 to a valid mp3 file of yours and test it :)\nIt works just fine under Ubuntu 12.04 but I have used all of these 3 tools under Oneiric without a problem!\nxmacrorec2 may take as argument the expected key (-k argument) as a kei code. This helps you a lot if you want to put the above script to your startup applications, because it will not ask for an input key each time. In order to find the appropriate key code that you want to use, you have to install the tiny program xbindkeys:\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n\nThen do:\ntouch ~/.xbindkeysrc\nxbindkeys -k\n\nAfter the last command, a small window will appear, without doing anything to it, give it a keyboard input, let's say F7. You will see something like this:\nYou can use one of the two lines after \"NoCommand\"\nin $HOME/.xbindkeysrc to bind a key.\n\"(Scheme function)\"\nm:0x0 + c:73\nF7\n\nNotice the line:\n    m:0x0 + c:73\n\nThe code 73 is the one expected by xmacrorec2. So, you can add to the above script a -k argument, like this: spawn xmacrorec2 -k 73 and it will automatically start. After you have finished editing the script, save it to a stable directory (I mean a directory you will not delete/move to the close future), like ~/Documents and give it executable permissions (right click on it->Properties->Permissions->Allow executing file as program, or, through the terminal, chmod +x script_name.sh). Then, simply add your script to your Startup Applications. Of course, whenever you want this sound to stop, you will have to give the corresponding keyboard input, like F7.\nPS: If you don't want to install an extra command line mp3 player (like mpg321), then you may use the pre-installed player canberra-gtk-play, which is used as\ncanberra-gtk-play -f music.wav\n\nThe disadvantage of it is that it can only play certain ogg and wav files.\n", "Q: What's the best way to add a directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

However, you can leave these packages if you want, as now the kernel updates will come from the upgraded (3.5) packages.\nNow you should be able to keep receiving updates of the 3.5.x kernel series, although you can reverse the process and go back to 3.2 if required.\nMore information on the 3.5 kernel for Precise is listed here. \nI should stress that there is no need to update unless you have a particular reason, but it is relatively simple. \n\nA: The Ubuntu Kernel team will be providing packages of all the kernels from the next 3 Ubuntu releases for 12.04. You can get the details on that here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Release/Rolling\nThese kernels will be named like this:\n\nlinux-image-current- - always points to the the most recently released kernel, e.g., 12.10, 13.04, etc.\n\nThey will be available in the package manager but by default your 12.04 installation will use 3.2.x unless you specifically install one of these kernels.\nAs far as 3.5 itself, you can now use the hardware enablement stack:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-quantal xserver-xorg-lts-quantal \n\nFor all future kernel releases, you can always find the latest builds of the upstream kernel here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\n\n*How can I install a newer kernel?\nHowever these packages are for testing and you probably shouldn't use them unless you need to or you know what you are doing.\n\nA: It is possible to upgrade just about any distribution's kernel, including Ubuntu's, by compiling it yourself. (See sites like this one or this one for details on how to do this, or perform a Web search.) I've done this for years, and most of my computers run self-compiled kernels. This isn't a good option for most non-technical end users, since it's a fairly technical process. You can minimize your exposure to the technical details by using a default configuration file -- but one of the reasons to compile your own kernel is to tweak those options to optimize performance, so using the default options robs you of one of the advantages of this procedure.\nI have heard of sites that provide precompiled versions of upgraded kernels for distributions like Ubuntu, but I don't happen to have any URLs handy.\n\nA: Open the terminal and run the following commands to install Kernel 3.5.0 at your own risk for 32-bit/i386 systems:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:upubuntu-com/kernel-i386\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install linux\n\nFor 64-bit/amd64 systems, you can install with these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:upubuntu-com/kernel-amd64\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install linux\n\nRestart now your system to finish the installation. Then, check your current kernel version with this command:\nuname -r\n\nTo remove Linux Kernel 3.5 and restore the previous kernel, run this command:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-3.5.0-030500-generic\n\n", "Q: Passwordless su in a Bash script? I've run into a dilemma while migrating a Hadoop installation from Oracle Enterprise Linux to Ubuntu. The prior developer put the following command into rc.local within OEL:\nsu reporter -c \"cd /path/to/directorywithscript && bash runwebserver.sh >> /dev/null 2>&1&\"\n\nI need the above webserver to automatically start (and stop) in Ubuntu as the specified reporter user. (The automation stuff is much less important than getting this script to properly run as the reporter user, but is a \"nice to have\" feature.)\nThis process needs to start last, as I still need to configure a couple of other Hadoop-related scripts to automatically start before this one (the webserver resides in the Hadoop filesystem, which doesn't get mounted until after you're in the OS). Every time I issue the su command I get asked for a password. This occurs regardless of which user is currently \"active\" and wasn't a problem in OEL since the Root user is actually used. Here is my current attempt at a /etc/sudoers file, but it's still not working (I'm unsure if the changes I made at the bottom are correct):\n# /etc/sudoers\n#\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\n\nDefaults        env_reset\n\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command after they have\n# provided their password\n# (Note that later entries override this, so you might need to move\n# it further down)\n%sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL\n#\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL) ALL\nuser3 ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:/bin/su\nuser2 ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:/bin/su\nuser1 ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:/bin/su\nreporter ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:/bin/su\n\nThis is a duplicate of a thread I posted over at UbuntuForums.org (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12040341#post12040341), but I'm getting desperate for an answer =P. Please note that my Linux knowledge is still weak (I knew almost no Linux before this project was dropped in my lap). Any help is greatly appreciated as this is currently a major stumbling block!\nThanks,\n-Snipe\n\nA: Your current edits to /etc/sudoers effectively let user1, user2, user3, and reporter perform any action as root (since running su lets you become root)! You almost certainly do not want this. And this doesn't help your current problem at all, because you don't want those users to run something with an alternate identity, you want root to run something with an alternate identity. Before proceeding, I recommend getting rid of those lines from /etc/sudoers (edit it with visudo of course) unless you're absolutely sure that's what you want.\nIf you're a non-root user and you run this, you will always be asked for a password:\nsu reporter -c \"cd /path/to/directorywithscript && bash runwebserver.sh >> /dev/null 2>&1&\"\n\nBut when root runs that, it should simply succeed (assuming it worked before on Oracle Enterprise Server and the only relevant difference is that root login is disabled on Ubuntu).\nWhen you put that line in rc.local, in any GNU/Linux distribution, including Ubuntu, it is run as root. It should just work. When you run it from the command-line, it will not work. But in rc.local, it should just work.\nIf you want to test it from the command-line, give yourself a root shell of the kind pretty similar to rc.local's environment:\nsudo -i\n\n(This simulates an initial root login shell. Normally, for a root shell, use sudo -s. And of course, to run a command ... with sudo, just use sudo ....)\nsu -c and sudo take different syntax, so if you did want to make that command use sudo instead of su, you'd have to make additional changes. The easiest way is probably:\nsudo -u reporter bash -c \"cd /path/to/directorywithscript && ./runwebserver.sh >> /dev/null 2>&1&\"\n\nHowever, I emphasize that you do not need to convert su commands to sudo for them to run properly out of rc.local.\nIn Ubuntu, unlike Oracle Enterprise Server, logging in as root is disabled by default (and you almost certainly shouldn't enable it). But su still works when run by root. su also works for a non-root user changing identity to another non-root user.\nIf you have this line in rc.local and it's not working, the reason isn't issues of sudo vs. su. In that case, something else is going wrong. For us to troubleshoot it, you'd have to provide the contents of runwebserver.sh.\nFinally, please note that bash runwebserver.sh >> /dev/null 2>&1& is rather inelegant. It's simpler to understand (and, much less importantly, looks nicer) to use bash runwebserver.sh &>> /dev/null. You said this runs last in rc.local, so you don't have to use & to background it.\nHowever, you should consider if you really want to suppress standard error as well as standard output (as you're currently doing). Presumably if something is written to standard error then it's either important or can be suppressed by altering your web server's verbosity settings.\n\nA: If you don't want to be asked for a password you will have to use to execute su as root,\nso you will have to use:\nsudo su reporter -c \"cd /path/to/directorywithscript && bash runwebserver.sh >> /dev/null 2>&1&\"\n\nHowever, i think what you are trying to do is a realy bad idea, you are allowing every user to log in as anyone else, including root.\n", "Q: Always on VPN connection I have a working VPN connection. Works like a dream. \nWhat isn't working though, is the 'Connect Automatically' option in the Network Connections Manager Panel. It never connects automatically, not at boot, and not after disconnect. I'm not quite sure what that option is for. And I'll get disconnected from the VPN with no warning whatsoever.\nIs there a way to make sure my computer only connects to the internet through a VPN? So that if the VPN connection isn't established, my computer can't reach the internet. And is there a way to get ubuntu to attempt to reconnect to the VPN automatically if for some reason the connection drops?\n\nA: Unfortunately \"Connect Automatically\" allows the VPN to connect when you try to visit a service that's not otherwise reachable, which means it won't work for maintaining VPN connections used only (or even primarily) for privacy purposes.\nThe only way I've found to keep VPN up is to have a crontab entry that runs\nnmcli con on id YourVPNName\n\nThis assumes you've got your VPN configured via NetworkManager, which you probably do.\n\nA: As long as the automatic reconnect is concerned, you can try this - VPNautoconnect. It seems to be working pretty well (and reconnects immediately after the VPN is dropped for some reason) and has a GUI (no need to use the command line). It works with connections from the Network Manager.\n\nA: I have my 12.04 connecting automatically about 1 minutes after I log in. I suspect part of the issue is that the VPN password is stored in an encrypted home folder, which is unavailable until a user is logged in, so it fails at start-up. So, I made crontab \nI put greg's suggestion in a new script (/etc/NetworkManager/script.sh) after a 1-min delay:\nsleep 60\n\nnmcli con up id \"MyVPNConnectionName\"\n\nI then added a crontab (crontab -e) that calls the script on start-up:\n@reboot /bin/bash /etc/NetworkManager/script.sh\n\nThis is probably not the most elegant way to do it. It might mean a user has to log in within 60 seconds of start-up or the VPN connection will fail. Also, if you do anything online in the first 60 seconds, that won't go over the VPN. So... yeah, that's what I did.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall the HUD altogether?

If you hear the scratch, raise the value by 1 again.\n\nA: This boils down to one of two reasons (or a combination):\n\n*\n\n*CPU loaded at login when sound is played\n\n*Some intrinsic problem with the Skype WAV files\n\nSolution to (1) is to delay start OR temporarily elevate Skype priority\nYou can either delay the startup, as David Sousa/Marty Fried's answers indicate, OR you can temporarily elevate Skype's priority at startup to reduce any CPU contention issue.\nThis solution uses nice/renice, and requires adding the specific command with visudo (because only root can start processes with elevated priority). I'll expand on this later since the OP (Emerson) indicates this is not his problem -- Skype login sounds grainy even when he starts Skype after his computer has been idle for a few minutes.\nSolution to (2) -- try changing the sound into a more standard format (resample)\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal, go to /usr/share/skype/sounds\n\n*Backup all files (they're tiny) with sudo tar -cvf originals.tar *.wav\n\n*Rename: sudo mv SkypeLogin.wav SkypeLoginOld.wav\n\n*Install SOundeXchange with sudo apt-get install sox (small CLI utility)\n\n*Resample the login sound to a standard 48000 Hz stereo format:sudo sox SkypeLoginOld.wav -c 2 -r 48000 SkypeLogin.wav\n\n\n*Now start Skype -- is it better?\n\nIf not, please try playing the Skype directory sounds in a regular player, and see if they still sound bad.\n\nA: Found the solution.

Once installed, open it and enable \"simultaneous output\". Then open the sound settings, and highlight the \"Simultaneous output on built in ...\". You shouldn't have to reboot, but you may have to.\n\nA: Sometimes scratchy Noises are due to a program called Skype Wrapper.

After installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my U400 Lenovo,  I found some hotkeys are not working( enable/disable touchpad, display on/off, webcam enable/disable )\nHow to fix the problem?\n\nA: A useful hotkeys trouble shooting page worth looking at is: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hotkeys/Troubleshooting\n", "Q: Is there an \"unofficial\" software center with all the PPAs? Many questions are answered simply with add this repository and install.\nI understand that Ubuntu developers cannot quickly verify all packages and make them available in official repositories. But is there an unofficial main repository or software center where developers can register their PPAs?\nAdding individual repositories is a pain and the update also takes longer as it has to check all the PPAs. Like we have alternative markets for android, it would be great if there are any popular alternative software sources that we can reasonably trust.\n\nA: \nIf you have lots of PPAs, you may want to try a graphical \"PPA Manager\" to make life easier. Scroll down directly to the PPA Manager section for a recommendation.\n\nNo, there is no unofficial \"PPA\" software center for Ubuntu.\nOne of Ubuntu's primary goals is to be a stable and reliable desktop Linux for the masses. That is why the packages (and specific versions) in the Software Center/official repositories are carefully vetted and checked for stability. The official repositories (with partners, etc.) should be sufficient for the needs of most regular users.\nWhy? : Software from a PPA should not be blindly installed\nIn theory, adding even one PPA package, no matter how \"trusted\" the source, has the potential to break Ubuntu such that it would be beyond the capability of the average user to fix it.\nThus, installing software from a PPA has to be a conscious and considered choice:\n\n*\n\n*What am I installing?\n\n*Why I am installing it?\n\n*How is it going to affect my system?\n\nMost of the answers of the type you mention -- \"add this repository and install\" -- WILL address these concerns for the questioner/user; those that don't are quickly edited/downvoted/commented on.\nThe three-step add-update-install-from-PPA process makes it more likely people will think a little about what they are doing\nThe \"pain\" of adding individual PPAs is somewhat like the \"pain\" of having to use sudo instead of just being root all the time. Compared to a one-click install of unofficial packages, the terminal-based three-step process increases the chances that the user has given some thought to what he or she is doing.\nUpdating PPAs can take longer, because they are not mirrored\nI agree that updating PPAs often takes longer for many users, because they are hosted only on launchpad.net and not mirrored. Hopefully Canonical is aware of this and is considering some kind of solution. Note that there is no intrinsic (software/design-wise) reason PPAs should take longer to update than any other repository - they have the same structure.\n\nYou can always use a PPA manager to make life easier - try Y-PPA Manager!\nManaging PPAs from the command-line can become tiring; if you have three or more PPAs, I recommend you consider the Y-PPA Manager utility. You must install it from a PPA (naturally! :-), and is available as:\n\n*\n\n*y-ppa-manager in ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager\n\n*It lets you search PPAs for a particular package (via Launchpad)\n\n*And other management functions such adding, deleting, purging, etc.\n\nSome screenshots to give you an idea:\n\n*\n\n*Main Window:\n\n\n\n*Searching all PPAs for \"vlc\":\n\n\n\n\n*Listing all packages in a PPA:\n\n\nFor a true user-contributed \"Software Center\", try Arch Linux\n\n*\n\n*Other distributions which have different goals than Ubuntu and are targeted towards users more comfortable/skilled with Linux do have what you want.\n\n*e.g. Arch Linux has a one-stop \"unofficial Software Center\" - it's called \"Arch User Repositories\" (AUR)\n\n*Any user can contribute a package, any other user can install it (after building from source), and the community can vote on packages as a sign of trust/helpfulness. Popular, high-voted packages can even make it into their official repositories.\n\n\nA: For a curated list with many PPA's, you can try Ubuntu Tweak.  It has the list available within the application.\nAnother option is to try the ppa offerings from the webupd8.org website . They update these sources fairly regularly.\n\nA: In addition to being inadvisable, creating a repository to provide all software in all PPA's is also impossible.\nIt is common for different PPA's to provide their own special versions of the same software, with the same ppa version numbers. Even if you somehow managed to install all PPA's, you would have no idea what exactly you'd be installing. This would be bad even if all PPA's provided good software that could be trusted.\nWhile installing all PPA's at once would be a bad situation, it is at least theoretically possible. However, a single repository cannot provide more than one different package with the same name and version, at the same time. So for a single repository to do this is not possible.\nImaginably, all software from all (public) PPA's could be downloaded and repackaged with different version numbers, incorporating the name of the PPA into the version number. Then a single repository could provide all this software. If this were done, then you'd have to enter the PPA name every time you wanted to install something or query information about it. This would be even more work than is currently required for enabling a PPA, because you only have to enable a PPA once (or a few times, if it's disabled manually or automatically during a release upgrade, and you want to keep using it).\n\nA: Despite all the great technical answers above. And not being one myself I thought it a great idea and think you should put it up as one on brainstorm.ubuntu.com. \nSee if it gets any support by the community that's why we have different sites\n\nA: If you are looking for an alternate source of software not available in the official repos, you can try : http://www.getdeb.net/welcome/. \nFor saving and restoring your ppas, you could try Aptik: http://www.teejeetech.in/2014/01/introducing-aptik.html\n", "Q: Why trash folder named as .Trash-1000?

Question:\nI want to run a (para) virtual machine on my Linux console server.\nCatch-22 is that the processor does not support VTX/AMDv, so I have to use  para virtualization instead of normal/hardware virtualization.\nUnfortunately, Xen cannot bridge the WLAN network adapter on my developer machine.\nTherefore I can't use Xen, as I can't get it to work properly. If I use NAT on the developer machine, I can't be sure everything/anything works on the server, and I have experienced enough to know that it's only a question of time (most times a very short time) until this will end in disaster, so I do not want that.  \nThe point is I want to be able to transfer the VM image from the developer machine to the server - unchanged.\nIs there any other (=better) para virtualization-capable application for Linux other than Xen ?  \nFor example, VirtualBox seemed to never to have problems with bridging network adapters to wlan0, but AFAIK, VirtualBox needs VTX/AMDv, isn't it ?\n\nA: You can always use KVM, it uses QEMU when VT is not enabled.\nAlso from the Wikipedia Article:\n\nSoftware-based virtualization\nIn the absence of hardware-assisted virtualization, VirtualBox adopts a standard >software-based virtualization approach. This mode supports 32-bit guest OSs which run in rings 0 and 3 of the Intel ring architecture.\n\nSo Virtualbox should run just fine\n\nEDIT: For 64 bit guests you can use QEMU. VMware Workstation relies on Binary Translation on non VT enabled hosts but it can't run 64 bit guests that way either.\n\nA: I use both Virtualbox, and VMWare Workstation 8.  I personally prefer VMWare, because to me it's faster, and I have been using it from my windows days, so you can say I'm more comfortable with it.  Both packages require that the hardware virtualization features first need to be enabled in the BIOS, before they can use it.  Both will give you the option to enable or disable that feature, but with it, applications running in a guest can take advantage of these virtualization technologies. \n\nVMware is adding support for paravirtualized operating systems as they\n  become adopted in commercial operating system distributions across its\n  virtual infrastructure platform products.\n\nSource: VMWare\nBoth packages will allow you to run the guest operating system un-modified.\nFor a more detailed introduction, see the  Wikipedia article about virtual machines.\nI forgot to say, if you're using Citrix XEN, I would suggest that you stick with it.\n", "Q: How does this [t]ricky bracket expression in grep work? I saw this one-liner recently:\n$ ps -ef | grep [f]irefox \n\nthorsen   16730     1  1 Jun19 ?        00:27:27 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox ...\n\nSo it seems to return the list of processes with \"firefox\" in the data but leaving out the grep process itself, and therefore seems roughly equivalent to:\nps -ef |grep -v grep| grep firefox\n\nI can't understand how it works though. I've looked at the man page on grep and elsewhere but haven't found an explanation.\nAnd to compound the mystery if I run:\n$ ps -ef | grep firefox  > data\n$ grep [f]irefox data\n\nthorsen   15820 28618  0 07:28 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto firefox\nthorsen   16730     1  1 Jun19 ?        00:27:45 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox ....\n\nthe [t]rick seems to stop working!\nSomeone here will know what's going on I'm sure.\nThanks.\n\nA: The square bracket expression is part of the bash shell (and other shells as well) grep's character class pattern matching. \nThe grep program by default understands POSIX basic regular expressions. With that you can define character classes. For example ps -ef | grep [ab9]irefox would find \"airefox\", \"birefox\", \"9irefox\" if those existed, but not \"abirefox\".\nThe command grep [a-zA-Z0-9]irefox would even find all processes that start with exactly one letter or number and end in \"irefox\".\nSo ps -ef | grep firefox searches for lines with firefox in it. Since the grep process itself has \"firefox\" in it, grep finds that as well. By adding a [], we are only searching for the character class \"[f]\" (which consists of only the letter \"f\" and is therefor equivalent to just an \"f\" without the brackets). The advantage of the brackets now is that the string \"firefox\" no longer appears in the grep command. Hence, grep itself won't show up in the grep result. \nBecause not very many people are familiar with square brackets as character class matching and regular expressions in general, the second result might look a little mysterious.\nIf you want to fix the second result, you can use them this way:\nps -ef | grep [f]irefox  > data\ngrep firefox data\n\n(Reference)\n\nA: The reason is that the string\ngrep firefox\n\nmatches the pattern firefox, but the string\ngrep [f]irefox\n\ndoes not match the pattern [f]irefox (which is equivalent to the pattern firefox).\nThat's why the first grep matches its own process command line, while the second doesn't.\n\nA: Daniel's answer is spot-on, but there's one interesting complication brought to mind by jokerdino's (largely incorrect) answer about shell escaping.\nFirst of all, notice that ps's unfiltered output will contain a line corresponding to the grep process launched by your shell. If you're running grep firefox at the moment you run ps, you'll see it in the output:\n$ ps\nthorsen   15820 28618  0 07:28 pts/1    00:00:00 grep firefox\nthorsen   23983     1  1 Jun19 ?        00:12:34 some other process ....\n\nIf you then take ps's output and filter it through that grep process — grepping ps's output for strings that match the regex firefox — then, well, that line will match!\n$ ps | grep firefox\nthorsen   15820 28618  0 07:28 pts/1    00:00:00 grep firefox\n                                                      ^^^^^^^ Found it!\n\nBut if you launched grep with arguments that do not match the regex you're grepping for, then that line of ps's output will not match the regex.\n$ ps | grep 'f[ij]refo*x'\n\nThe unfiltered output will contain a line like\nthorsen   15820 28618  0 07:28 pts/1    00:00:00 grep f[ij]refo*x\n\nbut the filtered output won't, because that line doesn't contain any substrings matching the regex f[ij]refo*x. (That line doesn't contain firefx, or fjrefx, or firefox, or fjrefoox, or...)\nBut, as jokerdino pointed out, there can be something else going on here, too! Because bracket characters are also magic to most shells. When you write\nls foo*.[ch]\n\nthe Bash shell actually looks at what files are available in your current working directory and expands that glob into, like,\nls foo.c foobar.c foobar.h\n\nIf you don't want shell globbing to happen, then you must backslash-escape the magic special characters *, [, ] or enclose them in single-quotes:\n$ ls foo*.[ch]\nfoo.c   foobar.c        foobar.h\n\n$ ls 'foo*.[ch]'\nls: foo*.[ch]: No such file or directory\n\nGlobbing also becomes a no-op if Bash can't find any matching files in the current directory:\n$ rm foo*.[ch]\n$ ls foo*.[ch]\nls: foo*.[ch]: No such file or directory\n\nSo, when you wrote\n$ grep [f]irefox\n\nwithout any single-quotes, it caused grep to look for lines matching the regex [f]irefox precisely because there was no file matching the glob [f]irefox in your current working directory! This doesn't relate to your actual observations, but it's interesting to note that you could have observed the following behavior:\n$ cd /usr\n$ ps -ef | grep [f]irefox \nthorsen   16730     1  1 Jun19 ?        00:27:27 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox ....\n\n$ cd /usr/lib\n$ ps -ef | grep [f]irefox\nthorsen   15820 28618  0 07:28 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto firefox\nthorsen   16730     1  1 Jun19 ?        00:27:27 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox ....\n\nIn the second case here, because the current directory has an entry named firefox, the unquoted argument [f]irefox is expanded by Bash before grep gets to see it, and you end up grepping for the regex firefox instead of [f]irefox. The solution would be to add single-quotes:\n$ ps -ef | grep '[f]irefox'\nthorsen   16730     1  1 Jun19 ?        00:27:27 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox ....\n\nI recommend adding single-quotes around every argument to anything ever, that includes \"shell metacharacters\" such as *, [, (, {, =, ,, ;, etc. — especially regexes!\n", "Q: Is it possible to install a \"For Purchase\" package using apt-get?

Can that be done with apt-get?\n\n\nA:  Do I have to use the Software Center to install a non-free package?\n\nSoftware Centre performs 2 distinct functions.  You can look up applications, and then install or remove then.  But, it is also invoked by default (as a GUI method) to install .deb (or Debian) files.\nSo NO, you could use some other method (there are many) or install a .deb package in a non-GUI manner.\n 1. Can I make a purchase using apt-get?\n\nTypically the 'software key' is separate from the software.  You only need a PPA to apt-get from.

It does have some eye-candy though, which you may want to enable. Go to the settings manager and click on 'Window Manager Tweaks'. Then enable compositing, and alter the settings for shadows and transparency according to taste.\nIf you want to go further, I recommend removing the bottom panel in XFCE and replacing it with a 3D accelerated dock.

This is an incomplete answer posted here in case someone finds it helpful.\nI was not brave enough to follow the apt-get dist-upgrade path by downgrading the system (used daily in my job). Searching further, I found a hint in the discussion under Launchpad bugreport of the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download manually the packages constituting wine by running sudo apt-get download wine1.4 wine1.4-common wine1.4-i386 wine1.4-amd64 wine-gecko1.4 ; they end up in the home directory.\n\n*Force-install them via the low-level command sudo dpkg --force-all -i wine1.4-386_1.4-0ubuntu4.1_i386.deb wine1.4-common_1.4-0ubuntu4.1_all.deb wine1.4_1.4-0ubuntu4.1_amd64.deb wine1.4-amd64_1.4-0ubuntu4.1_amd64.deb wine-gecko1.4_1.4.0-0ubuntu2_amd64.deb -- it complained with \"dependency problems, but configuring anyway as you requested\" but got the job done.\n\n\nAfter this, wine 1.4 is installed and working. However, the package managers (synaptic etc) report broken dependencies on the wine packages and the updater is not functional (shows red \"no pass\" sign and reports \"... pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.\"). Also, synaptic would remove the (seemingly broken) wine on any attempt to install other packages; the only way around is to use apt-get install on command line.\nSo in the end, this seems to be a dead end path. As far as I can tell, the only real fix will be when package maintainer addresses that Launchpad bugreport.\n\nA: Update the package index:\nsudo apt-get update\nInstall wine deb package:\nsudo apt-get install wine\n", "Q: USB Ubuntu 12.4 boot problem \nPossible Duplicate:\nBoot failure : No DEFAULT or UI configuration directive found! \n\nSalam everyone.

I need lampp and mysql running on my computer. I have installed mysql using tasksel lamp-server, and then install php with apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 phpmyadmin. And now I have now ideas how to use them. In xampp on Windows I needed only to copy my php files in htdocs directory. How to run php files in Linux and connect them to my MySQL?\n\nA: Maybe you should install the following software first.\nsudo apt-get install apache2\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\nsudo apt-get install mysql-client\nsudo apt-get install php5\nsudo apt-get install php5-gd\nsudo apt-get install php5-mysql\nsudo apt-get install phpmyadmin\n\nand then, you should configure you server.\n1, Test apache, open you browser, and enter 127.0.0.1, if \"It Works!\" appears, okay.\n2, Test php, create a file under /var/www, and name is \"index.php\", the content is:\n<!--?php phpinfo(); ?-->\n\nsave and open the url \"127.0.0.1/index.php\", the php info should appear, if not, make sure you have proper permission.\n3, Configure and test you phpmyadmin.\nfirst, run as root,\nsudo -i               #run as root\ncd /etc/apache2/conf.d\n\nand then create a file named \"phpmyadmin-web.conf\" or other you like, and the content of the file is:\nAlias /phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin\n<directory usr=\"\" share=\"\" phpmyadmin=\"\">\n   AllowOverride All\n</directory>\n\nfinally, you also should make a symbol link:\nsudo ln -s /var/www/phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin\n\nthen restart you apache server \nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nNow, you can use your ubuntu as a lamp server.\n\nA: I'm not sure if I understood your question, but if you just installed the lamp-server, you should have implicit installed apache web server.\nAFAK the default directory where you have to put your files into is /var/www/. Just go to http://localhost (or which host you're running on) and check if you see something.\nPer default the apache server, and the mysql database should be started automatically after boot. So you don't have to start them as with xampp.\nIf you're seeing any output on http://localhost it should contain a description, how to change the content. But it should be placed under /var/www/.\nThe mysql connection is the same as on windows, as you write it in PHP. The mysql database should run on the port 3306.\nAlso you can check this site where getting PHP running with tasksel is described.\n\nA: What I have understand is, you want to install xampp server just like you did using Windows.\nIf this is what you want, download and install xampp from here\nThis xampp suite contain apache server, mysql server, php, perl, and phpmyadmin.\nInstallation and configuration instructions of xampp can be found here\nThis way, you don't need to install mysql or php separately.\n\nIf you follow instructions correctly, you will find your htdocs directory at /opt/lampp/htdocs\n\n", "Q: How do I build and install the gspca webcam driver?

Thanks.\n\nA: The most likely situation is that the display output that is not working is directly wired to the discrete graphics card. The solution to this hasn't been fully implemented in Linux at the time of this writing (2013-03-19), but it is underway: it's called reverse-PRIME.\n\nA: The answer of @213441265152351 is right but it's not only most likely ;-) The DVI and Display Port are wired to the NVidia graphics while the VGA is wired to the Intel chip.\nI'm facing the same problem with the DVI ports on my docking station.

Continuing to run migth lead to unexpected results or crashes.....\n\nI've got two video cards ones an Intel and the other is a Nvidia. I typed lspci into the terminal and my Nvidia card was listed under video controller as well.\n\nA: It sounds like you are using nVidia's so-called \"optimus\" technology, their solution to hybrid graphics.\nIf that's indeed the case, you should notice Linux has no native way to deal with these hybrid graphics. Your system will leave both adapters powered on while using one (generally your Intel integrated graphics), which is most probably the reason why you see such a message when trying to run an intensive 3D application.\nIn order to be able to correctly \"switch\" to the right adapter, you will need a special application like Bumblebee. In a nutshell, installation is as simple as the following 3 lines (after which a reboot will be needed):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\n\nHowever, before proceeding, I recommend you to take a look at the Bumblebee site for more information: http://bumblebee-project.org/install.html.\nOnce bumblebee is installed, your system will keep using your intel graphics by default, but you'll be able to run an application using your dedicated nvidia card with the following command:\noptirun <yourapplication>\n\nIn your case, you want to run Crysis, which is loaded through wine. The command will look like this (assuming you're in the Crysis2 directory):\noptirun wine crysis2.exe\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Is Wine using the Nvidia card?\n\n*If so, do you have the drivers for Nvidia installed in Ubuntu?\n\n*Did you install DirectX on the prefix your using for Wine?\n\n\nTry verifying all the points I've mentioned and start from a clean wine prefix.\nAfter guaranteeing that Wine/Ubuntu are using the Nvidia card, install the Nvidia drivers for Ubuntu. Then:\ncd $HOME\nmkdir crysis2\nWINEPREFIX=\"/home/USERNAME/crysis2\" winecfg\n\nChange USERNAME to the user name, that is logged in.\nRun winetricks to install Directx.\nCheck http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=25331 for further assistance.

I want to run an Ubuntu cloud image on on VMWare.\nI just need to know how to set the OVF properties in a way that VMWare understands in order to pass parameters to cloud-init.\nWhat I've done\nInstall VMWare Player 4.0.4, using the vmware workstation 8.0.2 / player 4.0.2 fix for linux 3.2+ patch to get around the compilation failure for virtual ethernet module.\nDownload precise-server-cloudimg-amd64.ovf, and also the precise-server-cloudimg-amd64.img file (compressed QCOW2 format, 220MB)\nConvert the image from QCOW2 to VMDK:\nqemu-img convert -O vmdk precise-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img disk.vmdk\n\nEdit the OVF <File> element to change the ovf:href and ovf:size to match the output of qemu-img:\n<File ovf:href=\"disk.vmdk\" ovf:id=\"file1\" ovf:size=\"689569792\"/> \n\nEdit the <Disk> element to set sparse VMDK format and desired capacity in bytes (8GB here):\n<Disk ovf:capacity=\"8589934592\" ovf:diskId=\"vmdisk1\" ovf:fileRef=\"file1\" \novf:format=\"http://www.vmware.com/interfaces/specifications/vmdk.html#sparse\"/>\n\nRemove all the <Property> elements because vmplayer does not recognise them.\nConfigure the VirtualHardwareSection section to set CPU and RAM to taste.\nEither run the OVF in vmplayer, or convert to vmx and run the vmx:\novftools custom.ovf mymachine.vmx\nvmplayer mymachine.vmx\n\nUnfortunately I can't log in as \"ubuntu\" at the prompt because the OVF properties haven't been provided to cloud-init.   How should I do this? \n\nA: This answer is based on the NoCloud README from CloudInit and gives you cloud-init on VMWare player.  \nCreate the file \"meta-data\", using \"localhost\" as a guaranteed-to-resolve hostname to avoid DNS timeouts that make sudo take ages in a local hypervisor environment:\nlocal-hostname: localhost\n\nCreate the file \"user-data\" file for CloudInit info. This one sets password to ubuntu, and asks me to change it on first login:\n#cloud-config\npassword: ubuntu\n\nGenerate seed.iso from these files:\ngenisoimage -output seed.iso -volid cidata -joliet -rock user-data meta-data\n\nAttach \"seed.iso\" to the VM before first boot (set it to connect on start), and when grub appears, also add this kernel parameter for the first boot:\nds=nocloud-net\n\nThe machine will boot and configure itself.  For future boots, we need to edit edit /etc/default/grub and run sudo update-grub to tell it we are not in EC2 (no cloud metadata service):\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"console=ttyS0 ds=nocloud\"\n\n\nA: I have found a way to make the Ubuntu Cloud Images bootable, and put my answer\nHere's the gist of it:\nmount -o loop cloud-image.img /mnt/image\nextlinux --install /mnt/image/\necho \"DEFAULT /vmlinuz\" > /mnt/image/extlinux.conf\necho \"APPEND root=/dev/sda init=/usr/lib/cloud-init/uncloud-init\" \\\n     \"ubuntu-pass=ubuntu ds=nocloud\" >> /mnt/image/extlinux.conf\numount /mnt/image\n\nThe result is basically a bootable harddisk.  You can convert this using whatever tools you have available to suit your virtualization, and (as you can see of the APPEND root=/dev/sda) things might need tweaking depending on what your virtual hardware is (scsi or ide or sata)...\n\nA: This answer relates to precise pangolin, and describes a way to solve this problem without resorting to a CD image (which I couldn't get to work using VMware ESX).\nIt seems the Ubuntu Cloud Images now contain a boot sector (something I can't recall they did earlier).  If you do convert the image to vmdk using qemu-img and clean up the OVF as described, you can in fact boot it up into grub without further ado.  Grub has a default 5 seconds timeout, so you should be able to edit the boot parameters on the first boot to include:\ninit=/usr/lib/cloud-init/uncloud-init ubuntu-pass=ubuntu ds=nocloud-net console=tty0\n\nThis will print everything out to tty0, set the ubuntu password to something known, and force the \"uncloud\" initialization.  and will allow you log in with the credentials provided.  Note that the command line is visible for anyone who logs in (cat /proc/cmdline), so you should change the grub configuration after first boot (see below) and reboot.\nI've had success with this technique using VMware ESX with only vncviewer installed locally; no VMware tools other than ovftool used to upload the ovf to ESX. Presumably the same technique will work with a VMware Player.\nTo make things more permanent modify /etc/default/grub and set add ds=nocloud-net to the command line again to avoid cloud-init making any further changes to your image. Run update-grub to then make it stick and reboot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 login screen flickers. “Could not write bytes: broken pipes” I use Ubuntu 12.04 x64 with a dual-boot setup.\nYesterday it worked fine but this morning when I attempted to boot it gets to the login screen and then it just flickers, alternating between the login screen and the console showing boot items (mainly Apache, the last one being \"Battery status\" although it's a desktop) all with [OK] status.

After upgrading to 12.04 I'm no longer able to get it to work.\nThe printer is shared through a samba server and I need to provide logon info (domain, username and password).\nThe machine that I'm having trouble with is a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit.\nAs a measure to troubleshoot, I created a fresh install of ubuntu 10.04 32 bit as a virtual box image on the Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit machine and had no trouble getting it to print.\nI suspect authentication to be the problem.

As username I input domain/username.\nIf I choose \"Prompt user if authentication is required\" and then press verify it prompts me for credentials(username, domain and password). If I input username as: domain/username, let domain be empty and supply a password it is able to verify everything. This is the only way that I have made it to verify credentials on Ubuntu 12.04. This however doesn't make me able to print.\n\nA: I just tried setting up a printer in Ubuntu 12.04 in a similar situation.  I want to access printers on a Windows server in a domain.  Wasn't working - they were being held for authentication too.  My local username on the Ubuntu box is not the same as my Active Directory domain username.  (I may be Samba not perfectly set up.)\nBest solution so far for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Add new printer in Printing, click open 'Network Printers', select 'Windows Printer via SAMBA'\n\n*Click 'Browse' to browse for printer (it prompts for authentication to access Windows server with printer)\n\n*Select the correct printer or enter URI.\n\n*URI for new printer in New Printer dialog is now 'smb://servername/printername'\n\n*Select 'Set authentication details now'\n\n*Enter details as 'domain\\username' and password (if I click 'verify' now it says printer is not accessible, but I clicked Forward anyway.)\n\n*Select driver\n\n*Print test page\nSuccess!\nIf I chose 'Prompt user if authentication is required' instead of 'Set authentication details now', then the \"verify\" button reports that the printer is accessible.  (This is one of the first things I tried.)  But the jobs get held for authentication.\nI deleted that printer and tried the steps above, ignoring the verify button, and things now seem to work.  Perhaps the Verify button doesn't handle usernames of 'domain\\username' format, or perhaps I need to have the correct domain name set in my Samba settings in smb.conf.\n\nA: Try adding the printer without credentials, and then open the list of print jobs after initiating them. Now each job should have the status \"Awaiting approval\" or similar (My system is Danish), right click, and chose to approve the job. When entering your credentials, put a forward slash in front of your username. That worked for me.\n\nA: Printing via Samba in 12.04 is broken. See:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba/+bug/967410\n\nA: In /etc/samba/smb.conf, specify the workgroup:\n# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of\nworkgroup = WORKGROUP  # Name of the group in AD\n\nThen run /etc/init.d/smb restart.\n\nA: This is an old question, but it happened to me with 16.04 LTS, so I think this problem persists and is worth answering.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the printer via the GUI, do not enter the credentials yet;\n\n*Edit the configuration file, e.g. sudo vi /etc/cups/printers.conf\n\n*Navigate to DeviceURI line and edit it so that the URI contained username and password, like this:\nDeviceURI smb://user:my%20password@workgroup/server/usbprinter1\n\n\n*Keep in mind to UrlEncode the password if it contains unsafe characters; mine contained whitespaces, and the GUI for some reason failed to encode it; this was the entire reason for my problem;\n\n*Save the file and exit, e.g. Esc :wq;\n\n*sudo service cups restart to restart the service.\n\n\nNow you will be able to print the test page and use the printer normally.\n", "Q: How does the HUD prioritize commands?

It covers the focused app as well as system functionality.Source \nSo,in your case if you type alt and \"Edi\" and select the Firefox Preferences two or more times,then next time you type alt and \"Edit\" you should get Firefox Preferences as first option.  \nAlso if you want to experiment with HUD,you can install command line tools for it.Command line tools are available through the package indicator-appmenu-tools  \nSource\n", "Q: Installing WINE 1.4 Errors on Precise 12.04 This message is consistently received when installing WINE1.4, which fails to install properly \nupdate-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-25-generic-pae\nFatal: No images have been defined.\nrun-parts: /etc/initramfs/post-update.d//runlilo exited with return code 1\ndpkg: error processing initramfs-tools (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n initramfs-tools\nAny thoughts appreciated. \n\nA: I think the problem is due to a conflict with the lilo package, which appears to be installed on your system.

I'd like to take this into account in the user interface, but first of all, I'd like to find out what the standard way to detect screen size is in GTK, if there is one.\nSo does anyone have any ideas on how to do that?\n\nA: Here is what I came up with:\nfrom gi.repository import Gdk, Gtk\n\n# Replace w with the GtkWindow of your application\nw = Gtk.Window()\n# Get the screen from the GtkWindow\ns = w.get_screen()\n# Using the screen of the Window, the monitor it's on can be identified\nm = s.get_monitor_at_window(s.get_active_window())\n# Then get the geometry of that monitor\nmonitor = s.get_monitor_geometry(m)\n# This is an example output\nprint(\"Heigh: %s, Width: %s\" % (monitor.height, monitor.width))\n\nI'm not sure that would be called 'standard,' but I hope that it helps.\n\nA: I would say what you want is the answer to the following question:\nHow big would a window be if it was maximized?\nBecause beside the multiple screen setup there are also other problems like the size of the top panel, bottom panels (no longer in Ubuntu, but maybe other distros), window decorators,... This is actually not handled by Gtk but by the window manager. So I don't see any way to get this number unless you let the windowmanager actually do the maximization.\nTherefore the answer to this question is easy:\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, GObject\nw = Gtk.Window()\nw.maximize()\ndef p():\n    print w.get_size()\nGObject.timeout_add(1000, p)\nw.show()\nGtk.main()\n\nSo you could create a window, maximize it and then start to populate it with reasonable sized widgets.\n\nA: You can get width and height in millimeters with this method:\nfrom gi.repository import Gdk\ndisplay = Gdk.Display.get_default()\nmonitor = display.get_monitor(0)\nreturn monitor.get_width_mm(), monitor.get_height_mm()\n\n\nA: from gi.repository import Gdk\ns = Gdk.Screen.get_default()\nprint(s.get_width())\nprint(s.get_height())\n\nOf course, if you have multiple screens, this gives the size of a rectangle enclosing them both.

I am running the NVidia driver, and when I plug in HDMI I first have to make sure the secondary display is enabled, thus activating the entire HDMI setup (including audio).  Once the video is enabled and working, the sound settings includes the additional HDMI/DisplayPort audio output option.  \nGood luck!\n\nA: You can try installing program \"PulseAudio Volume Control\" (sudo apt-get install pavucontrol) and in tab \"Configuration\" select profile mentioning HDMI.\n", "Q: How to get rid of white color on white text for Ambiance Blue theme? After upgrading to Ubuntu 12.04, windows pop up with white color on white text. I am lost, confused, feeling very stupid and am not sure what to do next. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could please take a look at my issue.\nMy problem is similar to this person's experience:\nHope-DT GTK+ theme displays white fonts after upgrade to 12.04\nI see on advanced settings I am using the 'Ambiance Blue' GTK+ theme, whatever a GTK+ is. Changing this to any of the other GTK+ themes fixes the white on white problem, but makes the background colours of minimised windows really ugly - i.e. like graphics of early 1980s PCs.  Only 'Ambiance Blue' seems to set them right.\nLooking at White text on white background problem, \nit seems I need to manually edit some configuration files. There's 3 configuration files and I didn't know which one to use, so I changed them all. Now I have:\n\n**/usr/share/themes/Ambiance Blue/gtk-3.0/gtk.css:**\n\n/* default color scheme */\n@define-color bg_color #cdc3b8;  \n@define-color fg_color #262626;  \n@define-color base_color #accdff;  \n@define-color text_color #262626;  \n@define-color selected_bg_color #01b9fc;  \n@define-color selected_fg_color #ffffff;  \n@define-color tooltip_bg_color #A3D0FF;  \n@define-color tooltip_fg_color #023C79;\n\n\n**/usr/share/themes/Ambiance Blue/gtk-3.0/settings.ini:**\n\n    [Settings]\ngtk-color-scheme = \"base_color:#accdff\\nbg_color:#cdc3b8\\ntooltip_bg_color:#a3d0ff\\nselected_bg_color:#ffffff\\ntext_color:#262626\\nfg_color:#262626\\ntooltip_fg_color:#023c79\\nselected_fg_color:#ffffff\\nlink_color:#1448dd\\nbg_color_dark:#373b3c\\nfg_color_dark:#d2dbdf\"\n\n\n**/usr/share/themes/Ambiance Blue/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:**\n\n\ngtk-color-scheme = \"base_color:#accdff\\nfg_color:#262626\\ntooltip_fg_color:#023c79\\nselected_bg_color:#01b9fc\\nselected_fg_color:#ffffff\\ntext_color:#262626\\nbg_color:#cdc3b8\\ntooltip_bg_color:#a3d0ff\\nlink_color:#1448dd\"\n\n\nI restart the computer and then go into advanced settings and select 'Ambiance Blue' and I still get white on white.\nQ1.  Which of the 3 configuration files actually matters?\nI am not using unity; I'm not sure what I'm using.  Gnome 2 or gnome 3 or gnome-something or something like that I think.  Here are some environment variables:\nGTK_MODULES=canberra-gtk-module:canberra-gtk-module\nXDG_SESSION_PATH=/org/freedesktop/DisplayManager/Session0\nXDG_SEAT_PATH=/org/freedesktop/DisplayManager/Seat0\nDEFAULTS_PATH=/usr/share/gconf/gnome-classic.default.path\nXDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/etc/xdg/xdg-gnome-classic:/etc/xdg\nDESKTOP_SESSION=gnome-classic\nMANDATORY_PATH=/usr/share/gconf/gnome-classic.mandatory.path\nGDMSESSION=gnome-classic\nGNOME_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID=this-is-deprecated\nXDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/share/gnome-classic:/usr/share/gnome:/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/\nXDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME\n\nQ2. Is there some way of testing this without restarting the computer each time?  (I tried turning all numbers in one of the files to #000000 but it didn't seem to do anything.\nQ3. Exactly which number do I need to change to get rid of the white-on-white?\n\nA: These are the ones that need to be edited:\n/usr/share/{theme}/gtk-2.0/gtkrc \n\nor\n~/.themes/{theme}/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n\nchange it to:\ntext_color:#000000\nbg_color:#ffffff\n\nis the code for black text and white boxes\nI am using Equinox Evolution Midnight on Sabayon linux with openbox and lxappearance does not change the colour of the white text on black text boxes or white text on white background in firefox (also libreoffice had reversed colours, yuck)\nI hope someone spends less time figuring this out because of this answer.\n\nA: If you have not tried settings under \"Appearance\" (available from the dash), please try the available settings. There are two tabs: Look and Behaviour. Try the default settings (because capacity, type and size of the monitor may affect the \"Look\").\n", "Q: SSH id_rsa.pub asking for passphrase when none given for keypair I am trying to set up a new

From the OpenSSH ssh(1) manual page:\n-i identity_file\n        Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public\n        key authentication is read.  The default is ~/.ssh/identity for\n        protocol version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa and\n        ~/.ssh/id_rsa for protocol version 2.  Identity files may also be\n        specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.  It is\n        possible to have multiple -i options (and multiple identities\n        specified in configuration files).  ssh will also try to load\n        certificate information from the filename obtained by appending\n        -cert.pub to identity filenames.\n\nid_rsa is the identity file, which contains your private key, and should be kept secret and can be passphrase-protected.  id_rsa.pub is the public key, which you should append to authorized_keys on the systems you wish to use.\nTry -i ~/si_id_rsa instead.\n", "Q: How to actually submit my app to Ubuntu app showdown?

It looks nice, and aids my productivity because I can easily find important folders in a mass of others.\nBut then I move to another machine and all the folders are plain again.\nSo the question is where is this stored, and is there a way to have it persist between users/systems.\n\nA: gio info\nSince gvfs-info is outdated, use gio info instead.\nTo get information about a dir/file simple use\ngio info /path/to/director/or/file\n\nAfter invoking this command you will get an output like \n...\nmetadata::custom-icon: file:///home/.../.../myicon.png\n...\n\nIf you would like the exact full-path name of your icon in a script use something like:\ngio info /path/to/director/or/file | awk '/custom-icon/ {print $2}' | cut -c8-\n\n\nUsage:   gio info [OPTION…] LOCATION…\nShow information about locations.\nOptions:\n      -w, --query-writable :            List writable attributes\n      -f, --filesystem :                Get file system info\n      -a, --attributes=ATTRIBUTES:      The attributes to get\n      -n, --nofollow-symlinks:          Don’t follow symbolic links\ngio info is similar to the traditional ls utility, but using GIO\n  locations instead of local files: for example, you can use something\n  like smb://server/resource/file.txt as location. File attributes can\n  be specified with their GIO name, e.g. standard::icon, or just by\n  namespace, e.g. unix, or by “*”, which matches all attributes\n\nHow to set an icon from command line can be found here. \nA complete set of the  gio commands can be found on the gnome developer page.\n\nA: Take a look in /usr/share/icons.\nGnome stores its icons there.\n\nA: The meta-data is stored using the meta-data storage system of GIO/GVFS. You can see what attributes are stored on a file by running gvfs-info /path/to/file in a terminal. To have the same folders with the same icons on a different machine, you'll generally have to manually set the icons again. Also note that the custom icons won't show up when browsing the folders remotely via sftp or some similar means.\n\nA: No, wait, you got the wrong answer. Icon settings can be copied over from machine to machine, of course they can, there's nothing you can't do on Linux.\nIcon settings are stored in the folder:\n\n~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata\n\nIf you'd like you can try it on a virtual machine, what you have to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy all of your files from your old system (system backup) to new system (all of ~/ directory)\n\n*Make sure you have copied over the gvfs-metadata folder, as well as the folder that includes your custom icons (I would assume it is ~/.icons). If you have copied all of ~/, this would be automatically done.\n\n*Delete the gvfs-metadata you have just copied, and copy it again from system backup.\n\n*Do: $: killall nautilus\n\n\nAnd there you go, you have them back.\nI have just moved to a new computer and it worked for me.

How much I need if upgrade is required?\nLaptop model: \"Lenovo 3000 Y410\"\nGraphic : \"Intel GMA X3100\" on Intel 965GM Chipset.\nRAM/Memory : \"1 GB DDR2\" (1 slot empty).\nSwap space : 1.1GB\nResolution: 1280x800 widescreen\nShared RAM for Graphics: 256 MB  as below output suggests  \n\n$ dmesg | grep AGP\n[    0.825548] agpgart-intel 0000:00:00.0: AGP aperture is 256M @ 0xd0000000\n\n\nA: 1 GB is low but, do you know about zram ? It's a nice application to use your swap space more effectively. I would try it. On my pc this app does a very good job. \nHere is the link of Zram\n\nA: The minimum memory requirement for Ubuntu 12.04 is 384 MB of memory for Ubuntu Desktop. Some of your system memory may be unavailable due to being used by the graphics card. If your computer has only the minimum amount of memory, the installation process will take longer than normal; however, it will complete successfully, and the system will perform adequately once installed. \n\nA: I'd say 1GB is low, considering that you have 256MB of that dedicated to the integrated Intel graphics!!\nWhat I mean is that, with 12.04 Unity, if you will be doing a decent amount of multitasking, you will start to notice lags with 1GB. Eg Firefox open with 5+ tabs along with 3-4 other programs running in the background, etc. (This is based on my own extensive experience with a 1GB machine). \nA stock i386 install of 12.04 desktop with Unity 3D uses about 550-600MB of RAM after boot for me, excluding caches and with near-zero swap usage. \nSo I believe that an additional 1GB of RAM will almost certainly solve your problem. However, since RAM prices are at historical lows (should also be in Bangladesh), if you can afford it I suggest you \"max out\" with a 2GB module and future-proof your computer :)\nTemporarily, if you do not game, I recommend reducing the integrated graphics share to 128MB. This shouldnt affect the user interface/Unity in any way. \n\nA: 1GB of ram is, yes, quite low for any computer these days. It would certainly help to upgrade your RAM if possible.\nAnother possible solution is swap space. If you have any space on your HDD you can specify it as swap space, which acts like RAM, with minor differences.\nHowever, swap space is not as efficient as simply getting new ram. However, swap space is free if you have the space.\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on my MSI Wind netbook and it runs nicely with just 1gb of RAM.  \nIf you're planning on running lots of apps or have your own startup scripts, you should probably add another gigabyte to your setup.\n\nA: +1 to your answer Malte D, zram is really good idea for low RAM machines.  \nHere is a link to webupd8 site with English description, where you can find necessary information about installation. \n\nI got almost the same results on a 6-year-old laptop with Pentium M and 1Gb of RAM!\n\nAnd as for me (\"Samsung NP305U1A-A04\" with 2GB RAM), it works perfect!\n\nA: I suggest 1.5 Gb RAM minimum.  Otherwise, add a lightweight desktop, LXDE or XFCE:\n\"sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\" and/or\n\"sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\"\nIf promted, you can retain \"lightdm\" as the display manager.\nAfter rebooting, click on your user name and then select one of the lightweight desktops.\nAlternatively, install Linux Mint 13 MATE (derived from Ubuntu 12.04) if you use a lot of Gnome/gtk programs.  I tried it on a Dell Optiplex GX400 (P4 17GHz) with 1 Gb RAM, and everythings works, no crashes or errors so far.\nRichard\n\nA: That`s excellent to get best performance from ubuntu \nif you use some programs like blender or you play games then it is not good enough\n\nA: No not at all. 1 Gb RAM is more than enough for normal user. If you good performance then try using the Lubuntu-session. It is a good alternative to gnome or default unity.\nLinks:\n\n\n*\n\n*lxde site\n\n*lxde Wiki Page\nTo install:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nIt is very good if you want to save on your system resources.\nBut if you want to use or unity then you can also use your gnome or unity and increase you RAM by setting up a SWAP area. That will actually increase your RAM virtually.\nFor further information about SWAP area visit : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\nIf you find lxde very good then remove ubuntu and install lubuntu. It will save you space on hard disk. For installation instructions visit the lubuntu site. Lxde uses only 100 Mb for RAM at boot time.\n", "Q: Custom emoticons in Empathy I'm trying to use Empathy instead of Kopete, I want to have access to my custom emoticons which I also used in Kopete.

You can clean it by blowing through the heat vent of your computer.\nOr, you could dis-assemble your laptop and do a thorough cleaning of the heatsink. This procedure differs for different laptops.\nAlso make sure you have got the latest kernels and updates. Sometimes kernels have overheating/heat regression bugs.\n\nA: A few things to look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check to make sure the air vents are not clogged on both sides (cool air inlet, hot air exhaust).\n\n*\n\n*It's important to check that when you clean them you don't push the dust/hair back into the heatsink.\n\n\n*Are all the fans spinning up as expected when it gets warm?\n\n*\n\n*If one fan is not working (i.e. slow or stopped), then the temp will probably rise.  Todays laptops don't have \"extra\" cooling capability, so if it has multiple fans, both are probably necessary.\n\n\n*Can you boot from a bootable CD and use the system for a while to confirm it still gets warm?\n\n*\n\n*It's possible an update to your system might have inadvertently disabled some part of the power settings.\n\n\n*If all else fails, you will probably have to disassemble the laptop to check the heatsink and fans.\n\n*\n\n*I've worked on systems that pulled in hair and dust but it got stuck inside and was impossible to remove without opening it up.\n\n\n\nA: There may be a problem related to your graphic card adapter as well.

Getting the profile into the RAM drive might also be easy... But how to get the binaries with all dependencies into RAM?\n\nA: You do not need to copy all dependencies in the RAM, since, Modern application doesn't load all of it's function at the same time. They load them from disk, when necessary.\nYes, The system may use HDD sometimes to make room for sufficient RAM, So, that it can load another application which may require more RAM. So, it uses a feature called \"Swapping\".\n\"Swapping\" is good, since it enables you to load more applications at the same time. But it uses hard disk, which is a slow process.\nSo, if you believe that, you have sufficient RAM for not using swapping at all, you can disable swapping altogether.\nTo temporarily disable swapping: run this sudo swapoff -a in a terminal and hit enter.\nIf you want to disable swapping permenantly do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and run sudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*Carefully delete the line which contains word swap. save and exit gedit.\n\n*Restart and Login again.\n\n\nNote: You should make a backup of /etc/fstab file, so that if somethings go wrong, you can restore that.\nTo backup: sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup \nTo restore: sudo cp /etc/fstab.backup /etc/fstab\nHope this will help\n\nA: Memory management is handled by the OS it self. It schedule all the process to give same amount of time to execute. That's the basic of an multiprocessing OS.\nAlso how many data of an process loaded to RAM is decided by the application. If a application require a memory more than available memory than OS handles it by writing some part of it to virtual page (SWAP space in linux system). (Search for Paging technique of OS). So if you are plenty of memory be sure the OS is using it properly as requested by the application.\nSo basically you can't copy anything to RAM. (Also what is RAM drive?). Writing to RAM is done by OS.\nI doubt in one statement that there are plenty free CPU while the background task is running. Possibly you have misunderstood something.\nLast thing you can use to change priority of the process so the CPU gives more time to that process. renice or nice is the command. But the possibility of system freez/crash , unstable behavior is expected when you change priority.  \n\nA: The linux kernel automatically loads in-use files into RAM, so there wouldn't be any specific benefit to doing what you ask.  When you are compiling or doing other heavy-load processes, what you describe is a CPU bottleneck (processing power). The best solution would be to play around with the priorities given to each job - specifically setting the \"background\" jobs to take up less CPU, at the expense of taking more time to complete.\nThat would be accomplished using the 'nice' command:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man2/nice.2.html\n\nA: *\n\n*Start any applications before starting intensive processes (compiling). That way they will be already loaded in RAM and should respond faster.\n\n*Decrease swappiness to avoid using swap, thus reducing disk usage. Note that changing swappiness does not disable the swap file, just makes the kernel be more conservative when deciding to move things to swap. A very low swappiness will make the kernel not use swap unless you're absolutely, positively out of RAM. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swappiness\n\n*Start your intensive processes using nice and ionice to lower their CPU and I/O priority, this should keep the interactive apps more responsive.

When dual-booting my 15\" Macbook 7,2 I had issues of overheating because Ubuntu would use both my discrete and integrated graphics card.  To solve my overheating problem I had to EFI boot (see Timse201's response) and disable my discrete graphics card upon boot, using Grub2. This page provides steps for disabling the discrete graphics card. See ubuntu documentation for more information specific to your Macbook model. \n\nA: Although these answers, macfanctld etc may be relevant to some people. I realized that the solution for me was that my video card didn't have the proper drivers installed. After installing the AMD specific drivers, my Macbook Pro ran considerably cooler (50%). So if your a newbie to Ubuntu and you have a Macbook Pro with a AMD ATI videocard follow these instructions to install the correct drivers and your computer should run a lot cooler. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/AMD\nI installed the drivers using the Additional Drivers method.\nAdditional Drivers can be installed though the Software Center. This made the install pretty much automatic.\n", "Q: Desktop sharing options for Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity I would like to be able to access my office Ubuntu 12.04 machine from home, from a Mac Mini with Mac OSX. I have a VPN and I am able to access my office machine over SSH, so connectivity is not a problem. I browsed other questions, and it seems that there are several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*VNC\n\n*XRDP\n\n*FreeNX (haven't heard this one before)\n\n*Are there any other?\n\n\nI have been using Remote Desktop on Windows before, and I actually like it. Not sure how well is XRDP implemented. I also used VNC several years back, and I didn't like its performance back then - not sure if things have changed since then.\nAs I said above, the machine I want to access is running Ubuntu 12.04, with Unity. And I am using Unity by choice - I really like it and would like to continue using it :)\nThe client computer is running Mac OSX (Snow Leopard).\nBased on your previous experience what is the best setup for this environment?\n\nA: I have tested out various VNC server implementations including:\n\n\n*\n\n*TightVNC\n\n*RealVNC\n\n*FreeNX\n\n*X11VNC\n\n\nOverall I'd say that the easiest to setup, good performance on dual-display configurations,  cross-platform support for many clients, and most reliable for me has been X11VNC.\nFreeNX was very difficult to setup, though it was subjectively not that much better or faster than other solutions I tried, so the payoff wasn't as great as I'd hoped.  FreeNX only worked with *nix clients at the time I tried it, and I needed a cross-platform solution.  It could be that I mis-configured it and speed wasn't optimized for my connection somehow, although I'm not sure.\nTightVNC and RealVNC worked reasonably well for me in the past.  TightVNC was great on low-speed connections, while RealVNC was great for a slight bit of extra security (b/c it supported longer passwords w/custom block encryption algorithm). However, I had encountered some issues that made me decide to go with X11VNC.  The first was that I had problems when rebooting a remote system, starting the VNC server again on it, and trying to connect to it when no X session was already running (just the gdm login screen).  I was able to fix this with x11vnc and this helpful script.  The second problem that made me switch was that cross-platform and compatibility with many different VNC clients was also important to me.  Most modern internet connections are fast enough to give a reasonably good experience when connecting to a remote system, even over SSH tunneling.  You can experiment with passing some options when starting the x11vnc server to make things snappier if you wish.  Some that I've found are in my script.\nTo set up X11VNC:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo apt-get update\n\n*Run sudo apt-get install x11vnc\n\n*Run x11vnc -storepasswd and input a password to protect your VNC from unauthorized access Note 1\n\n*Run x11vnc -usepw to start the server Note 2\n\n*Connect to the server with your favorite VNC client Note 3\nNote 1: The password is by default stored in a file: ~/.vnc/passwd.  This file is encrypted by a symmetric key and a special block encryption algorithm.  However the key and the algorithm are known, so it is possible to decrypt it (Please only decrypt your own password and don't be evil).  Treat this file as a key to your computer, and protect it with file permissions of 0600 (chmod 0600 ~/.vnc/passwd).\nNote 2: You may add additional command line arguments if you wish, but this one is required for password protection\nNote 3: Use SSH tunneling for security.  VNC passwords are sent in plaintext over the network.  To do this you'll create a tunnel with ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 and then connect your VNC client to localhost on port 5900.  If you don't care about security, or trust everyone on your network then connect your VNC client to the host directly.\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Given hostname foo.local => connect to foo.local on port 5900\n\n*Given IP 192.168.1.123 => connect to 192.168.1.123 on port 5900\n\nA: Ubuntu offers a VNC server called \"Remote Desktop\", actually vinagre which is a flavor of VNC.\nUse the Ubuntu Software Center to install it. The server GUI can be configured to auto start on boot. I have found this version of VNC to work fine. However, I don't know what performance you are expecting or your network conditions. The various compression options (JPG, CopyRect, and color depth)  makes a significant improvement when bandwidth and network response times are detracting from your experience.\nI don't know about all the flavors of VNC to give you wisdom about which have various features that you may or may not want. What I know about this one is that it works reliably. Vinagre is accepts connections from various flavors of VNC. I am using TightVNC.\n\nA: Another big one that's really easy to use and set up is Teamviewer. It's not the best software to use if you are planning on working remotely for long periods of times. It's better for just \"viewing\". The fact that it's very simple to use and set up makes it easy to run with no setup needed and from any computer (as long as you have your ID number).\nDirect link to Teamviewer for Linux\n\nA: Ubuntu by default has remote desktop disabled. You have to  enable it. Click on 'Dash' and search for remote desktop. Click on enable remote desktop and a dialog box will open where it will give you various options to define the method of access, password etc.  \nOnce you enable it, any client machine can accesses it remotely using an agent /  remote desktop client which supports vnc. One of my favorite client which can be installed on Windows, Linux and Mac is Remmina Remote desktop. \nHere is the post for installing it on a MAC machine -\nhttp://adrian15sgd.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/remmina-for-mac-os-x-build-instructions/ \nHope this helps\nRegards\n", "Q: Keyboard / keymap problems with Xubuntu 12.04 + NX nomachine I'm running NX client on my Macbook Pro to connect to a Xubuntu 12.04 desktop at work.  I have configured NX client to start up a console upon connection.  I am able to connect to my remote linux machine and I get a simple xterm console.\nHowever, when I run xfce4-session, half my keys no longer work.

How do I add bottons to Nautilus toolbar, such as delete, new folder, cut, paste, etc. \nIn Ubuntu 11.04 I did that by editing the file \"/usr/share/nautilus/ui/nautilus-navigation-window-ui.xml\", but in 12.04 this file no longer exist.\nSo, how do I do that now?\n\nA: 11.04 used Gnome 2, so it was a different Nautilus version at all.\nTo add anything to the UI you need to get the source code and, add what you want, of course this means getting to know GTK.\n", "Q: How do I run an executable Truecrypt file from a pendrive? I am trying to run Portable Truecrypt from a USB Pendrive. I already extracted the package and all but the only way I can really open Truecrypt portable is if the executable is somewhere in my home folder. It never does when I open the executable from the pendrive.  I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.\nI have tried to go to permissions and set \"allow to run as an application\" but anyway when double-clicking, the same alert comes up:\nUnable to present media/Kingston/usr/bin/truecrypt, there is no application \ninstalled for executable files.\n\nHowever it does open normally from home folder, so I do not understand this output that Ubuntu can't find an application to open executable files, given that it opens them just fine as long as they are present in the home folder. \nI've formatted another pendrive as NFTS first and then as ext4 to check if it was related to filesystems, opened it with full administrative rights,  extracted Truecrypt files there, but still the same error returns, and while attempting to execute the file from terminal, permission is denied.\n\nA: You can try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal: Alt+Ctrl+T\n\n*Go to the directory, which contains the executable file\ncd /media/Kingston/usr/bin\n\n\n*Change the permissions of the file to make sure it is executable (if you get \"Permission denied\" on this command, use sudo chmod ... instead of chmod ...):\nchmod +x truecrypt\n\n\n*Execute the file like this (again as root)\n./truecrypt\n\n\nA: Try running it through sh:\nsh /media/Kingston/usr/bin/truecrypt\n\nAs @Lekensteyn said, the issue you are running into is most likely because your flash drive is formatted as FAT, which does not have permissions.\n\nA: If @Stefan Buynov answer does not solve your issue, you likely have a FAT/FAT32/NTFS-formatted pendrive that does not support the \"Execute permission\".\nFor a workaround, see my answer on Can't execute .out files, getting permission denied. If possible, backup your data and format the pendrive to use a filesystem that does support file permissions like Ext4. You can use the Partition Manager (or GParted) for that purpose.\n\nA: You might also type mount, and see if execution is being prevented on the device -- ensure that \"noexec\" is NOT present. noexec is an optional attribute which can be set when the device is mounted.  /etc/fstab is one place which has a list of devices and their mount attributes.  \nHowever, since you are getting mounted under media, I assume the desktop is doing the mount for you, so you probably need to find what is setting noexec there to permanently fix the issue.  \nFor one time fix, try the mount command with the option remount, exec to see if that works (ext4 assumed as a filesystem type, use whatever mount above shows):\nsudo mount -o remount,exec -text4 /dev/sdb1 /media/Kingston\n\nuse your real device instead of sdb1, and the actual filesystem type after the -t\n", "Q: USB microphone (Samson C01U) works, then disappears I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04.  My Samson C01U USB microphone, which has worked for many years on Ubuntu, now is having problems.\nThe symptom is as follows.  After a reboot, the microphone works as expected.  Recording with Audacity is fine.  Then, after some indeterminate amount of time, the microphone disappears from the system.  That is, it is no longer listed in pavucontrol or alsamixer.  Unplugging and re-plugging the microphone does not resolve the problem.  Occasionally, the microphone will appear in pavucontrol for an instant on re-plug, but disappear immediately.\nI have disabled PulseAudio and observed the same behavior.  (That is, the microphone works fine, then after some time is no longer a valid \"card\" in alsamixer.)\nThe only relevant-looking line in the syslog is as follows.  The timing correlates to the disappearance of the microphone, and the USB device number is that of the microphone.\nkernel: [63194.088077] usb 2-4: reset full-speed USB device number 12 using ohci_hcd\n\nA: Well, I suppose in a way I have solved my own problem.  That is, I wiped my Ubuntu install and installed a fresh 12.04 instance, and now the problem is gone.  I still have the exact same home directory, so presumably it wasn't a user configuration problem.\nSo apparently the issue was somehow a result of the upgrade.  I hate to have wiped out the problem without finding the cause, but I needed my microphone!\n", "Q: How to Upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 when you've got a problem? I have recently installed 8GB Ram into my ubuntu machine but when I look on the specs it only comes up with 2.8GB of Ram so I want to upgrade to 12.04 but when I try to upgrade it says it can't because it cant find the archive to update a program first and when it tries to delete or update the program it dosent work. So how do I upgrade to 12.04 with these problems?\n\nA: To use full RAM you need to enable PAE.\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-pae linux-headers-generic-pae\n\nFor Upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: It sounds like you aren't using a PAE kernel and your 11.10 is 32-bit.  Is this right?  In order to address all 8GB of RAM you should consider starting over with a 64-bit operating system.\nAs for the upgrade, you should disable all 3rd party sources, then try to update your system.  Then upgrade.\n\nA: Addressing the first part of your question, 32-bit operating systems, whether Windows or Ubuntu, will not recognize all of your new memory.  To recognize all of your memory you will need to install a 64-bit operating system.  The simplest way would be to download the 64-bit (not the recommended version) of Ubuntu and install it.\nRemember to backup any important files before you do this.  I just did the install and I thought by default it would ask me where to install it.  It didn't.  Know I have to figure out if it installed in the correct place and redo the install if it didn't.  I have several operating systems on my computer and wanted the latest version of Ubuntu to be install on my new Solid State Drive (SSD).\n", "Q: How to add a printer in gnome-shell I'm using Gnome Shell (although I'm not sure whether the \"Printers\" app is part of that or just part of Gnome).\nI go to \"Printers\" from the overview, click the + button on the bottom left, choose network and then see a message \"FirewallD is not running.

How is a specific bug's importance decided for bugs against packages in ubuntu?\nAnd by Importance, I mean 'Low', 'Medium', and other importance values on the Launchpad bug trackers.\n\nA: (Source: Bugs/Importance  (Bug Squad  Documentation))\nThe Ubuntu Bug Squad is one of the driving forces for Ubuntu Bugs, and maintains a documentation of this for the reference of every person.\nFor the sake of people who hate reading other sites, and for the few people who might be too lazy to click on the link at the beginning of this answer, I'll basically copy verbatim the Bug Squad Knowledge base information that is relevant to here:\n\nQUICK NOTE: When \"Core\" or \"Non-Core\" is referenced here, the bug squad is consdering \"core\" as part of the ubuntu-desktop package, or what gets installed by default on the LiveCD images.  This may change in future, depending on further discussion within the Bug Squad on this matter.\n\n(Note the below information may be out of date with the documentation on the wiki, you should refer to the wiki for the most up-to-date information.)\n\nUbuntu uses the following guidelines for assigning importance. The importance of the bug signifies the priority that it should be given by people fixing bugs.\nHere are the meanings of the different importance values):\n\n\n*\n\n*Undecided: The default for new bugs. Also means that there is insufficient information to determine importance\n\n*Wishlist: Missing functionality\n\n*\n\n*These aren't always bugs, but can be ideas for new features which do not yet exist.\n\n*These can also be requests to have software packaged for Ubuntu.\n\n*If it is non-trivial to implement, it should rather be written as a feature specification, see FeatureSpecifications.\n\n*These can be bugs that affect an experimental extension or non-essential feature of a given package/project.\n\n*Bugs that would only be fixed on a best-effort or outside-contribution basis might also be considered wishlist.\n\n\n*Low: Bugs which affect functionality, but to a lesser extent than most bugs, examples are:\n\n*\n\n*Bugs that have easy work-arounds \n\n*Bugs that affect unusual end-user configurations or uncommon hardware \n\n*Bugs that affect a non-essential aspect and limited scope of the application \n\n*Bugs that have a moderate impact on a non-core application \n\n*Cosmetic/usability issues that does not limit the functionality of a non-core application\n\n*Non-ideal default configurations\n\n\n*Medium: Most bugs are of medium importance, examples are:\n\n*\n\n*A bug that has a moderate impact on a core application\n\n*A bug that has a severe impact on a non-core application\n\n*A bug which impacts accessibility of a non-core application\n\n*A usability issue that does not limit the functionality of a core application\n\n*A problem with a non-essential hardware component (removable network card, camera, webcam, music player, sound card, power management feature, printer, etc.)\n\n\n*High: A bug which fulfills one of the following criteria:\n\n*\n\n*Has a severe impact on a small portion of Ubuntu users (estimated)\n\n*Makes a default Ubuntu installation generally unusable for some users. (For example, if the system fails to boot, or X fails to start, on a certain make and model of computer)\n\n*A problem with an essential hardware component (disk controller, built-in networking, video card, keyboard, mouse)\n\n*Has a moderate impact on a large portion of Ubuntu users (estimated)\n\n*Prevents the application or any dependencies from functioning correctly at all \n\n*Renders essential features or functionality of the application or dependencies broken or ineffective \n\n*Impacts accessibility of a core application\n\n\n*Critical: A bug which has a severe impact on a large portion of Ubuntu users\n\n*\n\n*Causes data corruption \n\n*Crashes the entire operating system \n\n*Renders the system temporarily or permanently unusable \n\n*Severely affects applications beyond the package responsible for the root cause \n\n\n\n\nThe Ubuntu Bug Control members have the access to set these importance statuses on bugs under the purview of Ubuntu (including packages, which ubuntu-bug will do), and can either set them themselves, or at the request of a member of the Bug Squad who is not a Bug Control member.\nGenerally, when I handle bugs and decide an importance and whether its ready for triaging (unless its blatantly obvious), I follow the Triage Guide for deciding how to triage the bug (which sets the Status of a bug to \"Triaged\") and the guidelines I've posted (and linked to) above for deciding Importance.

I'm currently studying about Linux in general and what it is.  I see that Linux is a high-performance operating system that breathes life to old hardware. Ubuntu is a distribution of Linux. \nBut I'm uncertain whether Ubuntu is an embedded system.  Embedded systems execute applications without an overhead kernel, and Android is a prime example in the mobile world. Is Ubuntu an embedded system as well?  \nWhether it is or is not, how does this fact account for the high performance of the system?\n\nA: Ubuntu is not specifically built for embedded systems, but neither is general linux.  Android is linux derived, but it's not exactly linux.  \nAlmost anything can be made performant by stripping out the not neccessary bits.  Ubuntu does have an ARM build (which is the typical architecture for embedded devices).  \nThis makes the answer to your question a solid sort of.  \nI can't think of a better way to explain it.  Hopefully this answers what you were after.\n\nA: Ubuntu is not an embedded operating system in it's default incarnation regardless of supported chipsets.\nAs @Rinzwind commented,a mobile build exists specifically for embedded devices.\nThe performance you are referring to is in relation to Linux as an operating system (more correctly called GNU/Linux as strictly speaking Linux is only the kernel).  The performance is gained by keeping the system simple.  Obviously if you start throwing windows managers and application frameworks on top then performance is affected as memory requirements increase.\nThe modular nature of the GNU/Linux operating system allows old hardware to be used where the latest versions of Windows(TM) have excessive requirements just to perform simple tasks.  As such, GNU/Linux can provide a more resource efficient system.\nDo not confuse embedded systems and real-time operating systems ... the two are often used in conjunction but there is a distinct difference.\n\nA: Ubuntu is not an embedded system.\nThat being said, your question leads us to another one, which is:\nWhat is the difference between an embedded system and an operating system ?\n7 years ago this question would be easy to answer, but nowadays the line which separates these two concepts is disappearing behind a haze... By definition, an embedded system is a small, digital electronic device, based in microcontrollers (or DSPs) that perform specific tasks. On the other side, GNU/Linux (and its distributions) are general purpose operating systems used to do important things like access facebook and your email.   \nBut we are not living in 2005, and based in Moore's law I can say that electronic devices are more powerful and smaller than before. This tendency allowed the electronic companies to install Linux in your TV and car, and in a few years(maybe months) you will have Linux in your fridge, oven and underwear (see internet of things). So, now we have Linux installed in small digital devices doing specific tasks...  \nBeside my fear of being controlled by machines in a near future, I believe the embedded system definition is getting deprecated. So now we need an international organization like IEEE or IEC to redefine or revoke the embedded system definition. Until that happens you can say that Linux(Ubuntu) can be used in embedded systems applications but usually Linux and its distributions are general purpose operating systems. \n", "Q: Computer under Ubuntu 12.04 randomly locking up when inactive I am sure someone has had a similar problem somewhere in the world, but I've not really been able to find a way out of this.\nMy install is as clean as I can make it (what can you do wrong with Ubuntu! ;)), and the computer is running smoothly. But every now and then, randomly, and only when not in use (often over night), it sometimes locks up. The computer then doesn't respond to my mouse or keyboard (where for example I cannot change the status of Num Lock or Caps Lock - the light stays on), the screen remains blank, and I need to restart the computer using the front-button. If this was every 6 months or so, it wouldn't bother me at all, but this is more along the lines of 1-2 times a week now...although I couldn't estimate if it is regular, or more or less than \"before\".\nThere should really be no particular activity running (that isn't running when I'm on the computer) that would cause my PC to lock when inactive...\nMy question now is, what would be the best approach to solving the problem? I am guessing, logging activity to look for suspicious processes? How would I go best about logging this, and if I do, would someone be willing to have a look at the output and try to help? :)\nThanks a lot in advance!\nbisi\n\nA: if you are running your system overclocked it may cause issues. I was having the same problems with full lockups and failing to resume     after suspend. I also disabled pll over volt and any other things that my computer doesn't need and i haven't had a lock up in a week, hope this helps you.     \n", "Q: How can I contribute a keyboard layout (IPA) to ubuntu? I have a launchpad account, but I've never contributed any code to Ubuntu before. I'd like to contribute an IPA keyboard layout, since it seems there isn't one already, and there should be. The easiest way I found to input IPA involves installing lots of third-party packages. If I make a new keyboard layout, I'd like for it to be available to the community, after some testing, of course. \n\nA: *\n\n*Maybe you could provide the layout via an own repo? See for example\nJawi  Keyboard layout and Font Project\n.\n\n*Another way would be to get it integrated in xkb. For this you had to contact xorg developers.\n\n", "Q: Ripping DVD movie to near lossless video and audio quality In the past I've been backing up my DVDs films as an .iso image to ensure that I have the best possible quality and that I could at a later date encode a movie/show to any format I want.\nHowever, as my DVD collection is continuing to expand I'm running out of disk space, fast.  I am now entertaining the idea of encoding my DVD collection to a high quality video files, rather than keeping them as disc images.\nI'm looking for a guide that would allow me to retain the best possible video and sound quality, without resorting keeping a disc image.  As I'm an open source nut, I would, ideally, like to use an open source codec such as Theora.  Also, an open source container (mkv?).  I'm not too savvy on audio options.\nI'm aware that some devices will have problems reading Theora/mkv.  However, the idea is to create a high quality video file that can be converted to any type that is desired.  \nSo to sum up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Best quality audio and video, without resorting to .iso uncompressed\n\n*Application to use?\n\n*Container?\n\n*Codec?\n\n*Audio encoder?\n\n\nA: First and foremost, your DVDs are encoded in a lossy, compressed format -MPEG2.  Whatever you transcode them to will result is additional loss.\nTry using Handbrake to encode your DVDs to MKV.  Use the default 'high profile' setting and change the container to MKV.  MKV is a widely supported container that might not work for every device, but it works for many.  Handbrake will allow you to encode your audio in DTS and not have to incur any loss there...  Though this might be a waste of disk space...  When you have a high bit-rate MP3 or AAC file, it basically just means the higher the bitrate, the less interpolation there is in the audio.  At 320k, it will be very hard to notice.\nAs a side-note, even a low-end cellphone with a 800x840 screen can reveal compression artifacts from the age-old DVD standard.  You might consider redoing your collection.  Of course, that would not answer to your issue of storage...\nGood luck!\nHere is a guide for getting Handbrake installed in Ubuntu 12.04.\nhttp://www.thepowerbase.com/2012/03/install-handbrake-in-ubuntu-12-04/\n\nA: If applicable, decrypt the dvd.\nThen concatenate the .vob files that make up the part of the dvd you wish to convert (they will be split into 1gb files for compatibility)\ncat VTS_xx_xx.VOB VTS_xx_xx.VOB ... > intermediate.VOB\n\nThen, use ffmpeg to convert the file to mkv with no loss of quality\nffmpeg -i intermediate.VOB -q 0 output.mkv\n\nThat's it. You're done.\n\nA: Just need to figure out what parameters have an effect on video size. For video size, the encoder (Format) and Bit Rate of the video are turned out to be the most crucial factors or reference indexes. In broad terms, the video size is determined by bit rate. Under the same definition, the higher bit rate the video possesses, the bigger the video size is. And do remember, the resolution has no influence on video size if we don’t change bit rates. \nYou can take Handbrake to compress these files to smaller videos. Select mp4 on the output setting. Then choose h264 in the video encoder part. as for audio, you can choose AC3 or AAC. And for more details, you can check this Handbrake tutorial: http://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/handbrake-tutorial.html\nand this: https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/358509-Lossless-conversion-with-Handbrake\nGood luck.\n", "Q: How to View Submitted Apps for the Ubuntu App Showdown I was wondering how to view the submitted apps for the contest.

I would like to install a KVM-based Ubuntu guest to an LVM-based logical volume, without creating a partition table on the space first. There doesn't seem to be a way within the installer to mount my chosen logical volume as root. I can do this (of course) with Gentoo. Is there anyway to bypass this assumption with Ubuntu?\n\nA: It's a best practice to use partitions, even if it's one and it spans the entire disk. There are tools out there that use that detail as part of their interrogation heuristics. I've also seen udev behave funny sometimes with partitionless drives. There's really no drawback to using partitions, no speed hit, nothing negative. It doesn't affect LVM at all as it's reading the disk and searching for metadata.\nSo you can swim upstream... or you can create a single partition. If you're that determined to make this work then I suggest that you get acquainted with the installer sources.\n\nA: Or you can use Alternate (maybe) or Server (definitely) to get LVM support and have the logical volume treated properly. (You can also manually install lvm2 before you get to the partition tool to get this, but then it builds an initrd without lvm, or did when 11.04 was current.) (*I haven't done this in a long time)\nSwim upstream: You can format the virtual disk before partitioning, and it will install, but GRUB will fail. This is not fixable because there is no MBR space for an LV but GRUB doesn't actually need to be installed because KVM provides it. The install script assumes GRUB is not installed and skips update-grub (which creates grub.cfg and maybe also device.map.) Get update-grub completed manually:\n(From LiveCD iso)\nubuntu$ sudo su -\nubuntu# mount /dev/vda /mnt ; mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc \\\n; mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev ; mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys ; chroot /mnt\n# update-grub\n# exit\nubuntu# init 6\n\nYou may be able to update-grub from a an xterm or another VTY rather than doing the liveCD hoopla.

How do bugs in ubuntu get categorized and what is a bug's life cycle?\nAlso, \"What does each bug's 'Status' mean, and how is it determined\"\n\nA: All bugs in Ubuntu have life cycles.  As well, they each have a \"Status\" that helps to explain what its life cycle is.  In Ubuntu, each bug as its life cycle continues has various statuses set on it.\nWhile this is all documented in extraordinary detail in the Triage Guide, I will (for now, as I dont have a huge amount of time to write up this process in text, but i will later) post the \"Flowcharts\" that are provided by the Bug Squad for this (click here for source of flow charts).  Each status (in the mean time) can be explained in the Bugs/Status BugSquad Documentation, but I've documented them here as well.\n(Note the below information may be out of date with the documentation on the wiki, you should refer to the wiki for the most up-to-date information.)\n\nThe following is a description of each status indicator on a bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*New: \n\n\n*\n\n*Bugs are submitted with this status\n\n*They sometimes lack information and \n\n*All of them should be untriaged \n\n\n*Incomplete:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have to ask the reporter questions, set the bug to Incomplete \n\n*Ask the submitter to provide any necessary information in a comment, and make sure you subscribe yourself to the bug report so you will get any updates to the bug via e-mail.\n\n*Some bugs are never responded to by the submitter (also called \"original poster\", or \"OP\"). These bugs will be automatically expired by Launchpad in 60 days, counted from the day it was set incomplete. There is no need to act on them (and, actually, changing the bug will restart the expiry period). Note that this applies for the Ubuntu project (i.e., those bug tasks that have \"(Ubuntu)\" in their name).

Rebooting doesn't help, and I tried installing touchpad-indicator but when I try to enable from there it says that it enables, but the icon remains like it's disabled.

From what I've observed, one SVG file works perfectly to replace a bunch of PNG files (ie. using only nautilus.svg instead of 7 PNG's of different sizes) with out a loss of quality. Is there a specific reason why icon themes supply both? I'm thinking of putting an icon theme together and I don't want to have to make a bunch of different sized PNG's. Thanks\n\nA: SVG, despite the name, is not infinitely scalable. There is a loss of quality when scaling beyond certain thresholds, just as there is when scaling PNG. Single SVGs would be nice, but the icons would still need to be drawn at multiple sizes to have sharp lines with less detail at smaller sizes, while having much detail at larger sizes, such that scaling would simply result in a different layer of the SVG getting rendered.\nThe best way to build an icon theme is to use the single-SVG workflow of Tango, like the upstream GNOME theme uses, and have a build system which uses something like icontool to split out the various regions of the canvas into the proper PNG icons in a directory. You will still need to draw the multiple sizes to have the best possible looking theme, but having all the icons in a single canvas makes it easier to maintain consistency across sizes.\n", "Q: Permission issues with mounted new hard drive on Ubuntu machine I recently purchased a new hard drive, for the sole purpose of storing a database.

I have moved my ssh authorized_keys to an /etc/ssh/ subfolder, so I can login with pubkeys and have root in control of ssh access, but there are 2 problems left.\nIt does not automount my users ecryptfs and when I manually mount it my terminal settings arent loaded, things like aliases and paths. How can I make this happen on sshlogin?\n\nA: As already reported, ecryptfs does use your password to \"unwrap\" the mount key, and if you don't provide it when loggin in, it won't work. \nHowever...\nIf you do run ecryptfs-umount-private to unmount the encrypted home, followed by a mkdir ~/.ecryptfs/presets ; ln -s ~/.ecryptfs/presets/.profile ~/.profile and remount the encrypted home with ecryptfs-mount-private. You will have a file in \"~/.ecryptfs/presets/\" called \".profile\" which will be sourced on every connection. (If you it is unnecessary to be able to tweak this file with an mounted private home, you could just as well just create a real textfile called .profile in your unmounted home, instead of the softlink above). \nThe content of ~/.ecryptfs/presets/.profile (or unmounted \"~/.profile\"), could be something in the line of \necryptfs-mount-private && cd ~ && . ./.profile \n\nThat will make sure your home is unencrypted, or otherwise ask you of your password to unencrypt it, change directory to your new mounted home, and source the ordinary .profile, which will set up your shell as you are accustomed to. \n\nA: You can't do pubkey logins and have automount work. The login password is needed to decrypt the mount key. The login password isn't available when doing pubkey-based logins.\n\nA: Actually I made it possible by copying .profile to the home folder when private is unmounted. So aliases and colors work.\nNow remote X apps wont show \"because of wrong authentication\". It works when already logged in physical and then sshed.\n", "Q: How to make FN keys working on Asus G75 laptop EDIT\nAs Tholap said, all I needed was a kernel update, which is effective for a little while now\nEND EDIT\nI just bought a Asus G75 and I cannot make the Fn keys working.\nI only found how to control the brightness (http://askubuntu.com/questions/126441/brightness-controls-doesnt-work-on-a-macbook-pro-5-5-ubuntu-12-04-lts) but the other keys are not recognized.\nI didn't know much things about key binding before digging, but I tried :\n\n\n*\n\n*testing with xev : no output...\n\n*testing with keymap : no output...\n\n*modprobe asus-laptop : \nFATAL: Error inserting asus_laptop (/lib/modules/3.2.0-25-generic/kernel/drivers/platform/x86/asus-laptop.ko): No such device (not sure what that means)\n\n*modprobe asus-nb-wmi : FATAL: Error inserting asus_nb_wmi (/lib/modules/3.2.0-25-generic/drivers/platform/x86/asus-nb-wmi.ko): No such device (not sure what that means)\n\n\nThanks for your advice\nDavid\n\nA: I have the same problem and looked for a solution.

What can I do, check etc?\nI did see this topic but my intentions are not to surpress the error message: I know how to do this (from that topic ;) ), but I'm looking for a real sollution.\nFinding the problem on the internet does suspect me to believe it is neither an ubuntu specific nor a packard-bell specific problem.If you google the problem it seems that is present on several other distribution/hardware combo's as well, and it looks like the advice is to remove one of the drivers? I have no clue as to which driver I should look at and and what would be the effect of just removing it. \nI have seen this topic which is old-ish, but describes my problem and is about a similar computer. The solution in this topic was to compile a new kernel using a spanish guide, which seems a bit extreme to me, so I'm kinda hoping for a better solution than that.\nedit: I just tested on 12.10 which still has the problem  \nOn the account of surpressing: I can surpress it in the syslog, but the IO still goes on. I do also see the mentions in dmesg, and in one of the consoles. Even a way to surpress all these things would be a help at this point.\nAnother test also shows that a quick Fedora boot has the same issues on this machine\n\nA: I tried the following patch-methods, and listed why they didn't work for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bios features: nothing I could do in the bios would effect the hotplug problems I have.\n\n*Suppressing errors.

Apart from that, the messages would also show up in the tty's, in the DMESG, etc.\n\n*Unloading modules: the modules were compiled into the kernel, so blacklisting or unloading those doesn't work.\n\n\nIn the end I did compile my own kernel, using this manual:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile\nand specifically the \"alternative\" method. There is no need for all the fancy different flavors if you just need to remove one thing, so I copied my old config (as explained), removed the hotplug stuff, and waited for the compile to complete.\n\nA: For what its worth, \nOn an Asrock ion 3d (with Ubuntu 14.04 now) disabling usb3 in BIOS solves the problem.\nPciehp flooding dmesg (\"card nog present\") no longer occurs.\n\nA: I have a EVGA SR2 and am running Ubuntu 14.04.\nI get countless pciehp messages spamming me as well.

Turning them off removed this problem. \nIf I disable them both, the problem disappears, but then I have no Ethernet, unless I use an add-in card. \nThis is very strange but it makes trying to install a graphics driver in single user mode absolutely impossible, since it appears on every tty, no matter what runlevel you select and you cannot see what you type.\nAn example of the spammage:\n[   79.976724] pciehp 0000:00:1c.0:pcie04: Card not present on Slot(0)\n[   79.988924] pciehp 0000:00:1c.0:pcie04: Card present on Slot(0)\n[   80.095809] pciehp 0000:00:1c.0:pcie04: Card not present on Slot(0)\n[   80.099873] pciehp 0000:00:1c.0:pcie04: Card present on Slot(0)\n[   80.135505] pciehp 0000:00:1c.0:pcie04: Card not present on Slot(0)\n[   80.139569] pciehp 0000:00:1c.0:pcie04: Card present on Slot(0)\n\nYou can see how fast this happens by the time and it goes on forever. \nHopefully someone may find this useful. I am still trying to remedy it without having to disable my LAN ports.\n\nA: Hit up the bios and disable your Power features.

A lot of enablement work for systems with Ubuntu preinstalled is rolled into new releases, so there's a good chance it may work then.\nSecond, I think I've seen reports about the W510 only being able to suspend/hibernate if you install the proprietary NVidia drivers. You may want to also try that if your W510 is Nvidia-equipped.\n", "Q: How to run a .pyc (compiled python) file? When I compile a python file, I get a *.pyc file. When I try to run that, I get a message saying there is no program for running them. When I search for a program online via that option, it says there are none. Can anyone help me run there files?\n\nA: Since your python file is byte compiled you need to run it through the python interpreter\npython yourfile.pyc\n\nThe reason you can run your .py files directly is because you have the line\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nor\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nor something similar on the first line in the .py files.\nThis tells your shell to execute the file with the Python interpreter.\n\nA: To decompile compiled .pyc python3 files, I used uncompyle6 in my current Ubuntu OS as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installation of uncompyle6: \npip3 install uncompyle6\n\n\n*To create a .py file from .pyc file Run: \nuncompyle6 -o . your_filename.pyc\n\n\n*Automatically a new .py file will be created with the same existing .pyc file name.\n\nA: Python compiles the .py files and saves it as .pyc files so it can reference them in subsequent invocations. The .pyc contain the compiled bytecode of Python source files, which is what the Python interpreter compiles the source to. This code is then executed by Python's virtual machine. There's no harm in deleting them (.pyc), but they will save compilation time if you're doing lots of processing.\nPython is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled one, though the distinction can be blurry because of the presence of the bytecode compiler. Compiling usually means converting to machine code which is what runs the fastest. But interpreters take human-readable text and execute it. They may do this with an intermediate stage.\nFor example, When you run myprog.py source file, the python interpreter first looks to see if any myprog.pyc exists (which is the byte-code compiled version of myprog.py), and if it is as recent or more recent than myprog.py. If so, the interpreter runs it. If it does not exist, or myprog.py is more recent than it (meaning you have changed the source file), the interpreter first compiles myprog.py to myprog.pyc.\nThere is one exception to the above example. If you put #! /usr/bin/env python on the first line of myprog.py, make it executable, and then run myprog.py by itself.\n\nA: Add the location of the file to $PATH.\nTo know the directories in your $PATH,\nuse this command in the terminal\necho $PATH\nUse this command below to add the location of the file.pyc to $PATH\nexport PATH=location of the file.pyc=$PATH\n", "Q: Ubuntu Variant / Linux Distros which uses least system resources (RAM, CPU)? I have a netbook (an older Asus EEEPC 1005HA) which I want to get rid of Windows on (I like Windows, but I don't think it works well in a netbook environment).\nBasically, my question is which Ubuntu variant will use the least RAM and CPU running idle, and/or the same question except when running Firefox and Libreoffice Writer, say.\nI am also open to suggestions of non-Ubuntu Linux distros, but since this is AskUbuntu I thought the first question would be more appropriate.\nI have a disk drive which I can attach to the netbook, so it doesn't have to be a Ubuntu Variant / Linux Distro which solely boots from a USB drive.\nI have at my disposal: DVDs, DVD writer/ disk drive, 4gb flash drive, 8 gb flash drive\nI was thinking either Lubuntu or Archbang / Crunchbang but I would like some help from more knowledgable people\nSpecs:\nCan't boot into it right now, but I think I have either Intel Atom N270 @1.60ghz OR Intel Atom N280 @1.66ghz (single core, I think)\n2gb RAM\n160 GB hard drive\n\nA: Of all the official Ubuntu variants, Lubuntu is the most lightweight, which is to say that it uses the least CPU, RAM, and disk space.\nThis is followed by Xubuntu, which is less lightweight than Lubuntu but more lightweight than Ubuntu and its other official variants.\nThere is a saying that \"you don't run an operating system, you run applications.\" You can further reduce (or increase) your system's resource footprint by making choices about what applications to run. For example, AbiWord will take up fewer resources than LibreOffice Writer. AbiWord and Gnumeric are installed instead of LibreOffice Writer and LibreOffice Calc, on Lubuntu.\nGiven your system's specifications, however, you should be able to run vanilla Ubuntu or any official Ubuntu variant. Depending on your netbook' video card, you might have to run Unity 2D (i.e., without graphics acceleration) in Ubuntu, or dial down / turn off visual effects in Kubuntu.\n\nA: For a netbook like yours, I would suggest (if you now how bash commands, and have a little time to loose and enthusiasm) to try Arch Linux with Openbox or Xfce.\nIf not, then I can suggest you to try Xubuntu which in my opinion is more similar do the original Ubuntu (with gnome) than Lubuntu (which is based on LXDE and uses Openbox too).\nJust try them and see what will help you more !\nJust for information. I own 2 netbooks 1 Asus 1215N with Atom D525 Dual-Core @1.8Ghz and 2GB of ram, and an Msi Wind U100 with an Atom N270 @ 1.60Ghz and 2Gb of ram.\nI used ubuntu a lot of time, and I can tell you that Unity3D works better on the Msi Wind U100 than on the Asus 1215N (probably because of the Intel GPU X3150 of the Asus which is crappier than the good old GMA950 of the Msi Wind U100, the same of your netbook for sure).\nAnd after a lot of Distro Experiments, I can tell you that Ubuntu is a good catch for those netbooks (even only using the Unity 2D instead of Unity3D). But I still prefer using Arch Linux with Kde4.8 with a little bit of configurations for better performance, or Arch Linux with Openbox, it will take a lot of work and time to make all work correctly but you will have a beautiful and fast (even knowing that the Atom CPU is very limited) desktop for you every day use.\nI hope this helped somehow and sorry for my horrible english. It is not my native language,\n\nA: If you're going extreme lightweight, Puppy Linux probably takes the cake. But Lubuntu is probably your best bet, as it has the whole Ubuntu community behind it. \n", "Q: Trying to install Canon LBP7750Cdn driver on Ubuntu 12.04 I'n new to Ubuntu/Linux and had significant difficulties while attempting to configure my printer to work. The automatic driver pairing wizard which Ubuntu uses to identify and install the appropriate drivers did not find my printer's driver.\nI managed to get it to print when I manually select the generic configuration and checked the PCL6 configuration. However, the printer driver wizard does provide a list of Canon printers and actually do specify my printer as LBP7750C (minus the \"dn\" at the end, I'm assuming its because duplex ability and networking is not present on all the models - I'm not sure if this could be the source of the problem), but in selecting this option and trying to print I receive this message:\n\nIdle - /usr/lib/cups/filter/foomatic-rip failed\n\nI searched for this similar problem which other users might have encountered, but while there where plenty of such cases, they all had different resolutions and were all related to HP printers.\nCanon actually do provide a driver for my printer, but it comes with no installation instructions unless you consider yourself an experienced CUPS guru.

Is there a way to speed up the Dash? When I press the super key for the first time it can take ~2 seconds for the dash to appear. Whereas if I use Synapse, it will appear instantly.\n\nA: Deactivating the \"blur\" effect might help.\nTo do so install \"MyUnity\" in the Ubuntu Software Center. Then you can disable the blur effect by setting the \"Blur\" option on the \"dash\"-tab to \"Off\".\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04LTS\nUnity Dash in Ubuntu 12.04LTS (Unity 5) may lack the swiftness and fluidity of later Unity versions like Ubuntu 14.04LTS's Unity 7, but it's stable enough for everyday use. Before you try the steps for improving Unity's speed, it's recommended to update Unity and Compiz to their latest versions available on Ubuntu 12.04LTS's repositories. This is because initial versions of Unity 5 had stability problems, but later ones received stability and speed improvements backported from successive Ubuntu releases. By the time final release of Ubuntu 12.04LTS (12.04.5) was out, Unity (v5.20) had gotten quite solid and stable.\nSome of the steps suggested here require Compiz Config. You can also use other tools like MyUnity, Unsettings, Ubuntu Tweak or editing the schema/settings directly through dconf-editor or gsettings. But, I recommend Compiz Config, coz it allows  you to edit all Compiz and Unity settings in one place. Click here to install Compiz Config \n\nStep 1: Deactivate Dynamic Blur:\nThis would reduce lag and stutter experienced when using Dash. Open Compiz Config -> Ubuntu Unity Plugin -> Experimental Tab -> Dash Blur and change it to Static Blur or No Blur.\n\n*\n\n*Static Blur causes a flicker bug with some graphics drivers in Ubuntu 12.04LTS. Otherwise, this would've been the best choice.\n\n*No Blur makes Dash transparent. As a result, you may need to increase the opacity or darkness of the Dash to improve visibility. This can be done by changing the color value in Compiz Config -> Ubuntu Unity Plugin -> Experimental Tab -> Background Color option.\n\nStep 2: Remove unwanted Lens and Scopes:\nThe Dash in Ubuntu 14.04LTS provides an option to disable/enable Scopes. Unfortunately, this feature isn't available in 12.04LTS's Unity. However, they can still be manually disabled by editing each individual lens' setting under dconf-editor->desktop->unity->lenses. But, I prefer to remove the unwanted Lens and Scopes altogether.\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall unity-scope-musicstores and unity-scope-video-remote.\nIf your Ubuntu machine isn't connected to internet very often or if you don't need these services, just remove them.\n\n\n*Uninstall unity-lens-music and unity-lens-video\nThe File Lens can still show all your music and videos, and filter them too. You don't need those lenses unless you're a real big music or video lover.\nStep 3: Reduce Dash Startup Delay:\nYou might have noticed that Dash takes a long time to load when used for the first time after booting. This startup delay can be reduced by using preload or similar daemons. Click here to install preload \nStep 4: Reduce Graphics Settings:\nIf all the previous steps didn't improve speed noticeably, or if you are still hungry for more performance, reduce the Graphics Settings for Compiz. I got this idea from Ed Villegas' Answer for Ubuntu 12.10. But remember, this change affects graphics quality of the entire Ubuntu system, not just Unity alone! Open Compiz Config->OpenGL->Texture Filter and set it to Fast.\n\nAfter doing all the above restart the system before checking the results, or else Unity may behave abnormally.\nNote that Ubuntu 12.04LTS's Unity 5 doesn't have a Low Graphics Mode like that of Unity 7 on Ubuntu 14.04LTS. However, 12.04LTS provides a similar looking but very different Unity2D desktop, which runs on a different Window Manager instead of Compiz. You may use it if your graphics hardware is very weak. But, I wouldn't recommend using it under normal cases.\n\nA: There may not be anything to do for that.\nIf the Dash hasn't been used for a while, it is possible its code has been evicted from memory to make room for something else used recently.  If that is the case it has to grab that back from disk before it is able to act.\nAgain, there may not be a workaround that would solve it without adding some other slowdown because of memory usage manipulation.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.10\n\nI. Install Unsettings. Type in terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:diesch/testing\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install unsettings\n\nOpen Unsettings. You can try 2 changes.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, go to Dash > Blur and select No blur.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Second, go to Themes and change Graphics Mode to Force low graphics mode.\n\n\n\nII. Install the Compiz Config Settings Manager. Type in terminal\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nOpen the compiz manager. Go to OpenGL and select Texture Filter > Fast\n\nRemember to log out!\n\nA: There are at least two bugs reported for this long-standing problem (goes back to 2012). Please consider adding yourselves to the bugs to bump the matter as there seems not to be much attention paid to it from the developers:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/814833\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/919801\n\nA: The dash is slow due to the extra high end graphics which your graphics card supports with much difficulty. Add the following line to the .xprofile file in your home directory.(In case its not present the create it).\nexport UNITY_LOW_GFX_MODE=1\n\nThe above line will enable low graphics mode which can be easily supported by your GPU. Dont worry you will not loose any image quality in case you are fearing so :)\nAnd save it and logoff and login again. And now check. Your Dash home would work fast and smooth.\n", "Q: Why can't I mount the Ubuntu 12.04 installer ISOs in Mac OS X? Over the past few days, I have downloaded both the 32 and 64 bit version of server and desktop to install on an Intel based PC. \nIt is normal from within OS X to double click on an ISO and it  will mount the ISO in the finder as well as within disk utility.  \nWhen I attempt to mount any of the Ubuntu ISOs I downloaded, OS X returns the error message The following disk images couldn't be opened. The reason given for the error is no mountable filesystem.  \nHowever, I am still able to open the ISO directly from disk utility and burn it to a DVD/CD.  \nWhat has changed in this release to cause this?  Is there something wrong with the current ISOs?  \nThe OS X machine I am using is only two weeks old and is having no issues with any other ISO.   \n\nA: In case anyone else comes here because they were trying to install ubuntu in Vmware Fusion, but couldn't mount the iso, at least in Vmware Fusion 4, you can \"Continue without disc\" -- then it'll let you choose an iso on the next screen, so OSX never needs to mount it, and Vmware will mount it just fine.\n\nA: This is due to a bug (of sorts) in the package used to create the Ubuntu ISOs\n\n*\n\n*Since 11.10, Ubuntu ISOs have been \"hybrid\", meaning that the ISO can also be written bit-for-bit to a USB device to make it a working Live-USB, without having to use StartUp Disk Creator, UNetBootin, etc.\n\n*\n\n*Note that this \"hybrid\" is different from the OS X/Disk Utility definition of \"hybrid\", which simply refers to an ISO readable on both Mac (HFS+) and Windows (ISO9660).\n\n\n\n*Ubuntu's hybrid functionality is provided by the isohybrid script in the SysLinux bootloader. It works by encapsulating the standard ISO9660 CD filesystem within a partition, so that it will work unmodified if written to a USB/hard disk.\n\n\n*This patch/bug report discusses a problem in the way isohybrid sets GPT UUIDs, causing Disk Utility/OS X to fail to recognize the hybrid filesystem and consequently, failing to mount it. Hopefully it will be fixed at some point, making future Ubuntu hybrid ISOs compatible with Disk Utility.\nAlternative to extract/explore Ubuntu ISOs on OS X: Keka\n\n*\n\n*Keka is an open-source OS X frontend to the p7zip package, which is able to view and extract ISOs in addition to a myriad of other archive management features. While it won't let you \"mount\" the Ubuntu ISO on its own, it should let you view the ISO filesystem and extract what you need.\n\n\nA: Maybe because they are now hybrid (DVD/USB) ISOs which can be directly dd'ed to a USB drive and booted.1\n1. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2011-June/033495.html\n\nA: The only program extracting works with is the unarchiver for free from the app store. you can repackage it afterwards, but the plan would be to first be able to load any data at all.\n\nA: I faced the same error, after reading izx's answer, I used \"The Unarchiver\" app to extract the iso.

You can only have files under 4 GiB in size on a FAT32 system, though.\nNTFS will also work.\nThere are drivers to access ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystems on Windows, but if the purpose of this drive is to share data between the systems, you may as well use FAT32 or NTFS. Then you don't have to install any new drivers on any system. Plus, this will let you read and write to the drive on other Windows systems.\nIn case it's a relevant consideration for you, Mac OS X (without added drivers) will read and write FAT32 and will read but not write NTFS.\n\nA: First at all backup all your data. Then just open the Disk Utility Tools. In Ubuntu 12.04 press the supper button and write disk then click on the corresponding application icon. After that, the application window will be opened. Now you just need to search for your drive in the left panel. Look at the volumes picture to check if more than one partition exist in your external drive. If so, try deleting all the partitions one by one, and then create a new one and format it. At this point, in order to allow both systems to read and write, you can choose FAT32 or NTFS. I personally prefer NTFS because FAT does not support files larger than 4GB size.\n\nA: Yes NTFS is native for Windows and read and writeable for ubuntu.\nExt2/3/4 can be made readable by windows with a program named ext2fs.\nBut the password protection for wd passports does just work for windows.\nThere is a quite complicated workaround: Start a Windows Virtual Machine and connect the drive to it, then unlock it and switch it back to ubuntu.\nI own such a drive myself, if I find occasion for intercepting the commands the unlocker.exe uses for the drive I will post it in the ubuntu mainforum.\nIt will not work over standard ata security commands, as they are not passed over usb.\n", "Q: VFS: Cannot open root device [UUID] or unknown-block(0,0) / Kernel panic not syncinc VFS I am running Ubuntu 11.10 x86-64 in Virtual Box.

If the cable connectors (on the cable, the computer, or the disk) are worn, the connection may be a bit loose, causing unreliability. A cable's wires could also be damaged because of a heavy object having been placed on it, a pet nibbling on it, or whatnot. Thus, as a general rule, replacing the cable should be one of the first things you try when you have problems with an external disk. Similarly, taking any USB hubs or extension cables out of the equation is generally worthwhile.\n\nA: It seems that installing the NVIDIA drivers from their website has provided the fix for this problem.

For example, I could create a shortcut for Visual Studio on the Ubuntu desktop that launches Visual Studio in Windows. I've always wanted to be able to launch Windows applications directly from the Ubuntu desktop instead of waiting for Windows to start up before clicking an application shortcut.\n\nA: This is more a hint than an answer, but it's too big for a comment.\nYou should probably look at this. According to the docs, this command, run from the host OS (I' assuming an Ubuntu host and Windows guest):\nVBoxManage guestcontrol \"Windows XP Pro\" execute --image \"cmd.exe\" --username javier --verbose \"/c\" \"regedit.exe\"\n\nShould open regedit in Windows (the guest), but I have never been able to make it work.\nYou can also use \nVBoxManage showvminfo \"Windows XP Pro\" | grep State\n\nto check if a VM is running or not.\n\nA: I deleted the original idea when I realized that it won't work because Linux won't be able to access the windows partition in a VM if it's not running already.  There may be a more complex way to do it, but I don't know if it's really worth it.\nIt may be feasible to have a common shared directory, and a script in Windows would always check this directory to see if it is empty or not.  If not, it would run the scripts in the directory, which would be put there by the Ubuntu system before running the VM.\nYou could have a 2nd script that deletes the 1st one so it doesn't run the next time.\n\nA: There are some limitation from the Windows guests but to run a guest application in seamless mode from a script that can be put in a launcher we tested the following procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start VirtualBox Manager\n\n*Log in to windows with you user and password\n\n*Switch to seamless mode Host + L\n\n*In seamless mode save the machine's state\n\n\nNow we can get full command line control over the virtual machine with the following commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the virtual machine from seamless save state\nVBoxManage startvm \"<Name_of_VM>\"\n\nor (for the Qt frontend)\nVirtualBox --startvm \"<Name_of_VM>\"\n\n\n*Run an application in the VM\nVBoxManage --nologo guestcontrol \"<Name_of_VM>\" run --exe \"C:\\\\full\\\\path\\\\to\\\\program.exe\" --username windowsuser --password password --wait-stdout\n\n\n*Terminate VM in save state\nVBoxManage controlvm \"Name_of_VM\" savestate\n\nPut these in a script to enjoy seamless Windows application windows on your Ubuntu desktop.\nIn case you have set up a passwordless Windows logon this will not work. See in the Virtual Box Manual for limitations and how to configure Windows to get it working.\n\nAlso, to use accounts without or with an empty password, the guest's group policy must be changed. To do so, open the group policy editor on the command line by typing gpedit.msc, open the key Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options and change the value of Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only to Disabled.\n\nOn operating systems without the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc), such as Home editions of Windows, creating a DWORD at the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\limitblankpassworduse and setting it to zero will achieve the same effect, according to this answer.\n\nA: I wanted the same thing and ended up solving it without using guestcontrol. On my MacOS X host I have a folder (named Windows) that my vbox client running a Win7 has mapped as Z:. I use dummy-files to communicate between host and my clients like this:\nOn the Mac host:\n- created one shell-script complete with an icon for each windows application I wanted to start in the Win-client. What they basically do is makes sure that the VirtualBox hasn't been started before and then creates a \"start this particular application\"-file in the shared folder that Windows can read after startup. Example of what such a script looks like is this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# bail if vbox is already started/running windoze...\nps ax | grep -v grep | grep 'Windows 7' > /dev/null\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n  echo \"Sorry, Windows is already running.\"\n  exit 0\nfi\n\n# send a message to Windoze which program to start...\ntouch /Users/urban/Documents/Windows/START_TS2000I.TXT\n\n# startup Windoze in seamless mode\nvboxmanage setextradata 'Windows 7' GUI/Seamless on\nvboxmanage startvm 'Windows 7' &\n\nexit 0\n\nThen on the windows client I have a matching script (BAT-file) in the Startup-folder that looks like this:\n@echo off\npushd \"C:\\Program Files\\Omega Research\\Program\"\nif exist Z:\\start_ts2000i.txt start ORTrade.exe\nif exist Z:\\start_ts2000i.txt del Z:\\start_ts2000i.txt\n.\n.\n.\nexit 0\n\nThis way, any time I want to add a new client-startup icon on my Mac I copy the shell script, invent a new dummy file and add the matching startup lines in the BAT-script on the client.

I installed Wubi on Sunday - the install seemed fine.  I was able to log in and use both Ubuntu and Windows.\nOn Monday I started receiving the following error in Windows:  windows cannot access the specified device path or file\nThis occurs on every link I click on - essentially rendering Windows unusable.  I do not experience the same problem when Windows is started up in safe mode.\nI have tried numerous virus scans (Malware bytes, Avg, AdAware) and have removed various trojans etc.  Windows is still unusable.  Ubuntu seems fine so far.\nMy question is, can this error be attributed to the Wubi install?\n\nA: You installed Wubi pretty recently. You might try uninstalling it to see if the error goes away. (Or are you unable to uninstall software in Windows, as part of this problem?)\nIf it doesn't, that doesn't prove Wubi isn't responsible. But if it does go away, then that pretty much does prove Wubi is responsible (even if only by triggering some bug in Windows). In that case, this should be reported as a bug against the Wubi project on Launchpad.\nIf you decide to uninstall Wubi and the problem goes away, then one workaround might be for you to install Ubuntu in the standard manner, alongside rather than inside your Windows system.\n", "Q: I updated my system just now.But the updating software says me that updates were installed 3days ago. Please recommend me what kind of updates are not needed.\n\n\n\nA: Most likely there are no updates for your system at the moment. Looks for me like normal behaiviour of ubuntu-ubdate.

I was able to install 12.4 without issue, except that it says in the system settings that the graphics card/driver is \"unknown\".\nI have NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200, and have not been able to get it installed. I've found the driver at NVIDIA but couldn't figure out how to actually install it. I found instructions that used apt-get to automatically find the current driver and install it, and that came close. At least then it showed up in the 3rd party drivers list. It said it was installed but not being used? And I was unable to find out why that might be, or how to get the system to use it\nTwo questions:\n1. CAN/SHOULD my graphics card work with 12.4?\n2. If so, HOW?\nI'm running a 100% fresh install, so what's the step-by-step from there?\n\nA: Gonna answer my own question: NO YOU CAN'T INSTALL LEGACY NVIDIA DRIVER (173.14.XX) ON \nA 32bit INSTALL. They're just not compatible with the new Xorg system. There are rumors of an update in the future, and if I understand correctly there may already be a 64bit one released. But for now, the only solution (not a solution, more like a compromise) is to downgrade Xorg.\nEDIT:\nThey've now released an updated driver for 32bit systems, 173.14.35. You can grab it from the launchpad site (https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-173-updates/173.14.35-0ubuntu1/+build/3597638).

You can confirm by typing in nvidia-settings into Terminal and launching that or by launching Additional Drivers from the Dash Home menu.\nIf you haven't already installed 'nvidia-current', the instructions are as follows:\nGo into Terminal and enter:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n\nthen\nsudo apt-get update\n\nand finally,\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nYou'll have to restart after this.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I'm using an Nvidia Quadro 600 and since I was frustrated that I couldn't get a 120hz 1080p resolution option with the GUI installed nvidia-current drivers, I decided to use the above mentioned APT method (listed on a different site) to install the 302.17 drivers for the Quadro 600, which of course broke X due to being an unsupported driver and on my system Nouveau was removed (by the nvidia install?).\nSo I had nothing to fall back on. \nI suggest that if you are using a Nvidia driver, you only use the driver specified by the additional hardware in the GUI and avoid using the APT method unless you have compared the driver versions from the PPA and have verified that you are indeed installing the correct driver. \nAs a noob, I was unable to remove the incorrect modules with the command line which resulted in a fresh install with no Nvidia card attached, then shutdown, install the Nvidia card and use the GUI to add the nvidia-current drivers to get 1080p and everything works. (I'm sure there was a better/easier/faster way but this was all I could figure out by myself).\n\nA: Nvidia's updated 173.14.35 driver for the FX5200 is now available through the jockey application or \"Additional Drivers\".\nIn Xubuntu 12.04 I use: Menu > Settings > Additional Drivers. This opens a GUI listing the drivers available for the video card. Select the recommended proprietary driver. You'll have to reboot the system after changing the video driver to activate it; I always just shut it down and do a cold-boot.\n", "Q: Why does Compiz crash on the Ubuntu host when opening Windows 7 in Virtualbox? I opened a Windows 7 virtual machine tonight from VirtualBox, and compiz crashed, resulting in me thinking for about a minute that my laptop had frozen, but it came back with a compiz crash after it restarted and offered me to file a bug report. It was fine when it came back.\nApparently, I can't file a bug report because precise is out of beta. Should I panic?\n\nA: You can reconfigure Apport to report bugs from crashes. If you're willing to submit a good bug report, that may shed light on the problem and/or get it fixed.\nCompiz is your window manager. When it crashes, you don't generally lose data from any applications. So no, you needn't worry.\nIf you want, you can switch to Unity 2D (select Ubuntu 2D instead of Ubuntu at the login screen, by expanding the session type drop-down menu, which looks like a circle with the Ubuntu icon in it). Unity 2D uses Metacity rather than Compiz, so that will make this crash go away.\n", "Q: Way to make Shotwell use ffmpegthumbnailer instead of Totem for thumbnails? Totem never works right in my experience. My latest problem is that totem will not display some video Thumbnails. I fixed the problem by installing ffmpegthumbnailer and using this to generate thumbnails. But unfortunately it appears to have only fixed the problem within Nautilus. Shotwell, it seems, is still relying on Totem for its thumbnails because all the same videos that Totem wouldn't show Thumbnails for, Shotwell still won't either--even though Nautilus is now showing thumbnails for them because of ffmpegthumbnailer.\nHow do I get Shotwell to use ffmpegthumbnailer instead of Totem for video thumbnails?\n\nA: Shotwell 0.9.x uses Totem for video thumbnailing, but that was dropped as of Shotwell 0.10 in favor of shotwell-video-thumbnailer.  Chances are, upgrading to a more recent version will solve your problem.\nAs for ffmpegthumbnailer, you'd have to edit the Shotwell code to add support for it.  The place to look would be in VideoSupport.vala in the thumbnailer() method.  That said, duplicate detection relies on video thumbnails -- something to keep in mind if you have an existing Shotwell database.\n\nA: This question has been around for some time, but it does also matter today, because some Linux distributions have licensing issues on this and it might be easier to use ffmpeg. I found, that renaming \n/usr/bin/shotwell-video-thumbnailer to /usr/bin/shotwell-video-thumbnailer-original and creating a new file \n/usr/bin/shotwell-video-thumbnailer with:\n\n#!/bin/sh\n# ffmpegthumbnailer -i \"$*\" -c png -s320-1 -o-\nffmpeg -threads 2 -loglevel error -y -skip_frame noref -ss 00:00:10 -i \"$*\"  -\nfilter_complex \"thumbnail=100,scale=720:-1\" -frames:v 1 -f image2 -\n\nin it and making that executable by calling chmod +x /usr/bin/shotwell-video-thumbnailer does the trick.\nYou can either use ffmpegthumbnailer or the ffmpeg line depending on your personal preferences by moving the # from before ffmpegthumbnailer to before ffmpeg . I found ffmpeg to be faster and that's what the script in it's current form runs.\n\nA: GStreamer itself would be just fine, but there are still problems in how Shotwell uses it that I've described at bug #1406546. The bug includes information about my PPA for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS users that has an upgraded package using ffmpegthumbnailer.\n", "Q: Windows 7/ 12.04 Dual Boot Mess I am new to Ubuntu and to Linux in general.\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 to a brand new desktop which had Windows 7 pre-installed, and am dual-booting between them.\nBoth operating systems work well.\nThen I tried to change the order of the boot menu to make Ubuntu first and Windows 7 second. I did this from the windows side (it seems that my setup is relying on the Windows boot loader, which I don't think I need to change) using the built-in startup manager (I think that's what windows calls it- it's in the control panel).\nI set Ubuntu as first (default if no user input).\nThen I accidentally (\"hmmm...I wonder what this button does?\") set the menu timeout to 0.\nNow, I cannot change the menu timeout (because I cannot get into Windows) and without doing so, I cannot select Windows as the OS I would like to boot (I cannot get into windows).\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: The information you've provided indicates that you have installed Ubuntu inside Windows with Wubi. Therefore, the boot loader whose menu you're not seeing is the Windows boot loader, and not GRUB (Ubuntu's boot loader).\nYou should be able to get the Windows boot menu to appear by pressing F8 while booting.\n(If you had a similar problem, where you set Ubuntu's boot loader timeout to 0, then you would instead hold down Shift while booting.)\n", "Q: How to permanently disable user switching in Gnome 3?

Any location that doesn't have a -P between it and the previous path (or the command name [scp]) defaults to the standard port (22).\n\nA: You can use ~/.ssh/config to specify the ports to use for the hosts (and for setting many other nice things; check the man page man ssh_config):\n# ~/.ssh/config\n\nHost 67.12.21.133\n  Port 6774\n\nHost 67.129.242.40\n  Port 6774\n\nWhen doing this, you have to use the option -3 to scp, which copies the files through your local machine. Otherwise, scp issues the scp command via ssh on the first host, so it actually runs \n ssh -p 6774 denny@67.12.21.133 scp -rp /home/denny/testapp1.txt denny@67.129.242.40:\n\nand then the ~/.ssh/config of the first remote host (67.12.21.133) is used instead of your local one. \nWhen you have setup your ~/.ssh/config correctly, this should work:\nscp -rp3 denny@67.12.21.133:/home/denny/testapp1.txt denny@67.129.242.40:\n\nOf course, you can also copy the contents of the ~/.ssh/config file onto your first remote host, and then you can use scp without the -3 option, which will probably speeden up the transfer.\nOr you can use the trick that scp uses and use such a command line:\nssh -p 6774 denny@67.12.21.133 scp -rp -P 6774 /home/denny/testapp1.txt denny@67.129.242.40:\n\n(Note the different case of the port parameter for ssh and scp: ssh -p 6774 vs. scp -P 6774)\nPS: I got this information from the OpenSSH bugzilla where I entered this as a bug: https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2020\n\nA: A method working with the current version of OpenSSH is specifying the ports in the source and target URLs:\nscp -3 scp://host1:port1//path/to/file  scp://host2:port2//path/to/file\n\n\nA: If you need to transfer data from one server to another, use the SCP command.  To do so Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

Then, if you cat /proc/$PPID/comm, you echo the command name of the PID\n\n\nCheck man proc\n\nA: Using pstree by command name\nUsing pstree you can search by the child process name and get the Process ID (PID) along with the parents, grandparents and any children of the child process:\n$ pstree -hp | grep sleep\n           |-cron(763)---cron(795)---sh(839)---display-auto-br(841)---sleep(8414)\n\nIn this case sleep is the child command and it's PID is 8414. It's parent ID is 841 and is called display-auto-brightness. The grandparent is a shell (sh) with a process ID of 839. The great-grandparent is cron with a process ID of 795. The great-great-grandparent is also cron with a process ID of 763.\nIf you want to search by Process ID of sleep instead of name you can use:\n$ pstree -hp | grep 14653\n           |-cron(763)---cron(795)---sh(839)---display-auto-br(841)---sleep(14653)\n\nNotice the sleep process ID changed to 14653. The parent (PID 841) sleeps for 1 minute, wakes up for a split second and then starts a new sleep command which gets a new process ID. This is another reason why searching for sleep is easier than searching by process ID.\nThis code was taken from: Automatically adjust display brightness based on sunrise and sunset and adapted to this question.\n\nTo see a nested chain all the way back to boot process use the PID instead of name:\n$ pstree -aps 8541\nsystemd,1 splash fastboot kaslr\n  └─cron,763 -f\n      └─cron,795 -f\n          └─sh,839 -c    /usr/local/bin/display-auto-brightness\n              └─display-auto-br,841 /usr/local/bin/display-auto-brightness\n                  └─sleep,8541 60\n\nNote: Another minute has passed and the sleep command gets a new PID (8541).\n\nA: How to get a parent PID (PPID) from a child's process ID (PID) using the command-line\nUse ps -o ppid=\n\n\n*\n\n*e.g. ps -o ppid= 2072 returns 2061, which you can easily use in a script etc. ps -o ppid= -C foo gives the PPID of process with command foo.

I want to resize my partitions: I have 3 partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.04\n\n*Windows Seven\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10\n\n\nIt's booting with the boot installed by the Ubuntu 11.10 version.\nI want to expand (only expand) all the 3 partitions.\nMy HD is 1,8 Tb so it's big and I have no possibility to save before expanding.\nSo my question is: if you tell me GParted work 99,99 % of the time, I'm willing to take the risk. If you tell me GParted work 90 % of the time, I won't take that risk.\n\nA: My experience with resizing partions in GParted in 100% positive. Some basic rules apply, as has been mentioned above:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have backup. (That's always a basic rule, not just when you're resizing partions :-)).\n\n*Make sure your partitions are error free and unmounted cleanly. Specifically, on your dual-boot system, make sure Windows has been shut down correctly before you change anything on your partitions.\n\n\nA: I have partitioned and re-partitioned, edited and re-sized my Hard Drive numerous times with GParted and it has never failed me. As medigeek said there is no such thing as a guarantee in these programs.  \nYou should always take a back-up of all valuable data to be on the safe side.\n\nA: I personally did not have a problem. I resized my disks using gparted, ntfs and fat32 and ext4. About 8-10 times until now. It should be safe, otherwise you would see problems such as \"gparted broke my disk\" all around the web.\nThe way I see it, it wouldn't be in the ubuntu distribution if it wasn't doing its job 99%. It's a well-established program with a good programmer, well-maintained and supported regularly (by closing/fixing bugs). :)\nOf course, if you are afraid of losing your data, you can always buy or ask from someone to lend you a hard drive, usb or sata, so that you can backup your important data first.\nAs mentioned in the comments, use a livecd with gparted (e.g. ubuntu 12.04 livecd), let it do its job and don't interfere. Also, don't do a lot of steps as a batch job (don't put a lot of stuff to do in the gparted queue). Do them one-by-one and hit apply.\nThere's only one risky situation, if the power goes down, as per Anwar's comment:\n\nThere is nothing as 99.99% guarantee. Sudden power failure can also\n  cause you a big metal plate, with no uses. Also note that: As per my\n  knowledge, All partitioning tools are dangerous. They always warn\n  their users about that\n\n\nA: I have used gparted safely on ext[234], fat32 and NTFS partitions. I guess from your question that you don't have any backup of your data, so you have accepted the risk of losing your data if a disk fails, you spill a cup of tea over it etc. In that case the additional risk caused by using gparted feels negligible.\nIf you can afford an external hard-drive I'd suggest you back up, not matter if you use gparted or not.\n\nA: I've worked on lots of partitions with GParted for many years. 99% of the time this is working, but I also had two bad experiences:\nOnce I extended an XFS partition on a virtual SLES12 machine. Everything seemed to work without any error message. Approx. 24 hour later the XFS filesystem completely crashed.  I was able to repair it, but did not trust it anymore and copied the files to another disk.\nBefore this expansion the VM worked for many months without any problem. All other VMs on this ESXi machine and on the same 3PAR storage are working as well without problems. \nTo be sure I also did a f3write test on the \"defective\" virtual disk after the xfsrepair just to be sure that there is no data corruption problem with the storage system. I'm very sure that neither the ESXi hypervisor nor the SAN was responsible for the crash of the FS. Otherwise I would have had lots of other problems on this cluster the following months, which I had not.\nI also do not recommend to extend a windows/ntfs partition with GParted!\nI extended the main partition of my Windows 2012 Server (running Exchange) with GParted. This partition was also the last one on the drive and so the task seemed very simple. I powered it down, extended the disk in ESXi, booted systemrescuecd-6.0.1.iso, and did the extension of the ntfs partition and filesystem with Gparted. Everything seemed to work without error. I could also boot the machine with no problems.\nBUT when Veeam wanted to do the daily backup afterwards it failed:\nEvent description: Job \"nameofjob\" finished with error. Processing EXCHANGE Error: VSSControl: -2147467259 Backup job failed. Cannot create a shadow copy of the volumes containing writer's data. VSS asynchronous operation is not completed. Operation: [Shadow copies commit]. Code: [0x8004231f].\n\nEXCHANGE - Failed to prepare guest for hot backup. Error: VSSControl: -2147467259 Backup job failed. Cannot create a shadow copy of the volumes containing writer''s data. VSS asynchronous operation is not completed. Operation: [Shadow copies commit]. Code: [0x8004231f].\n\nI've tried tons of things to repair the VSS writer functionality with no success. So I restored the VM from a backup I did before. Then I did the expansion again with plain Windows Disk Management. This time everything worked fine. Also VSS writers are working flawless.\n", "Q: Why is my LibreOffice so slow? Every time I start LibreOffice, I have to wait 3 minutes before I'm able to start working (screen is grey). Why? Are there any ways to fix this problem?\nRegrets\nMalte \n\nA: How you can see here LibreOffice won't work well with ALL Java versions. The 1.6.0_21 seems to be the best java to use with LibreOffice. The 1.6.0_20 & 1.6.0_22 seem to be in a fairly good 2nd place place. The 1.6.0_24 was really bad and the 1.6.0_26 was even worse apparently.\nTo install 1.6.0_21 You should first purge every other Java versions from your system (icedtea, open, ecc. all included). \nUnfortunately, it seems near impossible to find compiled packages for precise, so you'll have to consider to build it from source (https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sun-java6/6.21-1ubuntu1). \nOtherwise, you could disable java plugin for LO, from Tools menu, then Options, Java, uncheck the box.\nLast alternative, install other versions of java (such as the last Oracle 1.7) and select it in the list, to see if the problem solves.\n\nA: This past week, LO slowed considerably for me, no matter what document. Don't know if it was a change in Java, but LO became unusable in terms of entering numbers in Calc or even typing in Writer. \nThis is under 14.04 64-bit w/ 8GB of RAM. \nLO Version: 4.2.7.2, Build ID: 420m0(Build:2)\nAs mentioned above, turning off use of the Java runtime environment: Tools>Options>Advanced within LO, and restarting LO seems to have solved the problem, both for Calc and for Writer.\n", "Q: What BIOS settings must I change on a Compaq dc5750 small form factor to install Ubuntu?

I also installed gtk-redshift and f.lux.\nI checked Additional Drivers to see if there is something I can install but it didn't find anything. I tried to Google it but I didn't find anything about a monitor stopping being recognized after it was already working.

I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04, which I had been booting from a usb key, as a dual-boot on my machine running Windows 7. From what I had read online while researching, I was prepared to have to shrink the Windows partition and all that. But I never had to - it really was just a few clicks here and there and it was installed. I'm still pretty confused about it, but whatever, it worked, and the two peacefully coexist on my machine, and I have broken things to fix before I worry about fixing unbroken things.\nSo yesterday I got it in my head to look at my partitions (I was considering making an all new partition to install the Windows 8 Release Preview). What I saw confused me. Here's a screenshot of the disk utility. At this moment, there is nothing connected to my computer, and nothing in any of the optical drives/ports/card readers/etc.\n\nCan you help me figure out what's going on here?\nDon's Machine is, I believe, my Windows partition - that's the name I assigned my machine from Windows Explorer.\nPQSERVICE is from what I can find online also Windows, but having to do with backup.\nAnd SYSTEM REQUIRED, if I browse it in Ubuntu, is definitely something to do with booting, and I believe it is also Windows'.\nAccording to the sizes shown, those three together should use up my 500 GB HD.\nThen further down, as a \"peripheral device\", it lists that 31 GB disk. This is obviously my Ubuntu (Model:Linux Loop:root.disk), but why is it showing up as a peripheral?\nSo, to sum up those questions and to add some more random ones I had:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is Ubuntu showing up as a peripheral device?\n\n*If the Windows sections take up all 500 GB, where does Ubuntu live?\n\n*If I renamed the disk partitions, would my life become a nightmare (seriously - can I safely rename them)?\n\n*Why didn't I have to resize the Windows partition in the first place?\n\n*Would giving Ubuntu more space improve its performance (it hangs alot)?\n\n*Is it possible to have a partition for each OS (Windows 7 & 8, Ubuntu), a partition for files, and a separate partition for backups? Is this towards the good or bad idea end of the spectrum?\n\n\n@Elfy, would that explain why it keeps hanging? I guess I'll backup my files, rip it out, and reinstall it correctly later on today.\n@Takkat:\nRather than bother with converting it to a true install, which many things I read said would be difficult, I decided to just back up my small amount of data, erase it, and redo it the right way. Now I have something a little more in keeping with what I would expect from a dual boot, and every time I start up, I see a purple GRUB screen. Success I think.\n\n(I successfully created the partition without problem or data loss, but wasn't paying attention and installed 32 bit Ubuntu on a 64 bit system. Didn't work well. Fixed the MBR, uninstalled Linux, and installed the RIGHT Ubuntu).\n\n\n*\n\n*So can I rename these partitions?\n\n*I set up a 50GB partition. How come the partition is 54 GB, and Ubuntu only took 4?\n\n\nA: It seems you installed Ubuntu with the Windows Installer (Wubi). This means that your Ubuntu installation resides in a file on your Windows (NTFS) partition (look for C:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk). This file will be mounted as a loop device on booting into Ubuntu. This is the \"peripheral device\" you noticed.\nIt is therefore likely not the dual-boot setup you intended to do. But, as you already mentioned, if everything works fine you may leave it like that.

It was working perfectly, no problems, no data lost or corruption. \nThen I went away for 2 days and in my absence I don't know what happened in that period, now both Windows 7 and Ubuntu keep hanging continuously, like when you paint and change a brush it'll hang, I mean on very simple commands and I know my computer does not hang on such petty things.\nI use it for developing music and the specification are:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Model: DELL-XPS  \n\n*Processor: Intel i5, 2.53 GHz  \n\n*RAM/Memory: 4GB   \n\n*Hard disk size: 500GB HDD  \n\n*Windows 7 partition: 417 GB  \n\n*Ubuntu Partition: 50 GB   \n\n\nPlease Help.\n\nA: Ubuntu and Windows does not affect one another so if you get issues like this at the same time in both, it is very likely a hardware issue. I would test your harddisk for errors. You can do that in Palimpsest in Ubuntu. In the right-most column at the top, you'll see a button to run SMART-tests. \nAnother common cause of symptoms like that, is overheating which can be caused by a dusty fan for instance. \n\nA: I've known about this problem for the past 10 years. Its the reason I have my own business:\nThe thermal grease of your CPU can only last for 2 years. After that time you need to take your laptop/PC to a technical service so they can clean it and change thermal grease.\nIf it is a laptop it should be cleaned every 18 months and thermal grease should be changed every 2 cleaning cycles. People always think a computer can last several years. This is true, but only if you keep it clean and change thermal grease. If you fail to do that it will suddenly overheat and have a massive performance drop such as the one you're experiencing, and potentially damage hardware. \nAlways take care of your computer. I've had my laptop for 7 years, and its still working fine.\n\nA: Assuming that the system is not overheating, then check your memory and your hard drive(s). To check your memory, let memtest run overnight. You can start it from the Grub menu. Just photograph the screen in the morning and post it here. To check your hard drive, try sudo smartctl -t long /dev/hda, then don't touch the computer for a few hours until it finishes. You might need to install smartmontools first. See here.\n\nA: On Windows, if it isn't a hardware problem, try CCleaner, sometimes that helps. If it IS a hardware problem, check the ensure the memory is fully registering, sometimes, when exposed to a high temperature things happen to happy hardware. Also, I know I had this happen to me, could it be possible you didn't notice the hang before? I came back to a PC to find it a LOT slower than I had remembered and that was simply because I was used to the hang to the extend that I had forgotten to care.\n\nA: Well, let me suggest another possible reason for this strange behaviour: A weak cmos-battery. You should check first if there are any settings changed or corrupted in your BIOS. If your Notbook went out of power during your vacation AND the Bios-battery is low, settings for CPU, Bus-speed and ram-clocking, may have reset to standard values not corresponding with your actual system. This can cause slow computing as well.\n", "Q: Teeview-Binding to CouchDB not working with quickly (PyGtk + Glade) For the Ubuntu App Developer Showdown I need to know some basics about quickly.

Its an open source program which you can easily download. If you face any difficulties then you can use Jperf which has a graphical frontend to the iperf.\nYou can do various tweaks also based on the readings you get from these two as it allows to measure bandwidth and make changes to the network parameters.\n\nA: I would use cacti to achieve this. It is a complete RRDTool based monitoring and graphing system.\nThere are cacti templates available online that will help you achieve your goal quite easily.\n\nA: Sorry to tell but you will have to program such an application according to your needs. You can probably do it with PhpMyAdmin and then wrap it up to show graph and all the fancies that you want. Or if you want then you can use some of the wordpress' code because it contains those fancy stuff.\n", "Q: Why does Wubi slow down or freeze when there is heavy disk activity? Im a first-time user to Ubuntu-12.04 with WUBI installation.\nI have a Dell vostro 3450 with i5 2410m, 3 gb ram, intel hd3000, amd 6630m hybrid.\nSurfing and playing games works flawlessly.  However, I'm having huge problems when installing applications and generally copying and moving files.\nWhen doing so, system is significantly slower and freezes quite often (Firefox gets bluish, sometimes even black n white). I would say that Ubuntu allocates too much resources on file transfers and installing, but even these tasks are very slow.\nHere is very specific example : Today I tried to move a 6 GB file from my Windows 7 installation.\nIt was good at first, so I jumped to Firefox but after a while firefox started to randomly turn bluish and mouse was randomly stopping working. It was gradually worse and worse until it got to a point when firefox black and whited and mouse wasn't working at all. I raged and went for some meal, when I got back screen was black. It probably unlogged me due to inactivity, when I pushed random button to bring screen to life I had to wait few minutes to let it show me only my screen background. No log in screen, just background and working mouse. NoteBook fan was working at 100 % so I assumed that file transfer was going on and I left it to work. Nothing then changed for a full hour so I hard rebooted it. File transfer unsuccessful, It transfered hardly 2 gigs. Is this normal ? \nWhat to do in these situations ? It didn't let me load system manager and not even the terminal.\n\nA: I noticed the same freezes. While I can't tell why this happens, I know a way to get rid of that. Here's how:\nIn a terminal, type\necho \"deadline\" | sudo tee /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler\nTry moving or copying larger ammounts of files again. You should notice a huge difference. If so, make the change permanent by typing in a terminal:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nIn the line beginning with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\", add the following string in between the \"\"s:\nelevator=deadline\n\nSave and exit. After that, type in a terminal\nsudo update-grub\n\nReboot.\nFYI: This changes the so-called scheduler to 'deadline'.\nSource: http://techtitbits.com/2010/04/get-rid-of-freeze-ups-during-disk-io-activity-in-ubuntu/\n================================================================================\nAnother Possibility would be to lower dirty_ratio settings.\nTo test it, type in a terminal:\nsudo bash -c \"echo 10 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio\"\nsudo bash -c \"echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio\"\nIf this helps, make it permanent by editing your sysctl.conf:\ngksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\nAt the end of the file, add the following lines:\nvm.dirty_ratio=10\nvm.dirty_background_ratio=5\nSave, close and reboot. Done.\n\nA: You have to remember that Wubi installs Ubuntu in your existing Windows Partition and not in a separate one.\nIt looks like Ubuntu has no space to work in your existing Windows Partition. It could be trying to use swap but not getting enough which causes the slowing down of the system and the heavy disk activity.\nI would either install Ubuntu at a separate partition without Wubi, or expanding your Windows Partition size and the size of your Wubi install.\nYou can also take a look at this article on how to improve the performance of your hard drive.\n\nA: From my experience, Disk I/O is the bane of any sane user experience under Linux.\nThings that make it worse:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a laptop(2.5\") disk, especially a 5k rpm disk\n\n*Using wubi or LVM/Encryption.\n\n*\n\n*This is because normally, reads/writes to disk are quite optimized to your hardware,\nbut having that enabled creates a layer of indirection that mess this up.\n\n\n\nReasons for the slowdown:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most things on your linux-system need to touch disk quite often, they write logs, cache-files and sometimes they synchronize things through the file-system. \n\n*When the disk is busy, everything grinds to a halt, waiting for their check on the cache-file etc will complete. This is especially noticeable with gui-applications.\n\n\nSo, in general. Anything you can do to avoid touching disk is good.\nYou can change your firefox cache-directory to /run/shm\nThis is a ram-disk. It is very fast, but anything you store there will \n\n\n*\n\n*eat your ram\n\n*be gone after a reboot.\n\n\nTutorials for this can be done by using google.\n\nA: I've run into this, too.  I was hoping a ReadyBoost solution would fix the issue, but it didn't make a huge difference for me.  Still, it may work for you.  \nMy thoughts: processes that use a lot of disk access (which is already 10,000 times slower than memory access) now must do more of it to deal with the Wubi harddrive format.\nMy suggestion:\n1. Switch from Firefox to Chrome.  And close unnecessary tabs. 60% faster.\n2. Switch to a lightweight, minimalistic web server, if that is what your application is.  I tried 3 - Reddit server runs slowly on my 6 year old laptop, both the server and the client, and I hit some nasty install issues with Telescope, but so far I am loving Arc 3.1 - the source behind Hacker News.  It's a little hard to find, so here's the URL: http://ycombinator.com/arc/arc3.1.tar\nSide thought: if one were to use copying and symbolic links to make all your disk accesses reside on your flash drive, for whichever directories are hit with the most disk accesses, that should make a difference by bypassing the Wubi filesystem completely and replacing it with SSD.\n", "Q: Is Unity causing my Macbook to run near-burning hot?

Any tips?\nEDIT:\nI've done this for now:\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-classic-gnome-desktop-in-ubuntu-12-04-precise.html\n\nA: Running metacity --replace from a virtual console doesn't work because it doesn't know which X11 display to attach to. The default behavior is to attach to the display it runs in...and a shell running in a virtual console isn't on any X11 display.\nInstead, you must manually specify the display. It will be :0 unless you've configured your X11 display differently. (Even if you have multiple monitors, it will still be :0 unless you've changed your X11 configuration.)\nTo do that, use this command:\nmetacity --display=:0 --replace\n\nIf that does't work, then try manually killing the compiz process first. To do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run killall compiz. Wait a few seconds. Perhaps compiz will respond to this signal and terminate.\n\n*Run killall -KILL compiz.

Maybe not the best place for a big project, but another option.\n\nA: Use Launchpad's +junk branch feature to publish your code to a temporary location. In fact, it is not temporary, as it will remain there until you explicitly delete it, but it is a nice place to put unfinished code you're experimenting with on a public location.\nThis way it will stay out of the way from your regular branches, but you'll still be able to access it and show it to everyone online.\nThe only requirement is that you've got a Launchpad account and have uploaded SSH keys and finished the procedure to use Launchpad for code hosting.\nAfter that, you simply need to run this command on your terminal, from the location where your code lives:\nbzr push lp:~<your-launchpad-id>/+junk/<name-of-your-temp-branch>\n\nThat's it! You'll then be able to point other people to https://code.launchpad.net/~<your-launchpad-id>/+junk/<name-of-your-temp-branch>\n\nA: Use a GitHub gist - You don't even need to register.\n\nA: If what you want to be reviewed is a single file, you can use any one of the number of popular Pastebin services.\nI would personally recommend Ubuntu's Pastebin Service.\n", "Q: Why does apt-get give me an \"Unable to connect\" error?

One is how to get Ubuntu to correctly recognize your touchpad, and the other is how to add the keybinding.\nI don't know how to add the Fn+F3 keybinding to disable the touchpad. Is Fn+F3 a standard multimedia keystroke on your computer designed to disable the touchpad? If so, then you likely will not have to add any extra keybindings to get it to work once Ubuntu recognizes your touchpad correctly. Basically, Ubuntu likely correctly recognizes that you want to disable the touchpad, but, since it thinks that your touchpad is a mouse, sees no touchpads to disable.\nOne possible solution - upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04. The N5110's are fairly new computers, and as such, some of the hardware isn't necessarily supported by older kernel versions. I'm personally running Ubuntu 14.04 on a Dell Inspiron i3531, and that was initially very frustrating - only kernel version 3.13.0-32 and higher correctly supports the touchpad, and 14.04 came with version 3.13.0-25.\nFor what it is worth, Ubuntu 14.04 just had its first point release, so it's stable right out of the box with very few bugs. It's also not radically different than 12.04. And if your reason for not upgrading has to do with the commercialization, then install the unity tweak tool - you can get rid of all of the Unity web integration.\n", "Q: Why does the installer freeze at the moving dots?

Still can't get past the dots.\nI've done this on other computers without a problem - any advice?\n\nA: Your issue doesn't have anything to do with Windows XP.  Either the Ubuntu live CD doesn't get along with your hardware, or you have a corrupt CD.\nTry using the Alternate install disk.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads\n\nA: I've seen this happen, and it isn't even due to driver issues.

Try it again then.\n\nA: You can bear in mind that the earlier LTS release (10.04) is still supported. It may work for you better than 12.04.

If you're not sure, issue the mount command without arguments when the drive is mounted (even if you mounted it manually), it will tell you the filesystem type. (in 12.04 you may simply type auto which determines the filesystem for you at launch)\n\n*The other values (defaults 0 0) are OK like I show them.\n\n\nIf you want to learn more, you can read man fstab.\n\nA: If you are using FAT32 or NTFS file system using the following:\nFor NTFS:\n/dev/sda3   /media/entertainment    ntfs-3g rw,auto,user,fmask=0111,dmask=0000,noatime,nodiratime   0   0\n/dev/sda4   /media/other    ntfs-3g rw,auto,user,fmask=0111,dmask=0000,noatime,nodiratime   0   0\n\nnoatime and nodiratime are some optimizations. If you want you can remove them.\nFor FAT32 replace ntfs-3g with vfat.\n\nA: You could do it via /etc/fstab.\nFor example, if you add\n/dev/hda2   /myfiles    ext2    defaults    0    0\n\nIt means that the device/partition located at /dev/hda2 will be mounted to /myfiles using the file system ext2, with default mount options and no dumping and no error-checking enabled.\n\nA: fstab will help you for sure.\nFor those lazy and cautious ones who want to use a simple and self-explanatory GUI there is a tool called Storage Device Manager (pysdm). The tutorial here will do basically the same as other answers in this thread suggest to do, but the tool will accomplish it with a couple of clicks and no need to enter configurations manually into fstab config file.\nsudo apt-get install pysdm(Ubuntu) or sudo yum install pysdm(Fedora)\nNothing should go wrong, but just in case, backup the fstab conf: sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.old\nNow run the Storage Device Manager and select your preferred partition, click \"Assistant\":\n\nPySDM assistant settings for automounting EXT4 partition:\n\nPySDM assistant for automounting NTFS partition:\n\nReboot and see that your drive gets automatically mounted now.\nYou can learn more about assistant settings from this article, as it explains the process in details and my answer is based on it.\nUPDATE: pysdm has been removed from the Ubuntu archives (AskUbuntu page), sudo apt-get install pysdm does not work anymore.\n\nAvoid using pysdm for now.\nIt's been removed from the Ubuntu archives for a reason:\nplease remove Pysdm from Ubuntu repositories. It is obsolete (not updated since June 2006 !!), buggy (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pysdm) , doesn't handle UUIDs (which is now fstab standard in all supported Ubuntu versions !!!) and it has already been removed from Debian repositories.\n\n\nA: If you do not want to partition or cannot afford to, you can use udisks to mount or unmount devices or disks. The UUID method is the most stable one as other ID methods can change if you rename your label for example.\nudisks --mount /dev/sdb\nudisks --mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/70439c63-de2c-4319-a832-0dee5ea05fc5\nudisks --mount /dev/disk/by-label/HDD\n\nIt will in fact do the same as you would do by clicking the device on nautilus.\n\nJust add it as a \"startup application\" to preform at login.\nTo unmount, (if you need to):\nudisks --unmount /dev/sdb\n\nWill do the same as clicking the unmount arrow in nautilus.\nOne disadvantage over the fstab method is the device will be mounted in /media/disk_label with no option to choose another mount-point.\nOne advantage is you do not need root access to mount or unmount the drive.\nMore info over different methods of auto-mounting : AutomaticallyMountPartitions\n\nA: To set the drive to mount automatically each time you boot the computer\nYou’ll need to edit /etc/fstab: Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

First you should set editable to true:\ntextview.set_editable(true)\n\nYou will need to get its textbuffer which is the textviews data:\nbuffer = textview.get_buffer()\n\nThen using that buffer you can get and set the data in it. to get the text currently in the buffer use:\nbuffer.get_text(buffer.get_start_iter(), buffer.get_end_iter(), false)\n\nThe first and second arguments are the range to get the text, in this case all off it. The last argument specifies whether you would like to get hidden characters, in this case false. To insert text you can use the following:\nbuffer.insert(buffer.get_end_iter(), \"Sample text\")\n\nThe first argument specifies where to insert the text, in this case at the end. the second argument is the text to insert. To replace all the data in the buffer you can use:\nbuffer.set_text(\"Sample text\")\n\nThis will replace everything in the buffer with \"Sample text\". To insert an image you need to create a pixbuf to do this use the following:\npixbuf = gtk.gdk.pixbuf_new_from_file(filename)\n\nTo resize the pixbuf use:\npixbuf.scale_simple(dest_width, dest_height, gtk.gdk.INTERP_BILINEAR)\n\nThe first two arguments are the new width and height, the third argument is the interpolation type which controls how it scales (there are four types which can be found here). You can then add this pixbuf to the buffer using:\nbuffer.insert_pixbuf(buffer.get_end_iter(), pixbuf)\n\nThis will insert an image at the end of the buffer. \nYou can also do things like add widgets, set margins, copy and paste from clipboard, insert at the cursor, etc. but you can look at the links below for that.\nEdit: For a formatted save/load you can use the textbuffers serialization method. First you should use its register_serialize_tagset() method:\nformat = buffer.register_serialize_tagset()\n\nNext you can use its serialize method to get the serialized data:\ndata buffer.serialize(buffer, format, buffer.get_start_iter(), buffer.get_end_iter())\n\nThis will return the data in textbuffer's internal format, which you can save to a file. To load this data first call textbuffer's register_deserialize_tagset() method:\nformat = emptyBuffer.register_deserialize_tagset()\n\nThen you can load the data using its deserialize() method:\nemptyBuffer.deserialize(emptyBuffer, format, emptyBuffer.get_end_iter(), data)\n\nThis will load the data into the textbuffer.\nEdit2: if you want the user to be able to drag to move and resize you will have to instead load the pixbuf into an image widget, the image widget into a event box, the event box into a child anchor to put into the the textview you can handle x events for that widget and write code in the handlers to that will move or resize the image.\nResources:\n\n\n*\n\n*gtk.TextView\n\n*gtk.TextBuffer\n\n*gtk.gdk.Pixbuf\n", "Q: Need to install ethernet firmware for Dell PowerEdge 2650 integrated BCM5703 NIC I have a Dell Poweredge 2650 and I'm trying to install the ethernet firmware/driver. I found this page but I can't figure out how to install it. Their isn't a loader.conf and I would like to avoid modding the kernel. I am using 12.04 server.\n\nA: I think the bge driver and loader.conf is actually for FreeBSD. With Linux and the Broadcom 5703 chipset I think you'll need the tg3 driver, or possibly bnx2 but most likely tg3. Try doing:\nsudo modprobe tg3\nifconfig -a\n\nmodprobe should give no output and ifconfig should show the NIC. You should be able to use the NIC just fine once the driver is correctly loaded. If you do want to update the firmware anyway, you'll need to have the driver loaded first. You may be able to do any firmware updates following the Ubuntu instructions, but if there is difficulty you may need to boot to the Dell OpenManage Live CD and do the updates from that environment.\nLet us know how it goes!\n", "Q: Unable to click in Windows install of 12.04 I just installed ubuntu 12.04 through windows in order to try it out.

You can check for an updated version of Winetricks at winetricks.org, and/or look up the location in the script and see if the file still exists at the listed location.

The system boots and it all works fine, but I can't really save any changes or even access the USB drive, can't create folders or copy files to it, and can't connect to the Internet. When I try to access the Internet, and enter the password of the access point, it tries to connect and than says \"network disconnected\" and asks for the password again. I know the password I am inputting is correct. (It also fails to save the password.)

I still couldn't get past the second screen for the same reason. I tried to use all the disk management utilities and format the second drive but nothing i did had any effect.  \n\nA: I believe you are looking for a page like this:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent/\nThis lists several methods to create a persistent USB drive that saves your customizations, like your desktop wallpaper and Wi-Fi configurations.  I would burn an Ubuntu Live CD and select your USB drive as the target disk to accomplish something like this.  Also, don't forget to make the drive bootable and install a bootloader.

There's options for everything there except for the bold title in the menu bar.  It's still set to (what I assume is) Ubuntu bold, and I'd like to change it so that it's consistent with all my other fonts.\n\nA: The Menu Bar font in the Appmenu (when in Unity)  is as far as I'm aware not customizable by itself as in there's no appmenu font setting, It takes on the system fonts specifically the Title bar font, when not using the appmenu it takes on the \"Default font\" in the Gnome Tweak Tool settings.\n\nA: You can try  MyUnity  it's great to customize your Ubuntu 12.04 \n", "Q: SSHFS mount does not work on startup using fstab While I am able to mount a folder from a remote server using mount folder the entry in fstab is giving Connection reset by peer:\nI have the following in my fstab\nsshfs#username@remote:/folder/ folder fuse defaults,idmap=user 0 0\n\nI have also configure trusted relationship between the remote server and the origin using public keys. and I am able to do ssh remote and authenticate without using a password.\nAlso, If I log in on the origin machine and use:\nmount folder\n\nthe folder mounts succesfully.\nAny suggestions?\nOrigin distro : 12.04 Remote server: 11.10\n\nA: sshfs needs a network connection. Maybe it is not set up at the time the ftsab mounts are executed. Never had problems with cable network but if I use wifi I have to mount it manually too. You also should add the _netdev parameter to your fstab.

I'm still learning about Linux. \nAs a Linux distro, Ubuntu is blessed with the ability to multi-task, the concurrent execution of programs. And these programs have processes, taking up their chunk of the system resources as necessary.  \nProcess scheduling allows the execution of processes by priorities, so that the higher valued priorities execute more often that the lower valued priorities.  But it is a surprise to me that the very important processes actually exhibit lower valued priorities. Why is this the case?  What are the benefits?\n\nA: In linux, processes with lower priorities are executed with a more favourable schedule. It can range from -20 (processes are given the best treatment) to 20 (they are less favoured by the kernel). You can check nice man page for more info.\nSo important process have low priority so that they will be favoured over normal processes.\n", "Q: Which framework/toolkit for modern unity applications? I want to code some applications for ubuntu (no other platforms), but which gui-toolkit would be the \"official\" one... in the past (gnome) gtk+ was my choice, but afaik unity uses Nux. I don't want to use these standard buttons and \"old style ui\". Qt would be great for KDE but what's the latest \"unity\" toolkit suggestion?\nps: programming language would be C/C++ or python.\n\nA: You don't need to use any specific toolkit to interface with Unity, all of it's APIs are available via GObject Introspection.  This means you can use them with multiple languages and multiple toolkits.  You are free to use Gtk or Qt, C/C++ or Python, or any other combination of language and toolkit you prefer.\nYou can see the Unity APIs here: http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/platform/api/12-04/\n\nA: Gtk+\nGtk is the default tool kit of gnome ,so it is better to use gtk ,even then qt is well supported in ubuntu . So you can use it also ,nux is used in unity launcher and dash only . It is not suitable for creating desktop apps\n\nA: I don't know what you mean when you say unity and ubuntu-specific applications. You want to make a notification plugin of some sort?\nBoth Qt and GTK+ frameworks are preinstalled (I think) in ubuntu 12.04, so programs in either framework wouldn't have any problems.\nYou could try: Qt creator or Anjuta IDE (both available in ubuntu software center).\nSee which one fulfills your needs. :)\n", "Q: Permission denied error for running command on ubuntu cd ~/mosesdecoder/sample-models\n~/mosesdecoder/bin/moses -f phrase-model/moses.ini < phrase-model/in > out\n\nI’m having an issue running this on the command line it gives me a permission denied error, is there anyway around it?

When I choose the option replace windows 7 with Ubuntu, I need to select a drive. Since I have only one drive in my desktop, I must use it. But on my windows the drive is partitioned into a C  and D drive (both 500GB). I put all my files on the D drive, so I can still use them in Ubuntu. My intention is to install Ubuntu on the c drive from windows, but when i click on advanced partitioning tool, I see that there are four partitions:\nsda1(ntfs): 14.7 GB,\nsda2(ntfs): 104.9 MB,\nsda3(ntfs): 492.7 GB,\nsda4(ntfs): 492.7 GB\n\nMy problem is that I don't really know what the first two partitions are, and which one is the c:/ drive from windows. I guess it is the third, but I must be sure because otherwise all my data is lost. What exactly do I have to do to just install Ubuntu on one partition and keep another partition with my files (the d in windows)? Also I don't really know on what type of filesystem Ubuntu has to be installed on(fat, ntfs, ext,..). The desktop that I'm working on is a Acer Aspire AX3900. Thanks (and sorry for my bad English).\n\nA: As far as the partitions go sda3 is most likely the drive that you want but there is no way to know for sure with the information you provided. You could run df -h -T to see the written data on each drive and the GB amount should tell you which drive is which.\nAs far as installing Ubuntu goes I would recommend using Ext4.\n\nA: Do you use a mobile PC?\nThese partitions could be a rescue partiton, maybe sda1. And the sda2 partiton might be the boot partition of Windows 7. I would check if this partitons are a rescue and boot partiton by checking its data or asking your PC manufacturer or seller.\nIf these partitions are the boot and rescue partiton you could delete sda1, sda2 and sda3 with using GParted and create a new partiton. But if you want to use swap-space don't forget to reserve some space and use it as swap.\nNow you can install your Ubuntu with using the new partiton I think it would be sda1 and using the swap space, sda2. I would also hang in the sda4 partiton in your system but you have not to do so.\nI hope I could help you a little bit, if not please reply to this answer\n", "Q: Can't upgrade ubuntu server from 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS I'm trying to upgrade my 10.04 server using do-release-upgrade, but it keeps saying there is no new version available.\nIf I change the prompt config in /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades to normal, I am able to upgrade to 10.10 though, but I don't want to perform 4 separate upgrades in order to reach the new lts.\n\nA: To upgrade Ubuntu 10.04 server to 12.04 \nFirst make sure that you have the latest updates\nsudo apt-get update & sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nInstall update-manager-core\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\n\nEdit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set Prompt=lts\nLaunch the upgrade tool, and follow the on-screen instructions:\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\nSource: http://library.linode.com\n\nA: Install update-manager-core .\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\n\nedit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set Prompt=lts\nthen do as do-release-upgrade. \n\nA: Install update manager core\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\n\nand launch upgrade manager using \nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nFollow the on screen instructions \n", "Q: Why don't the Fn-hotkeys on my Asus N56 laptop work?

That might point to a solution you can find on your own or you could post them here.\n\nA: Well, assuming you're using 12.04 LTS, the hot key setting is more included with the default operating system. I has an ASUS eeePC 900 and when I went from Windows XP to Windows 7, I lost functionality of my function keys as you have.

Ok so I have decided to delve into the realms of casual coding and I have been told Python is a great language for beginners like myself. I know (not really sure though) the  Python interpreter is included by default in Ubuntu but plan to install the IDLE GUI as my Python GUI. What else do I need to do to make my 12.04 set-up a true Python development environment? \n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 Python 2.7.3 is already pre-installed\nTake a look at the Ubuntu Software Center -> Developer Tools -> Python There you can find IDLE or SPE, which are both good development environments. They should work out of the box.\nThere are also Plugins available for Eclipse and Netbeans. \nif you want to use the newest version of Python take a look at this website \nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/\n\nA: There is a good video here on YouTube about how to write a python program for Ubuntu using Quickly.  The example shows how to create a quick browser.\nIt uses whatever editor you have configured, such as gedit or vim.\n\nA: There are a lot of different development evironments. You can simply use the text editor of your choice. Most of them, like the integrated gedit have syntax highlighting. You can then simply run your program with python. There is no need for compiling.\nYou could also use an integrated developer environment (IDE). Those give you a little more support in coding. Take a look at this list. I prefer eclipse with the PyDev plugin.\nFor starters create a file myProgram.py and open it wiht gedit. Write your program in that file, just google for some tutorials. After the first few lines of code gedit will recognize you're writing python and starts to highlight the syntax. If you're done open a terminal, change to the folder where your program is saved and start it with python myProgram.py. Python is a interpreted language so the code can be executed directly. In some other languages you have to compile your source code first. It then creates an binary file you can execute. But you don't have to bother with that if you use python.\nHope that helps a little, if you want more detailed information just ask :-)\n\nA: I tried IDLE but after a bit I found that a better development environment was using Eclipse with the pydev plugin.  Eclipse can be gotten using the software center or from apt-get install.  The plugin is easy to add by starting Eclipse and going\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/\nhttp://pydev.org/\n\nA: sudo apt-get install python should do it. (although this is usually already installed)\nThen you can just create your python code in some folder as .py files, and then do python /path/to/the/python/script.py.\n\nA: Ubuntu has Python installed by default. Python IDLE is good for checking some snippets of code but it is not very good for doing some serious work. I recommend installing ipython for doing some command line exploration. \nWell, in order to setup an IDE you could choose between Sublime Text 2(highly recommended) and Vim. You could use my dotfiles for both the editors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sublime Text2\n\n*Vim\nBoth of these dotfiles have all the plugins, linters installed and would be excellent place for you to start with. Hope this helps you.\n\nA: You can also use virtualenv, it is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.\nInstall virtualenv via pip:\n$ pip install virtualenv\nhttp://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/\n", "Q: How can I tell if I am out of inotify watches? I use an application that consumes inotify watches. I've already set\nfs.inotify.max_user_watches=32768\n\nin /etc/sysctl.conf but last night the application stopped indexing unless I ran it manually, which leads me to suspect I am out of watches. \nSince I don't know what the trade off is when I increase this number (does it consume more RAM?), I don't know if I should just increase this number, so I'd like to know if there's a way I can tell if it's using all these watches and what the tradeoffs might be for increasing it.\n\nA: How do you know if you are out of watches? tail will tell!\n\n\n*\n\n*Start tail with the -f (follow) option on any old file, e.g. tail -f /var/log/dmesg:\n\n\n*\n\n*If all is well, it will show the last 10 lines and pause; abort with Ctrl-C\n\n*If you are out of watches, it will fail with this somewhat cryptic error:  \n\ntail: cannot watch '/var/log/dmsg': No space left on device\nFor the curious: Why is tail a \"telltail\"?\n\n\n*\n\n*Actually, any well-written app should have the courtesy of telling you, since the inotify API/calls clearly tells them what the deal is.\n\n*Try strace tail -f ... instead, and when it succeeds, it ends with:\n\n\ninotify_add_watch(4, \"/var/log/dmesg\", IN_MODIFY...) = 1\n\n\n*but if it fails, i.e. you are out of watches, it'll say:\n\n\ninotify_add_watch(4, \"/var/log/dmesg\", IN_MODIFY..)\n= -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device)\n\nCan you increase the watches? By how much? Any tradeoffs?\nShort answer: Sure, no sweat. Go to straight to a half-million (524288) if you want...the additional memory used should be negligible on a modern system with 4GB+ of memory.\n\n\n*\n\n*Each used inotify watch takes up 540 bytes (32-bit system), or 1 kB (double - on 64-bit) [sources: 1, 2]\n\n*This comes out of kernel memory, which is unswappable.\n\n*So, assuming you set the max at 524288, and all were used (improbable), you'd be using approx. 256MB/512MB of 32-bit/64-bit kernel memory\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that your application will also use additional memory to keep track of the inotify handles, file/directory paths, etc. -- how much depends on its design.\n\n\n*What's the max value? I guess none, in theory, as long as you have enough RAM. In practice, 524288 has been officially recommended by apps, and people have been setting it to 2 million, with the accompanying memory usage, of course.\n\nA: I don't know if I should just increase this number\nThe easy way of checking if you reached your max_user_watches value is, with your user, to use inotifywatch, from the package inotify-tools, and check if you can still collect information from a file.\nFor example inotifywatch -v /home/bruno/.profile for me returns:\nEstablishing watches...\nTotal of 1 watches.\nFinished establishing watches, now collecting statistics.\n\nSo inotify has no issues creating a new watch, no issues here.\nIf you have reached your maximum limit in inotify watches it will return something like\nFailed to watch /home/bruno/.profile; upper limit on inotify watches reached!\n\nIf you see something like this then you have reached the limit and will need to increase the allowed watches limit.\nDoes it consume more RAM?\nYes, it does. But according to this old article the amount it consumes is minimal compared with other aspects of a running desktop.\n\n--MEMORY USAGE--\nThe inotify data structures are light weight:\ninotify watch is 40 bytes\n  inotify device is 68 bytes\n  inotify event is 272 bytes\nSo assuming a device has 8192 watches, the structures are only going\n  to consume 320KB of memory. With a maximum number of 8 devices allowed\n  to exist at a time, this is still only 2.5 MB\nEach device can also have 256 events queued at a time, which sums to\n  68KB per device. And only .5 MB if all devices are opened and have\n  a full event queue.\nSo approximately 3 MB of memory are used in the rare case of \n  everything open and full.\nEach inotify watch pins the inode of a directory/file in memory,\n  the size of an inode is different per file system but lets assume\n  that it is 512 byes. \nSo assuming the maximum number of global watches are active, this would\n  pin down 32 MB of inodes in the inode cache.

I have Ubuntu running as a vm in VirtualBox at the moment, but in the future, if I want to dual-boot it with Windows or another OS installed on my hard-drive, what partitioning method should I use to make room for it? \n1)Manually partition my hard drive via disk management in Windows (or the equivalent in another OS), making appropriate room for the main partition upon which Ubuntu will be installed and swap space;\n2)Partition via the Ubuntu installer options;\n3)Use gparted or another free tool like it. \nI am uncertain as to why I would want to use one over the other.\nLastly, am I correct to think that it would be the acme of foolishness to try to partition drives within a virtual machine (since that partitioning would be inherently limited to the limitations set upon it by the virtualization software, e.g., VirtualBox)?\nThanks!\nP.S. Oh, and I am also planning on not modifying the MBR of Windows if I ever do dual-boot with Ubuntu, using instead a piece of free software (like easyBCD or something) to avoid the headaches of Grub being overwritten by a Windows update.\n\nA: It all depends on what your current partitioning scheme is and what you want it to look like with Ubuntu installed. If you are familiar with GParted, I would highly recommend running that from the LiveCD and setting up partitions before starting the installer.\n\nP.S. Oh, and I am also planning on not modifying the MBR of Windows if I ever do dual-boot with Ubuntu, using instead a piece of free software (like easyBCD or something) to avoid the headaches of Grub being overwritten by a Windows update.\n\nIn that case, use Windows' Disk Management to move/shrink all Windows partitions to the LEFT of the hard disk. You can then start directly with the Ubuntu Installer's partitioner -- create an extended partition in the free space, within which you can create all your Ubuntu partitions, and be sure to install Grub to the extended partition (typically something like /dev/sda5) and NOT to the MBR (/dev/sda).\n\nam I correct to think that it would be the acme of foolishness to try to partition drives within a virtual machine\n\nNo. The hard disk in a virtual machine is like any other, so feel free to partition it, dual-boot your virtual machine, triple-boot it even! The only limitation is that of performance compared to a real hard disk, imposed by a combination of Virtualbox and the underlying physical hardware.\n\nA: My experience with using a gparted or disk utility to resize a windows partition is not positive. In a couple of instances the windows partition became corrupt and had to reformat and reinstall windows.\nI usually resize the windows partition in windows using the build in disk partitioning tool to free space and then install ubuntu with a LiveUSB on the free space.\nAbout where to install Grub, I always used the default settings and never had problems with it being overwritten by Windows.\n\nA: If you're not comfortable repartitioning your disk there is the additional alternative of Wubi, basically Ubuntu inside windows: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\n", "Q: How do I prepare for installing Ubuntu from Windows (Wubi)?

To fix this install the following driver through terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current=295.33-0ubuntu1~precise~xup1\n\nOnce you have installed it don't go straight to your Update Manager otherwise it will want to install the 295.40 driver which you don't want. Go instead to the Synaptic Package Manage and lock the 295.33 driver. This will stop the Update Manager from wanting to update it. You can now use the Update Manager as usual.\nThere is another driver 295.49 which has not been released yet by Ubuntu. Keep an eye out for it and update to it when it is released into the mainstream updates.\n\nA: Go to Synaptic Package Manager and see what driver is actually installed. Make sure you have actually locked the 295.33 version and not something else that just has 295.33 mentioned in its description. If you have not actually locked the driver the 295.40 driver will install when you open Update manager and the problem will start again. \nYou could also try the following and see if this helps. Open a terminal and try this installing the 295.49 driver:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current=295.49-0ubuntu1~precise~xup1\n\nOnce installed lock it as described in my previous post.\nAlso a fresh install could help.

I get a strong wireless signal throughout my house, and the wireless symbol in the upper-right-hand corner shows that it's connected. The problem is, occasionally I am unable to access the internet (still having a strong symbol). This happened with Windows 7, too, but running the network troubleshooter fixed it each time. It claimed to be \"resetting the network adapter\".\nSo, what I need to know is: How do I replicate that process on Ubuntu?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: It seems likely that the problem is actually with your wireless access point or router, and that the fix you've described on Windows is just a workaround for the problem.\nIf that is the case, then you can reproduce the important part of the fix (disconnecting from, and reconnecting to, the wireless network) in Ubuntu by clicking on the networking icon in the notification area, disconnecting, and reconnecting.\n", "Q: How does dhclient get called under 12.04 In my 12.04 Precise install, when I boot the system, or when I plug in an ethernet cable, dhclient isn't run automatically on my wired eth0 connection. I have no running dhclient daemon. When I run dhclient manually it succeeds at pulling an address and configuring eth0 and the route table. It does output the following however :\njdoe@example:~$ sudo dhclient eth0\nRather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service(8)\nutility, e.g. service smbd reload\n\nSince the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an\nUpstart job, you may also use the reload(8) utility, e.g. reload smbd\n\nwhich indicates that it's an upstart managed thing. There are no upstart scripts in /etc/init/ for dhclient.\nI'm running isc-dhcp-client version 4.1.ESV-R4-0ubuntu5.1, the current stable release.\n\n\n*\n\n*Should dhclient be running all the time as a daemon on a standard 12.04 desktop install?\n\n*Is dhclient supposed to be launched during machine boot via upstart as the curious message I get when running dhclient suggests?\n\n*Should I have one of these ifplugd or netplug packages to launch dhclient when a cable is plugged into eth0?\n\n*Is dhclient instantiated by NetworkManager perhaps and not running at all times?\n\n*For a standard Ubuntu 12.04 install should NetworkManager have anything listed in the \"Wired\" tab of the Network Connections dialog? [example screenshot] I've both created a Wired connection profile and left it blank, neither affects dhclient being run\n\n\nOther symptoms that I'm experiencing for context are :\n\n\n*\n\n*NetworkManager doesn't gracefully manage when the wired and wireless connections are both connected, it merely uses the wireless\n\n*NetworkManager doesn't connect the VPN I have configured and sometimes try to use, over the wired network, it will only connect it over the wireless network.\n\n\n@roadmr had asked for the content of /etc/network/interfaces :\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).\n\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\n#NetworkManager#iface eth0 inet dhcp\n# This is an autoconfigured IPv6 interface\niface eth0 inet6 auto\n\n\nA: This ended up being caused by network-manager. My /etc/NetworkManager.conf file looked like this :\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\ndns=dnsmasq\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\nThis config file was set like this when the machine was built (this may be a bug). By the fact that \"managed\" was set to false, NetworkManager wasn't initiating dhclient for the interface, and it wasn't considering the wired connection to be a real connection and so it wouldn't initiate the VPN either.\nI changed \"managed\" to \"true\" and restarted the system. It works just as I'd hope now, runs dhclient, VPN works etc.\nAnd to answer some of my own questions :\n\n\n*\n\n*This is what the wired connection tab in a standard NetworkManager Network Connections dialog should look like : http://i.imgur.com/TgUs8.png\n\n*dhclient is kicked off my NetworkManager and then stays running while the connection is up\n\n\nA: When you power up the system, the first thing that should notice the Ethernet interface is the kernel. Based on the PCI ID, the kernel will try to load an appropriate driver for the card.\nIn your /var/log/syslog file you should see something like this:\nJun 21 09:54:59 snowflake kernel: [ 2600.056067] sky2 0000:03:00.0: eth0: Link is up at 1000 Mbps, full duplex, flow control rx\nJun 21 09:54:59 snowflake kernel: [ 2600.056731] ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): eth0: link becomes ready\nJun 21 09:54:59 snowflake NetworkManager[1059]: <info> (eth0): carrier now ON (device state 20)\nJun 21 09:54:59 snowflake NetworkManager[1059]: <info> (eth0): device state change: unavailable -> disconnected (reason 'carrier-changed') [20 30 40]\nJun 21 09:54:59 snowflake NetworkManager[1059]: <info> Auto-activating connection 'Wired connection 1'.\n\nThis tells you that the kernel notifies NetworkManager about the device. What I think happens (just speculating here) is that the kernel notifies udev, udev in turn tells NetworkManager (who may be registered to receive udev events) and then NetworkManager handles the rest of the configuration.\nNow, NetworkManager will refuse to manage any interface that's declared in /etc/network/interfaces. This is because it assumes that, if you configured it manually in that file, you want to manage it yourself.\nSo one way to get NetworkManager to manage your interface is to remove the entries in /etc/network/interfaces. That's why I asked you to add that data, so we can see if this is what's happening and maybe advise further. Of course, with the proper configuration even in /etc/network/interfaces, the interface should work well even without NetworkManager and without you having to do it manually every time. Still, the place to look at what may be happening is that file :)\n\nA: On the top right hand corner click on the network connection icon\nchoose edit connections > wireless (tab) > highlight your connection >click edit button > IPv4 settings (tab) check what is displayed as method: if it reads \"shared to other computers\" use the down arrow of the box to select \"Automatic DHCP\" then reboot the wireless will work without having to manually run dhclient \n", "Q: Chrome crashes Ubuntu 12.04.

I am trying to set up Eclipse for Linux Kernel Programming. The guide says set the project location as the root directory of the kernel. Where's the root directory of the kernel now? According to Linux file hierarchy system, it lists /lib as the root directory for shared libraries and kernel modules. I also see /lib32 and /lib64. However, I tried selecting /lib as the location and eclipse doesn't allow me to create the project. \n\nA: For develop a kernel module you need the headers of kernel , you can install a package kernel-headers-KERNEL_VERSION like kernel-headers-3.2.0-25 and the root directory is /usr/src/linux-headers-KERNEL_VERSION\n", "Q: Install gcc on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS When I try to install gcc on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server with apt-get install gcc, I get the following error:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n gcc : Depends: cpp (>= 4:4.6.1-2ubuntu5) but it is not going to be installed\n       Depends: gcc-4.6 (>= 4.6.1-1) but it is not going to be installed\n       Recommends: libc6-dev but it is not going to be installed or\n                   libc-dev\n\nWhen I delve deeper (i.e. try to apt-get install gcc-4.6), I get:\n gcc-4.6 : Depends: gcc-4.6-base (= 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) but 4.6.3-1ubuntu5 is to be installed\n           Depends: cpp-4.6 (= 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) but it is not going to be installed\n           Depends: libgomp1 (>= 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) but it is not going to be installed\n           Depends: libquadmath0 (>= 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) but it is not going to be installed\n           Recommends: libc6-dev (>= 2.13-0ubuntu6) but it is not going to be installed\n\nSo when I try to install gcc-4.6=4.6.1-9ubuntu3 I get a list of 366 packages to remove (including e.g. apt).

I can select all file by going to the 1st line Alt+\\, start marking the text by Alt+A, go to the last line by Alt+/\nBut there, I don't know which key to remove the selected text. Hit delete doesn't work for me but Ctrl+K to cut the text will destroy my clipboard.\nSo, what is the hotkey to delete selected text?\n\nA: To delete multiple block without overriding your clipboard, first mark the text with Alt+A (You will appear Mark Set then select the text using arrow keys) and then use Ctrl+Shift+K to delete selected text,deleted text won't appear in clipboard.\n\nA: Sadly, nano doesn't seem to have any way of bulk-deleting without clobbering the clipboard.\nThe safest thing to do while staying within the document is probably to paste your clipboard before deleting, then re-cut it again afterwards.\nIf you have a block of text already selected, then Ctrl+U will paste the clipboard text, including it in your selected block.  You can then unmark the pasted text and just cut your originally selected block.\nThese steps don't preserve your clipboard, exactly, but at least effectively perform a swap between your selection and the clipboard, allowing you to re-cut the lines you had in there before.\n\nA: nano does not support deleting a block of text, only cutting it (to the server's clipboard).\nInstead, if you are using Putty, do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Select the text you wish to copy to the clipboard with the mouse first -- this copies it to your local clipboard (i.e. Windows 7 clipboard), which nano can't touch:\n\n\n\n*Then, select your block in nano and use Ctrl-K to delete it.\n\n\n*Finally, move your cursor to the position where you want to insert the text you copied in Step 1 (you can close nano, open another file, etc. too as long as you don't select another block of text with the mouse). Right-click to paste the copied text at the cursor position.\n\nA: You could open up a separate buffer to stash your clipboard in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure \"reading into separate buffer\" is enabled (you can toggle this with Alt+F)\n\n*Use Ctrl+R and press Enter (without entering a filename), to open a blank file buffer\n\n*Paste your current clipboard in there with Ctrl+U\n\n*Use Alt+< or Alt+> to switch between open buffers\n\nA: If you are trying to empty all of the lines.\nA pretty elegant and simplest approach is from the bash-cli:\n\n\n*\n\n*echo \"\" > filename.txt\n\n*nano filename.txt\n\nA: nano of course can delete blocks, see this article\n\n\n*\n\n*use CTRL+Shift+6 to mark the beginning of your block\n\n*move cursor with arrow keys to end of your block, the text will be highlighted.\n\n*use CTRL+K to cut/delete block.\n\n\nTo paste the block to another place, move cursor to the position and the use CTRL+U. You can paste the block as often as you want to.\n\nA: CTRL SHIFT K\n\ndeletes current line, It can also be useful for quick editing. \nThanks\nEdit1:\nIn some of the putty streams, the following works too\nCTRL K\n\n\nA: Recent versions of nano (3.2+) now have this feature if you enable the zap option. Put set zap in your nanorc (or start nano with -Z/--zap), select the text your want to delete, and hit ⌫ to delete your selection without affecting the cutbuffer.\n\nA: As pointed out by @saagarjha around version 3.2 of nano they introduced a zap command which allows you to delete text without affecting the cutbuffer.\n\nM-Del           Throw away the current line (or marked region)\n\nTo delete a line by itself use Alt+Delete with the cursor on the line you want to delete.\nTo delete a block of text, first set the starting mark with Alt+a and select the text to be deleted and finally press Alt+Delete.\nTo undo a delete, press Alt+u.

Recently I wanted to test a keyboard shortcut, which is supposed to kill X server (hence very useful when you have a crash). That shortcut is not dependent on any particular window manager (like lxde, unity, kwin etc). So, it must work, even when you have unresponsive (to keybings) window manager (as opposed to Alt+Ctrl+Backspace which kills the session, and bring you a login screen).\nThat's why I interested to make my window manager(unity) unresponsive. Is past, it was very easy. Opening a terminal, typing unity --replace and then force close the terminal, was the simplest procedure. But unfortunately, This is not true in Ubuntu 12.04, (they make it very robust) Because whenever I kill the terminal, Unity automagically restart itself.\nI also tried compiz --replace but wasn't successful.\nMy question is: How can I make Unity unresponsive to any keyboard shortcuts (of it's keybindings) while I am in Unity session, so that I can test the global shortcut.\n\nA: The answer from Eliah Kagan was great, But I think, I can answer now from my experience in less technical words. \nThere are two ways (as revealed to me) to test that keyboard shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and type unity or unity --replace (both are same) and hit Enter\nIf you want a crash like look of Unity\n\n\n*\n\n*While you are on the terminal, Press Ctrl + C, the unity will be stopped immediately.\n\n*Then try your global shortcut.\n\n\nIf you want a decent look of Unity (Freeze)\n\n\n*\n\n*While you are on the terminal, Press Ctrl + Z (as suggested by @Eliah Kagan), the unity will be suspended immediately. Everything will be freezed, except the cursor.\n\n*Then try your global shortcut.\n\n\n\n\nkeyboard shortcut to kill X:\nThat particular keyboard shortcut was : Alt + PrtSc + K . You will need this, if you wanted to try.\n\nThanks to @Mahesh, for revealing that shortcut\n\nA: Running unity --replace and then closing the Terminal doesn't make unity unresponsive in any version of Ubuntu. It causes unity to not be running altogether.\nIt seems that in 12.04, unity will (usually) then restart by itself; in previous versions, it generally won't.\nIf you actually need to make unity unresponsive, you'll have to use a different technique. Perhaps you could edit your question to elaborate about your specific needs.\nA generic way to make a program stop responding is to press Ctrl+Z in its controlling terminal. So if you run unity --replace in a Terminal window (or virtual console), you can do that, and it will stop, without terminating.\nYou can also do this manually with SIGSTOP and SIGCONT (that is, kill -STOP PID and kill -CONT PID, where PID is the process ID of the process you want to make unresponsive). But having an associated terminal for the process in which you press Ctrl+Z is better because then the shell running in that terminal will let you use job control on the process. That is, it will be listed with jobs, and you can make it respond again with either bg or fg. See the official bash documentation for more information.\n", "Q: cpu fan always working and the air is hot My laptop is a Dell N5110, i3, two video cards: Intel HD3000 and Nvidia GT323M. \nRecently I installed Ubuntu 12.04. \nAfter I login in the system, the fan starts working non-stop, the fan air is hot and the noise is disturbing.\nWhat can I do to get the system working like when I am running windows 7, to get it quiet and cooler?\n\nA: This system has nvidia optimus techonology enabled.

Everything is ready on my installation of Windows 8.\n\nA: For the most part you can configure a new Printer through the Printer menu and New Printer wizard.\nBasic steps to set up a printer using those can be found in Chapter 3 of The Official Ubuntu Book.\nPlug the printer in to your laptop or to the network (however you want to connect to it), and turn it on.\nClick the Gear icon in the upper right corner and select Printers.\nIn  the Printer configuration window click Add.\nThe New Printer window will automatically start searching for any connected printers. If directly connected it should show up in the Devices list on the left. If it is a networked printer connected to a router you can expand the Network Printer and it may be listed there. If not listed then you can try the Find Network Printer listing to see if it can be detected.\nOnce you find the appropriate printer in the Device menu click Forward.\nIn the next screen, you are asked to choose the printer's make and model and a driver. The default driver should work, and you can always change it later.\nSometimes you may not find the exact make and model or driver for your printer, generally you can try the closest one. You can search for what others have experienced by looking for drivers at http://www.openprinting.org/printers.\nOnce a driver has been selected, click Forward.\nFinally, enter a description and a location of the printer. \nYou should be able to print a test page from the Printer properties for the printer you just added.

I have an external hard drive that Windows can't open (gives an error message saying the file system is unrecognized and wants me to reformat), so I am trying to see if Ubuntu, which I am running as a guest vm in VirtualBox on my Win 7 host, can open it.\nI am confused as to how to mount it. When I open up VirtualBox and click \"Settings\" for the Ubuntu vm, do I go to \"Storage\" and try to see if I can mount it there, or do I go down to \"USB\" and attempt to mount it from there? When I tried the latter, and clicked on \"Enable USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller\", a warning popped up from VB saying I needed to download VBox extensions to be able to select that option. So I downloaded the extensions and am unsure of what to do next. When I get into Ubuntu, how can I access the external hard drive via the command line? When I tried the command \"fdisk -l\", the following is printed: \nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/1053741/\nBut I have not done anything else in the VBox settings, so I don't think any of those hard drives listed are referring to the external USB drive that I want to access (even though the drive is plugged into my laptop). I do not know what drives sda1, sda2, and sda5 refer to exactly, but apparently I have an extended partition since it goes from sda1 and sda2 to sda5. When I created space for the Ubuntu virtual machine through VBox, I think I only created one main partition and one for the swap, so why is fdisk showing me 3 partitions, unless one of them is referring to the plugged in USB external hard drive, but I don't think that is it because I have not done anything else in the VBox settings for USB? \nAny suggestions will be appreciated :-).\n\nI have a Western Digital external HD of around 2TB; Windows 7 for some reason no longer allows me to open it: when I plug it into my laptop (via a USB 2.0 port), Windows either does nothing or asks me to format the drive because it doesn't recognize the file system. So I am trying to see if I can access the files in Ubuntu.\nI am running Ubuntu through VirtualBox. Before starting Ubuntu, I went into the USB settings for the Ubuntu virtual machine, and selected the external hard drive (VBox sees it). Then I started Ubuntu. Here is the print out of fdisk -l:\nDisk /dev/sda: 91.3 GB, 91268055040 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 11096 cylinders, total 178257920 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x000d5f79\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   174583807    87290880   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2       174585854   178255871     1835009    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       174585856   178255871     1835008   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 2000.4 GB, 2000396746752 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 243201 cylinders, total 3907024896 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00020fc3\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *        2048  3907024895  1953511424    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\nI believe the external drive is the bottom one, sdb1, but I have no idea how to access it. Is it already mounted or do I have to mount it manually? If Windows 7 did not recognize it, will the same problem occur in Ubuntu? \n\nA: those three partitions are all on the same drive. \nthe external hard drive should show up as /dev/sdb#. \ngo to Devices/USB Devices on the virtualbox window and select your external hard drive. now the drive should be mounted automatically by Ubuntu\n\nA: Ubuntu can usually mount drives automatically and make it available in Nautilus, the file manager. Have you looked at the available drives with Nautilus?  \nTo mount it yourself, you should create an empty directory someplace of your choosing; you can create it in your home directory to make it simple... From a commandline in the terminal, just type mkdir wd, for example.\nThen try typing sudo mount /dev/sdb1 ~/wd and see what you get in the wd directory.  This procedure should work, but is not ideal as it mounts all files with full read/write/execute privileges, but that can be refined if it works by setting it explicitly.\nAbout the extended partition\nWindows seems to like to be installed in a primary partition, but Linux doesn't care.  So a drive with both will usually have one primary partition, and one extended partition.\nAn extended partition has the advantage that it can contain any number of logical drives, whereas you are limited to only 4 primary partitions total.  I believe the extended partition counts as one primary partition, so you can have 3 primary partitions plus one extended, if you wanted, but it's best to avoid primary partitions as much as possible; extended partitions are just more flexible.\n", "Q: How to make ext3 converted to ext4 support e4defrag? I have two ext3 filesystems that are very old and have been 99% full for a long time, leading to fragmentation. Also, they've been used for running VMs with dynamic disk images and other fragmentation-causing workloads.\nI recently converted the filesystems to ext4 using the instructions here, specifically by running:\n# tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/DEV\n# e2fsck -fDC0 /dev/DEV\n\nHowever, the filesystems still don't support e4defrag:\nFailed to defrag with EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT ioctl:Operation not supported   [ NG ]\n\nI'm guessing the tune2fs command lacks some option, but googling didn't help me figure out what that might be.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I found this which had the answer:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ext4#Migrating_files_to_extents\nMigrating files to extents\nWarning: Do NOT use the following method with Mercurial repository that have been cloned locally, as doing so will corrupt the repository. It might also corrupt other hard link in the filesystem.\nEven though the filesystem is now converted to ext4, all files that have been written before the conversion do not yet take advantage of the new extents of ext4, which will improve large file performance and reduce fragmentation and filesystem check time. In order to fully take advantage of ext4, all files would have to be rewritten on disk. A utility called e4defrag is being developed and will take care of this task; however, it is not yet ready for production.\nFortunately, it is possible to use the chattr program, which will cause the kernel to rewrite the file using extents. It is possible to run this command on all files and directories of one partition (e.g. if /home is on a dedicated partition): (Must be run as root)\nfind /home -xdev -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chattr +e\nfind /home -xdev -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chattr +e\n\nIt is recommended to test this command on a small number of files first, and check if everything is going all right. It may also be useful to check the filesystem after conversion.\nUsing the lsattr command, it is possible to check that files are now using extents. The letter 'e' should appear in the attribute list of the listed files. \n--\nNote: I had assumed e4defrag could convert the files to use extents. The failed ioctl is the one that does that afaik, so I am a little confused as to why it doesn't work, but chattr +e did work for me. After you have chattr +e the files, you can then use e4defrag on them. Obviously make sure you have a backup etc just in case (I would have thought this is safe, but you never know - there is a warning here about hardlinks but I find no other reference to known issues with hardlinks).\n", "Q: Why has hibernation stopped working after moving my 12.04 install to a different laptop? I recently got a new laptop (Thinkpad X230). I didn't really have time to do a fresh install so I copied my install (xubuntu 12.04) over from my old machine (Thinkpad X61). Now when I try to hibernate it seems to do the Hibernate step fine, but doesn't seem to try and resume when booting back up. It just does a fresh boot. Is there something I need to do so the system knows where to look for the hibernation data?\n/var/log/boot.log: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1056101/\ndmesg: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1056102/\n\nA: Thanks to the pointer to /var/log/boot.log, I noticed the line\nswapon: /dev/sda5: software suspend data detected. Rewriting the swap signature.\n\nSome googling around that lead me to bug 499940, which gave me the name of the file that controls where to look for the resume data, /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume. This file still had my old swap partition UUID in it. Updating that info and running sudo update-initramfs -u solved the issue and hibernate now works.\nI was wondering if there was an official way to update this file/data and found a Debian bug (#565225) around the issue, but it has no resolution. Hand editing /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume seems to be the only solution other than perhaps something involving adding/removing the initramfs-tools package, since the file is created by the postinstall hooks. \n", "Q: How does the install process guess the timezone?

Greping timezone found the concerned lines, which issue the command:\nwget -O - -q http://geoip.ubuntu.com/lookup\n\nand parse the resulting xml.\nRather than load up python or something else, I just wrote a quick bash script that grabs the xml and yanks the timezone out with sed:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Fetch timezone from Ubuntu's geoip server\nTZ=`wget -O - -q http://geoip.ubuntu.com/lookup | sed -n -e 's/.*<TimeZone>\\(.*\\)<\\/TimeZone>.*/\\1/p'`\n\n# Set the current time\ncp /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime\n\n\nA: I believe that it uses your internet connection & ip address to find that information.

(The two PCs are running Ubuntu 12.04, and are connected with an Ethernet cable)\nI've already searched for a solution, but all I've found was the use of some softwares that should have been already installed on the \"Internet-less PC\". ( Keryx, APTonCD ... ) \nWhat I want to do is to create a mirror in my laptop which contain the packages i have in this one ( situated in /var/cache/apt/archive ) and i don't want to download all the packages from the official repository, I actually don't need them.\nCan someone tell me if it is possible to do that ?\nThanks,\n\nA: \nCan someone tell me if it is possible to do that ?\n\nYes, it is possible, and I have been doing this my entire Ubuntu life. Downloading in one computer and use the packages in another. \nAptOnCD can be downloaded in a single package, and installed in the Internetless computer, I assume you can do this. But you don't need any external software. Though I am writing both method, here.\nAptOnCD method.\nDownloading AptOnCD\n\n\n*\n\n*Download AptOnCd from here.   \nUnder the section Binary packages, click on the link matching you machine architecture. If you use 32bit Ubuntu, you need i386 package, and if your system is 64bit you can download amd64. \n \nThe new link will bring you a page, just click on the package version link.   \n\nthen click on the download link in the new page.  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the downloaded .deb file in your home directory.\n\n*Open a terminal, while you are still in home directory, run this command to install the package.\nsudo dpkg -i ./sudo dpkg -i aptoncd_0.1.98+bzr117-1.2_all.deb. (AptOnCD has no other dependency, so it can be installed standalone). Filename may vary depending on your version selection and architecture.\n\n*After completing installation, Press Super + A to bring the Dash application lens. Type in the field, aptoncd, click on the Icon to start it.\nCreating ISO file to use as a repository source.\nWhen you start AptOnCD, the software will run on the default window, which have only two buttons. \"Create\" and \"Restore\".\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Create Button. It will automatically scan your computers /var/cache/apt/archives folder for all .deb files. When scanning is completed, You will see a window similar to the below image.  \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can add additional packages in other folder if you have, such like the downloaded aptoncd package. Also individual packages can be selected.\n\n*After it completed it's process, Click on the \"Burn\" button, a new window will appear like the below one.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In this window, type the name of the iso file, where it should create that iso, and check \"Create a metapackage\" option it you want to install all the included packages be installed on the internet less system, with installing a single package. Click on the Apply button. \n\n*After some time, depending on the number of packages, it will ask you whether you want to burn the iso file now. You can burn CD/DVD now, but I'll select no. Check in home folder to see that an iso file is created.\nAdding the iso file as a source repository in the target computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the iso file in the target computer. I assume that, you copy it in your home folder and the name of the iso file is aptoncd.iso.\n\n*Open a terminal, and type sudo mount ./aptoncd.iso /media/apt to mount the iso in /media/apt directory. If it says, The directory does not exists, simply create one with this command sudo mkdir /media/apt, and then try mount again.\n\n*After mounting, run this command to add this new cdrom as repository source.\nsudo apt-cdrom add. If you see a message like Repeat this process for the rest of the CDs in your set. Then the process is successful.\nInstalling from the new aptoncd repository\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to install a package, simply mount the iso in /media/apt folder. (see above section).\n\n*Then open a terminal, and run sudo apt-get install package-name.\n\n\n\nlocal repository method.\nThere is a lot more easier method than using AptOnCD. Though I have included AptOnCD method as the question talked about that.\nCopy all .deb files into the target computer\nYou need to copy all .deb files you download from /var/cache/apt/archives folder to a suitable folder in your target Internetless computer. I recommend you to copy all the files in a folder named debs which itself resides in a folder named LocalRepo. Meaning, .deb files are in LocalRepo/debs folder. You can put the LocalRepo folder wherever you wish. Let say, for example, I have put it in my home directory i.e. /home/anwar. \nSo, the folder structure is like below:  \n\n-/\n -/home\n   -/anwar\n    -/LocalRepo\n     -/debs\n\nwhere debs folder contains all the deb files you downloaded.\nGenerate packages index file\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and go to the folder just above the Debs folder. In this example, it is /home/anwar/LocalRepo. \n\n*Run this command: while you are in LocalRepo folder.\napt-ftparchive packages . > Packages\nIt will create a Packages file in the LocalRepo directory.\nAdd your local repository in the repository source list\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /etc/apt/sources.list file with root privilege\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.\n\n*At the top of sources.list file, put a line like this.  \n deb file:/home/anwar/LocalRepo /\n\nreplace /home/anwar/LocalRepo with actual directory name where you put the LocalRepo folder.  \n\n*Save the file, and exit gedit.\nUpdate package indexes to be able to install from Local repo\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo apt-get update in a terminal, It will create a repository source list about available repositories. So, your newly created Local Repository will be recognized.\n\n\nInstall packages from local repository.\n\n\n*\n\n*Then run sudo apt-get install package-name\n(replacing package-name with actual package) to install your desired repository.\n\n\nNote: You will always be warned about being your repository is not \"Authenticated\" one. In this case you can ignore such warning, since you created repository from packages of \"Authenticated\" sources, meaning Official Ubuntu Package archive.\nYou can override this warning by putting --allow-unauthenticated switch in the command. such as \n sudo apt-get install --allow-unauthenticated package-name\n\n\nCreating a trusted repository instead:\nIf you want to create a trusted local repository, You should read this.

I guess there's a difference in where apt-get update and the notifications utility get their information from?  \nPlease help me sort this out.\n\nA: Some updates require more than a simple apt-get upgrade to install, and so you may not have gotten them installed, as they were held back. You can install them by running apt-get dist-upgrade instead.\n", "Q: How do I commit changes to a text file on button press? I've written a small app that creates a GUI for setting up uShare. Currently it depends heavily on the 'w' (write) and 'a' (append) functions to generate/edit ushare.conf file. But I've been trying to find a way for the app to store all the changes until a save button is pressed, and only then committing them to the actual file. I think that would be the best way of getting around having the user press enter every time they change any field (and indeed allow for GtkCheckButton).\n\nA: If you want to store configuration like this, what I recommend you do is to use the Python ConfigParser module. Please note you should ensure you store config files in ~/.config/<your-app-name>. You can store config like this:\nimport ConfigParser\nimport xdg.BaseDirectory\n\n# set the configdir to ~/.config/ushare\nconfigdir = os.path.join(xdg.BaseDirectory.xdg_config_home, \"ushare\")\n\n# check if the dir exists and if not, create it\nif not os.path.exists(configdir):\n    os.makedirs(configdir)\n\n# create configparser object\nconfig = ConfigParser.RawConfigParser()\ncfile = os.path.join(configdir, \"ushare.conf\")\n\n# add your config items - see the ConfigParser docs for how to do this\n\n# later in your app add this when the user presses the button to save the config:\n\nwith open(cfile, 'wb') as configfile:\n    config.write(configfile)\n\nPlease note: I didn't actually run this code and just wrote it here, but it should work fine.\n", "Q: Wireless networking with LINKSYS router WRT310n v.2 in 12.04 I just installed Ubuntu Precise Pangolin 12.04 yesterday. I'm very excited about the change! I've been using windows since I was 16 years old. I'm now 29.... Now, to business. \nI'm having trouble establishing a functional wireless connection with my current router (WRT310n) and the Linksys Wireless- G network adapter (WUSB54G v.4). Often times the network manager will even tell me that I have established a connection, but it won't get me on-line.

I was able to connect to the wireless network, but could not even ping the router, let alone any other host.  \nAfter I changed my WPA secured network's mode to be \"Wireless-G Only\" (Linksys WRT110 Router), my laptop was actually able to use the network.  It happened right away, I did not have to change anything on my laptop's configuration to get past the problem.\nThanks for posting the suggestion to change the Network Mode!  I would not have thought of that!  Cheers!\n\nA: I had an issue with my Linksys router (although it's a different one) and Ubuntu 12.04 too - the small network applet at the top of the screen said i was connected, but i couldn't even ping the router. It was miraculously solved after i set my router's \"Network Mode\" to \"Wireless G only\"... Let me know if this works!\n\nA: Well, after much toil and sorrow. I make it work, by simply resetting the WRT54G Linksys router to factory conditions and setting up just wpa with tkip and mac filter, and finally all working very well, so I think it's worth trying.

It is a hardware based solution, that despite graphics card limitations can create a multi-monitor environment. \n\nA: Extending monitors requires two things:  (1) having a system that can handle multiple monitors on its graphics cards, and (2) two separate monitors.\nAs well, your graphics card needs to support the feature.\nIf you have only one VGA port on your computer, a splitter will not work to help you.  Your system will need at least two VGA ports to handle each monitor separately.  And njallam has it right, a VGA splitter will not solve this, as a splitter sends the same signal across two cables.\n", "Q: Embed .avi video from file in Powerpoint 2010 (under Wine) I've been using Office 2010 with Ubuntu 12.04.  I would like to embed an video (.avi format) into a .pptx file in Powerpoint.  It was originally a .mov file, so I used avconv to convert the .mov file to a .avi file:\navconv -i input.mov -vcodec libx264 -crf 22 ouput.avi\n\nThis works fine.  But, when I try and embed output.avi into Powerpoint 2010, I get the following error:\nPowerPoint cannot insert a video from the selected file.  Verify the necessary codec for this media is installed, and try again.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on how to install the necessary codecs (in Wine?) or embed the video in my PowerPoint?  Thanks\n\nA: You'll have to convert the file using a Windows Media codec, rather than h.264. I don't think Office can embed h.264 video by default. If you install the appropriate codec package under wine, though, it should start working. \n", "Q: While browsing, why does my pc suddenly connect to sites using upper port numbers and unknown services?

Previously I only see  http or https on 80, 88, and 443 when browsing. Is this something that i should worry about?\nI use Firefox with Anonymox on Oneiric.\n\nA: No, this is normal.

Also, it seems like answers to other questions are dependent on certain situations. My situation being different from the others I found represented, here's my question.\nRecently, I had Ubuntu 12.04 installed with Wubi, and it ran ok, though slowly and with occasional hangs. So I partitioned the drive and installed 12.04 in its own partition.\nNow when I start it, I am stuck using 2D. I believe this is an NVIDIA bug. \nMy NVIDIA card is a GT 520M and my machine has Optimus.\nAdditional Drivers only displays my wireless driver.\nGoing to System Settings >> Details >> Graphics shows Driver:Unknown, Experience:Standard.\nI downloaded the driver from the NVIDIA website, and ran the installer with no errors, except that the \"distribution-provided pre-install script failed\".\nRebooted and my screen was stuck at 640X480, which was fixed by editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nHowever, I still was stuck in 2D, and nothing else had changed either.\nA thread suggested Bumblebee. I tried that, and when I ran optirun firefoxI got a frozen blank screen.\nAfter another suggestion, I checked the BIOS to try and disable Optimus.\nI found and ran myriad other commands to try and fix the problem with no change.\nI've just done a clean re-install of Ubuntu. From there, I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed all the updates\n\n*Downloaded the NVIDIA driver\n\n*Installed it\n\n*Got screen stuck at 640X480, fixed in xorg.conf. \n\n\nRecap:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't get the NVIDIA drivers working\n\n*I am stuck using 2D\n\n*I'm an idiot\n\n\nI think if the first one is solved, the second will naturally follow.

Tried them both, no go.  I tried the directions you linked to - there is no change.  nvidia-xconfig and nvidia-settings: done, done, and redone. No change.\nAlso worth noting I've since reverted all changes made following the instructions at that link.\n\nA: There is no official solution for NVIDIA Optimus on Linux. In order to make it work, try installing Bumblebee:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\n\nA: Some thoughts that might help address your issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to disable Optimus from your BIOS (Lenovo's let you do this)\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1467074 - Follow some of the steps here, obviously you did not install your drivers from the PPA, so you won't have to purge.\n\n*run sudo nvidia-xconfig from console\n\n*run nvidia-settings from console\n\n*If all else fails, uninstall the drivers you used ... I THINK, you'll have to google it, that it's sudo sh NVIDIA_[DRIVER BINARY FILE].sh --uninstall something along those lines, then install the PPA, just google \"12.04 nvidia driver\"\n\n\nA: OP posted:\n\nSolution found! Seemingly by random chance, once after of the many\nreboots last night, I got Unity 3D and additional drivers now listed\nthe two NVIDIA drivers. Then I was stupid enough to try and install\nthose drivers - broke it.\nHowever, that gave me hope, and a solution was found. I didn't get the\nNVIDIA drivers working, but I think I have working Nouveau drivers.\nEither way, Unity 3D is working perfectly.\nSteps I took:\n\n*\n\n*Yet another clean re-install.\n\n*Installed all the updates.\n\n*Opened terminal, ran apt-get purge nvidia-settings nvidia-current.\n\n*Reboot\n\n*And that got me Unity 3D and, I infer, working graphics drivers. Just in time too.\n\n\n", "Q: How to get Mobile Broadband modem (ZTE K3370-Z) work? I am a die hard Ubuntu user.

By typing a manually specified command in terminal I want to execute some other command.\nHow could add an alias to a command? Can i do that with the help of the terminal or should I edit some kind of file?\n\nA: To make permanent changes you can put your aliases separetely in ~/.bash_aliases\n\nA: alias new_name='old command'\n\nTo create a permanent alias you have to edit the .bashrc file in your home directory.\nMore info here\nMore .bashrc files here\n\nA: You can either use the alias built-in command in the shell you're using, or you can write a script which does what you want. Assuming you are using bash as the shell (which is the default), you can type man bash and skip down to the ALIASES section, for documentation on aliases in bash.\n\nA: On the bash command line it is simply a case of typing:\nalias my_command=\"Command to run\"\n\nFor example to create a short command run a long listing you could do:\nalias ll=\"ls -l\"\n\nThe quotes are not required if you are not adding switches to the aliased command.\n\nA: I write a GUI for adding/editing alias commands. You can also use it from commandline like this:\naddalias -add \"sinstall\" \"sudo apt-get install\"\n\nhttps://github.com/isamert/addalias\n\nA: To learn about aliasing: visit http://www.mediacollege.com/linux/command/alias.html\nTo make the changes permanent (i.e. to be read everytime you start a shell) add the alias commands you typed in the terminal to the file ~/.bashrc file.\n\nA: You can directly create a file in your home for collecting all the aliases .bash_profile by writing nano ~.bash_profile and simply write on the file the commands/shortcuts you want to create, for example:\nalias edbp='nano ~/.bash_profile'\n\nand then validate it sourcing the file, so running\nsource ~.bash_profile\n\nRemember that every time you modify your document you have to run again source ~.bash_profile\n\nA: Aliases' File\nAdd aliases to the file ~/.bash_aliases and create it if it doesn't exist. For example, I have:\n$ more ~/.bash_aliases\nalias trop='tree --dirsfirst -L 1'\n(...)\n\nAlias Help\n$ alias --help\nalias: alias [-p] [name[=value] ... ]\n    Define or display aliases.\n    \n    Without arguments, `alias' prints the list of aliases in the reusable\n    form `alias NAME=VALUE' on standard output.\n    \n    Otherwise, an alias is defined for each NAME whose VALUE is given.\n    A trailing space in VALUE causes the next word to be checked for\n    alias substitution when the alias is expanded.\n    \n    Options:\n      -p    print all defined aliases in a reusable format\n    \n    Exit Status:\n    alias returns true unless a NAME is supplied for which no alias has been\n    defined.\n\n", "Q: Is there a command line tool for smush.it?

If you don't want to start another instance, then run emacsclient instead of emacs and the file will be opened in the current instance instead.\n\nA: Previously, I would get the following error:\nWarning (server): Unable to start the Emacs server.\nThere is an existing Emacs server, named \"server\".\nTo start the server in this Emacs process, stop the existing\nserver or call `M-x server-force-delete' to forcibly disconnect it.\n\nSince I started having problem described in this question, this error message had not been coming up.  I managed to get it back though, and I did it by putting (server-start) in my ~/.emacs.  \n", "Q: Why is Resume from Sleep sometimes 5-10 seconds and other times 1+minutes? Sometimes, when i resume from sleep (otherwise known as opening my laptop lid, after putting it to sleep by closing it), it takes only 5-10 seconds or even less to come back to a password prompt.\nOther times, like just now, it took closer to a minute to actually come back.  I've seen it take close to two minutes to get back from a black screen.  I used to think when this occurred that the computer froze or otherwise ceased funcitoning in sleep mode and I then hard powerred off, now i've learned patience.\nIs this because it's going into suspend-to-disk mode perhaps rather than suspend-to-ram?  I am always plugged in, or usually such, when this happens, so i don't think it would have to suspend to disk.\nAlso, if it is suspend to disk that is causing this, perhaps a 'resuming' message could come on the screen to give me an indication what is going on?\nThanks for any guidance on how i can resolve this.\n\nA: Closing the lid will cause the machine to suspend to RAM. After you resume you can look at the kernel messages to see what part of the resume is taking so long.\nFor example:\ndmesg | grep \"PM: resume\"\n\n[   60.006935] PM: resume of drv:hub dev:1-1:1.0 complete after 177.408 msecs \n[   60.006945] PM: resume of drv: dev:ep_00 complete after 177.306 msecs\n[   60.006953] PM: resume of drv:usb dev:1-1.4 complete after 172.034 msecs \n[   60.006985] PM: resume of drv: dev:ep_81 complete after 177.417 msecs \n[   60.162766] PM: resume of drv:scsi dev:host1 complete after 334.403 msecs\n\nyou may be able to observe a device in the log that is taking too long to resume, which could be the root cause.  I suggest filing a bug against the \"linux\" package.\n", "Q: Dropbox install stuck at 99%, how do I fix it? (and any dpkg errors) I tried to install Dropbox using How to install Dropbox?, or with apt-get install nautilus-dropbox.\nDropbox loads until 99% and then hangs, causing the system to go to 100% cpu usage.\nIf I reboot or close the terminal, I sometimes get dpkg errors which prevent me from using apt-get or Software Center to perform any package management functions.\nI would like to resolve all these and just get Dropbox working. How do I do that?\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Note: This question is possibly answered in two parts:  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The accepted answer tells you how to install Dropbox.  \n  \n*But if you  have dpkg errors, see this answer before you use answer 1 to install Dropbox.\n  \n  \n\n\nA: There already is a bug filed: 1016559\nIf you have a LaunchPad account, don't forget to add your name to the bug.\nWork arounds are listed here.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Download the Dropbox .deb file from: https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx\n  \n*Open the .deb with Ubuntu Software Center and begin installation\n  \n*When you see the screen saying \"Start Dropbox to finish installation\", press CLOSE\n  \n*Install the dropbox daemon (nautilus-dropbox) using this command (from https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx):\ncd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86_64\" | tar xzf -\n\n[ for 32bit, just change detail to ?plat=lnx.x86 ]\n  \n*Restart computer\nNow you should have Dropbox working, including the notification icon\n  and the Dropbox icon overlays in Nautilus.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Forum thread on the Dropbox Forums\n\n*Another thread from the Dropbox forums\n\n\nA: If you have dpkg errors from trying to manually install, fix them first!\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo dpkg -r nautilus-dropbox\n\n\n*\n\n*You may get an error the first time, followed by a popup saying \"Dropbox requires Nautilus to be restarted -- just Close it.\n\n\n*Run sudo dpkg -r nautilus-dropbox again, and it should end with Removing nautilus-dropbox ...\nThat's it! Do a sudo apt-get update just to refresh everything. Then follow the steps in the accepted answer to successfully install Dropbox.\n\nA: I couldn't uninstall dropbox nor use sudo dpkg --configure -a because of a lock on dpkg base.\nTo resolve it I had to kill all dropbox processes (you can find them by using ps -a | grep dropbox) then use sudo kill -s 15 pid_of_dropbox. \nAfter that all problems I succeded to uninstall dropbox but it took me while to find how to do it. \n\nA: The accepted answer didn't work for me maybe because things have changed since or my situation was not exactly as the answer-providers? There was a missing step needed before it all came together. Maybe there's not a lot of difference as the Dropbox daemon would have started when the system was restarted as advised.  \nHowever, the Dropbox-recommended way gives immediate success feedback and is less Windowsy than the accepted answer. Hope this helps!\nThe instructions I reproduce below from the Dropbox website worked for me on Ubuntu Desktop 12.10\nInstall Dropbox via command line\nThe Dropbox daemon works fine on all 32-bit and 64-bit Linux servers. To install, run the following command in your Linux terminal.\n32-bit:\n    cd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86\" | tar xzf -\n\n64-bit:\n    cd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86_64\" | tar xzf -\n\nNext, run the Dropbox daemon from the newly created .dropbox-dist folder.\n    ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\n\n\nA: After you start Ubuntu, and you are at the login screen, you need to press Control Alt F1. You will then see a screen with a login prompt. Log into your account from there. Next, you will need to run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get -y install nautilus-dropbox &&\n sudo apt-get purge nautilus-dropbox\nThis will install Dropbox on your system, since it was not installed properly before and might not be removed correctly, and then fully Dropbox.\n\nA: Well, I had exactly the same problem; I also followed the link you gave and it didn't solve it for me! The thing is, that I did that 3 days ago and I don't quite remember the whole process very well. Sorry for this...\nThese are the steps I did and solved the problem (NOTE THAT  the fact that it worked for me doesn't mean that it will work for you!):\n\n*\n\n*Run this from the terminal (to open the terminal hit Ctrl+Alt+T):\n\n32 bit\nwget -O ~/dropbox.tar.gz \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86\"\n\n64 bit\nwget -O ~/dropbox.tar.gz \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86_64\"\n\n\n\n*Open nautilus to your home directory and untar the dropbox.tar.gz file\n\n\n*A hidden directory (.dropbox-dist) will be created. Click on the icon, right from your username on the upper right corner of your screen, and then click on startup applications. Click on add:\n\n\n\n*In the 'Name' field add 'Dropbox', and in the 'Command' field click on 'Browse...', then head to your home directory, give Ctrl+H to reveal hidden files, click on dropbox-dist and then select the file dropboxd. In the 'Comment' field, add whatever you want.\n\n\n*That is the part that I don't remember very well...Open a terminal and give\ncd ~/.dropbox-dist;./dropboxd\nIt will ask you for your account info as usual, I think, or it will say that dropbox isn't installed (and it will say to run dropbox -i start). Do whatever necessary (sorry :( i don't remember what I did) so as to fill your account info and such and to login into your dropbox account!\n\n\n*After all this, check if dropbox is running (open system monitor), and if it is, then stop it (kill it or whatever :D). Install hamster-indicator and set it to start on system startup.\n\n\n*Restart your computer!\n\n\n*Now you should have the dropbox running and a working indicator of it! You can now uninstall hamster-indicator (I told you to install it so as to have a working indicator, that's how I fixed mine!)\nSorry if this don't work for you....\n\nA: For 32 bit machines make sure to use:\ncd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86\" | tar xzf -\n\n... as indicated in the instructions.  I was not paying attention and thought the warning applied only to the original package downloaded from the dropbox web site, and had to redo the whole thing (the instructions provided above are for 64 bit).\nThe answer provided works if you follow the directions exactly. Other solutions, that I found elsewhere, did not work.  \n\nA: You can find the complete solution here.\n\nA: I (believe) followed all the instructions here and could not finish installing Dropbox correctly. I had read in a recent post in\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus-dropbox/+bug/1016559 \nthat the installation bug was fixed but apparently something I have done before is not permiting me to finis my installation.\nI even followed the purge instructions posted in \nhttp://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=62952\nbut still could not get Dropbox to run.\nWhen I followed the workaround and finally\ntyped ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd I got:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"__main__dropbox__.py\", line 16, in <module>\n  File \"explicit_imports.py\", line 11, in <module>\n  File \"ui/common/selective_sync.py\", line 12, in <module>\n  File \"arch/__init__.py\", line 24, in <module>\n  File \"arch/posix_common/util.py\", line 16, in <module>\nImportError: /home/ale/.dropbox-dist/netifaces-0.5-py2.5-linux-i686.egg/netifaces.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32\n\nI am running Ubuntu 12.04 on 3.2.0-26-generic kernel x86_64. \nSo I deleted the /.dropbox-dist/netifaces-0.5-py2.5-linux-i686.egg/ folder and now dropbox started and recognized everything.\n", "Q: How can i seperately change the workspace on my two screens? I have two different screens, one FullHD and one HDready and i often have openend many windows. To manage these, the Ubuntu workspaces do a good job, but it would be excellent if it could be changed seperately, so that i can have the windows on the right that are used less often but need a look on and those on the left that are needed to change often.\nSo i could have 8 workspaces and seperately choose one for every monitor. Is there anything like that?\n\nA: Gnome-Shell does this. If you are ok with using something non-unity, the right screen can switch desktops while the left does not (for me), although I am sure this is configurable. \n\nThis is my right monitor, while this\n\nis both my monitors. Notice there is no workspace switcher on the left monitor.\n(The workspace switcher is on the very right; it is minimized in the picture.)\n", "Q: Restore Keyboard Layout Icon and locale I'm an Ubuntu 12.04 user, using Gnome Classic (with no effects).\nI don't know what I did, but lately instead of the keyboard layout with the locale (for example, IT, UK and so on) a strange \"no access\" symbol appears.\nSee the linked image.\now can I restore the default keyboard icon and the language indicator?\n\nIssuing\nlocale -a\n\nin a terminal i get the following output:\nlocale -a\nC\nC.UTF-8\nen_AG\nen_AG.utf8\nen_AU.utf8\nen_BW.utf8\nen_CA.utf8\nen_DK.utf8\nen_GB.utf8\nen_HK.utf8\nen_IE.utf8\nen_IN\nen_IN.utf8\nen_NG\nen_NG.utf8\nen_NZ.utf8\nen_PH.utf8\nen_SG.utf8\nen_US.utf8\nen_ZA.utf8 \nen_ZM\nen_ZM.utf8\nen_ZW.utf8\nPOSIX\n\n\nA: Usually that symbol means a missing pixmap/image. I think either the keyboard icon image or the country-flags icons are missing. You can install dconf-tool with sudo apt-get install dconf-tool, open the dconf-editor then go to org>gnome>libgnomekbd>indicator and uncheck the show-flags option if it's checked. Log-out and log-in back again to see if the keyboard icon appears there.\n", "Q: What can I do when Ubuntu freezes for some unknown mysterious reasons? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 but of some unknown reason sometime Ubuntu get stuck, no motion what so ever. If i try to move a mouse it doesn't respond and same thing with the keyboard.\nI hope at least some one gives some reply bcoz I'm not getting replies on most of my questions.\n\nA: Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and log in with your username and password. Then type kill -9 -1. This will bring terminate all programs and services run as your user (while leaving system programs and services alone). Then switch back to the login screen with Ctrl+Alt+F7 and now you can login to your account.\nIf your work is not saved and you want to kill only frozen programs, rather than everything, then type top and look and see which is your frozen program, and to kill the process.\n\nA: Whenever my machine freezes I try to do CTRL+ALT+F5 or any of the F1-F6 keys to see if you can switch to another terminal instance.  If you can, then you can try and kill the unresponsive program from the terminal.  If you can't, which in your case with the mouse not moving is highly likely, then you may be having an issue unrelated to processes.\nIf the latter is the case then here's some good information for you:\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes?\n\nA: A few more details about the story of your machine might be helpful. For instance, is it a new Laptop? If not, did it use to work well before you installed 12.04?\nSo I just assume the Laptop is new. Based on my very personal experience, it might be that you are experiencing a RAM failure. I bought a Laptop and I installed Ubuntu (11.04 at that time) on it. I started experiencing some random freezes, like those you described (mouse cursor not moving, keyboard not responding). I turned out that it was an hardware problem and I had to give that Laptop back. Running a memtest might shed some light on your case.\n\nA: If Unity Freezes, You can just use this shortcut to find yourself at Login Screen again.  \nThe Shortcut key combination : ALT + PrtSc + K.\nHope this will answer your question.\nYou can also see this answer: What should I do when Ubuntu freezes?\n\nA: Guess some updates could be missing. First, type: \n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nin a Terminal [Ctrl+At+T]and thereafter see whether there are any updates available, via Update Manager (available from the top right hand gear icon). Also, you can select the best server for download of updates depending on your location (from Software Sources). Here, select what kind of updates are to be downloaded and installed. It is best if important security updates are allowed to be installed without confirmation. Installing regular updates may sometimes solve issues affecting performance.\n", "Q: Run a wine application fullscreen on a single monitor from dual-monitor setup I have a dual-monitor system, running Ubuntu 12.10 with Gnome 3 desktop. I want to run a fullscreen wine application on one monitor (I'll call it \"secondary\"), while another (\"primary\") will not be affected, and will continue to run regular Gnome desktop.\n\nI have to use wine virtual desktop (wine explorer /desktop=foo,1680x1050), because otherwise the second monitor gets turned off and application runs on primary one.\nHowever, virtual desktop's window does not occupy the whole sceen because of window decorations. I've removed them from maximized windows using this recipe, but the window is not maximized (although, it's resizable) and can't be maximized using its context menu.\nThere's no Gnome panel or any other obstacles on the secondary monitor. If I could get rid of decorations I'll achieve exactly what I want.\nIs there any way I could either forcibly maximize wine's virtual desktop window, or tell Metacity this window must be not decorated? Or, maybe, there's another approach?\nI've obviously tried winecfg's \"allow the window manager to decorate/control the windows\" options, but they don't seem to affect virtual desktop window. The application can't be run windowed by itself and always goes fullscreen.\nPlease note, I explicitly don't want to setup monitors as separate X11 displays, each running separate X server.\n\nA: There is an easy way to use a windowed mode in Wine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Wine Configuration (winecfg)\n\n*Click on the ‘Graphics’ tab\n\n*Check ‘Emulate a virtual desktop’\n\n*Next to ‘Desktop size’ enter your exact screen resolution.\n\nA: I found ~/.config/monitors.xml where you can set which monitor is the primary one (primary:yes) so wine displays Skyrim on my right monitor while my left one's still displaying unity and firefox :)\n", "Q: How do I establish a mobile broadband connection from the command line?

You can configure the connection by editing /etc/wvdial.conf:\n[Dialer Defaults]\nPhone = <dial-out number here>\nUsername = \nPassword = \nNew PPPD = yes\n\nTheir man-pages will be really helpful I think. man wvdial and man wvdial.conf for details.\n\nA: The CLI way\nThere are 3 files involved “/etc/ppp/peers/provider”, “/etc/chatscripts/pap” and “/etc/ppp/chap-secrets”.\n#/etc/ppp/peers/provider\n\nuser \"user\"\n\nconnect \"/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/pap -T *99#\"\n\n# Serial device to which the modem is connected.\n\n/dev/ttyUSB0\n\n# Try to get the name server addresses from the ISP.\n\nusepeerdns\n\n# Use this connection as the default route.\n\ndefaultroute\n\nreplacedefaultroute\n\n# Makes pppd \"dial again\" when the connection is lost.\n\npersist\n\n# no compression - ppp is used only until the modem\n\nnovj\n\nnovjccomp\n\nnopcomp\n\nnodeflate\n\nnoccp\n\n#debug\n\n“/etc/chatscripts/pap”:-\n    ABORT           BUSY\nABORT           VOICE\n\nABORT           \"NO CARRIER\"\n\nABORT           \"NO DIALTONE\"\n\nABORT           \"NO DIAL TONE\"\n\n\"\"              ATZ\n\nOK ATE0V1&D2&C1S0=0+IFC=2,2\n\nOK AT+CGDCONT=1,\"IP\",\"3internet\"\n\nOK ATDT*99#\n\nCONNECT         \"\"\n\n“/etc/ppp/chap-secrets”:-\n    # Secrets for authentication using CHAP\n# client        server  secret                  IP addresses\n\n3ireland        *       3ireland\n\nThe most important setting is for the APN in the chat script “3internet”, change this to suit your own provider. You may also need to change usernames and passwords. Until you are confident the connection is working correctly you may also want to enable debugging by uncommenting “#debug” in /etc/ppp/peers/provider.

I observed that vpnagentd does not load because of libatk1 and vpnui does not load because of libxml2. Installing the 32-bit versions of these libraries resolves the issues. You should install ia32-libs to resolve the issue using\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nThis should resolve the issue for you on Ubuntu 64 bit versions. I have tried it on Ubuntu 11.10 and Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: I just installed openconnect.

When you choose to add a connection, there'll be a new option under VPN Connections to add a \"Cisco AnyConnect Compatible VPN (openconnect)\". You can then connect to the VPN through the networks applet (in the system tray).\n\nA: Just in case you do want the Ciso Anyconnect client working take a look at this blog. \nJust disable the Firefox Iced Tea web plugin and go to your VPN site. Have Ubuntu download the VPN installer and run the shell script. \nIn my case Cisco Anyconnect VPN client was installed and available under the Internet section and works fine.\n\nA: In my casevpnagentd would not load.

When I woke up, it had finished downloading packages, and looked like it had just started installing. A few hours later, it was in the same place and everything seemed totally locked up. AFter about 3 hours of no movement, I decided to risk a reboot. Well, it didn't go so well. \nI've entered some sort of recovery terminal and hope there are some magic commands I can enter to finish the upgrade. \nIn the meantime I started a download of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on another computer. \nWhat do I do from here? If I end up needing to use the downloaded installer, how can I finish the upgrade using that? I have some very important files on this computer. Though they are backed up, it would still be a tremendous hassle if I can't access them.\nThanks!\nEDIT: If I need to go the use an installer file route, I'm downloading the file on a Mac. Can I just follow the instructions on the website to put it on a flash drive, or since I hope to use it to boot an Ubuntu computer do I need to go about things differently?\n\nA: The easiest route to a working computer is probably going to be a new install from CD or USB.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the ISO\n\n*Follow the instructions on the download page for burning it to USB/CD.\n\n*Boot into it, pick Try Ubuntu\n\n*Run around and rescue your old files. Stick them on an external disk or transfer them over the network. Whatever works for you, just keep them safe.\n\n*Then run the installer from the desktop.\n\n\nBy the time you get to the installer, you could choose to just install over the top (without wiping anything). This might work. It might not. Either way, you'll be left with cruft from the past install.\nI would just nuke the disk and do a completely fresh install and 20 minutes later when it's finished installing, just copy back my backed-up files.\n\nAlternatively, if you like pain without the guarantee of success you can try fixing it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold shift when booting to enter the grub menu\n\n*Select the rescue mode option\n\n*Select the root prompt with networking\n\n*Remount root with this: mount -o remount,rw /\n\n*Run dpkg --configure -a to finish the installation process. This assumes this part had started before it crashed. If it was still downloading packages it probably wouldn't have broken the entire system.\n\n\nA: Try booting from the install disk as a live disk. Then search for and install the Boot-Repair package. It may not show in the software list, but is downloaded from Canonical. Run this package to fix any boot problems that you may be having. You can also use it to create a log of your boot failures and it will upload it to pastebin and gives you a link. If your problems are still unresolved, copy the log data from pastebin here for more accurate results.\nReference: Boot-Repair\n", "Q: How do I change the indicator menu labels?

Then I downloaded EasyBCD for setting up my bootloader for XP.\nFrom then, I was able to boot XP or Vista.\nNext step was to reinstall grub2 on the partition where Ubuntu was installed (I don't know if this was necessary, but I did it before testing if EasyBCD was able to add the bootloader for Ubuntu) by using Super Grub2 disk to boot on it. Then, I used EasyBCD to add Ubuntu.\nNow, everything work fine, except for my ping in LoL... (it still doing those lags spikes in XP, so it must be my wireless antenna or something) Strangely, playing LoL using wine on ubuntu was giving me a stable ping on the same computer with the same hardware.\nAnyways, thanks for the help.\n\nA: You should install Vista, then XP, then Ubuntu (because Windows can be extra needy regarding partitions, and it can also overwrite your bootloader if you install Ubuntu before it).  \nHave you made sure that your XP disc is good and doesn't have a scratch on it?  During the actual installation process of XP, it shouldn't be relying on any of the information already on the hard drive, so that shouldn't cause a BSOD.  You might have some other hardware problem.\n\nA: Your Vista partition is 97% full. This may prevent it to boot. Remove >1Go of files (videos, music, images...) from it and reboot in order to check.\nIf Vista still doesn't boot, boot a Vista CD and type:\nbootrec.exe /fixmbr\nbootrec.exe /fixboot\n\nReboot. If you have direct access to Vista, it's perfect. Then use Boot-Repair to recover your GRUB menu.\n", "Q: How do I include basic image editing in my python application?

Most people can't figure it out and have never even heard of it (I have because I knew someone who ran it)!!  So how do I remove it?  Is there anyway to just do a virtual restore?  I'm hoping it was windows 7 on here previously cause don't most 7 systems have a built in windows installation disk iso?  Anyone know how or if this can be fixed??  No we don't have the re-installation disks (if we did I would know the system and not have a problem) HELP!!!!\n\nA: It sounds like you got confused with Ubuntu and Ubuntu One.  To remove Ubuntu one (this is from my old answer):\n\nIf you only want to remove Ubuntu One, type these in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get purge ubuntuone\\*\n\nUbuntu One will be removed.  If you don't know what Ubuntu One is,\n  read here.\n\nTo remove Ubuntu:\nIf the System on your computer is a Dual-Boot system, Read my answer\nsomewhere else for steps to remove ubuntu. \nIf you only have Ubuntu on those computers and you didn't clone your disk drive with a program like Clonezilla to backup, then sorry, you will need an Windows installation\n disk.\nIf (too many If's) you don't really have a Windows Installation CD, then you will just have to try and use Ubuntu.  Many Windows users hate Ubuntu at first, but after days of using it they feel more comfortable about it and liked it more than Windows.\nAnd Windows 7 Computers usually comes with a Recovery Partition, not an installation ISO, since the manufacturer have to pay Microsoft a Windows Licence fee for every computer they sell.\n\nA: Ubuntu One is ubuntu's cloud storage solution.\nSounds like you just want rid of the Ubuntu operating system. Unfortunately unless you have some kind of restore image of the previous system you can't just undo the install. Maybe the system is dual booted in that you may be able to boot into Windows by rebooting the system and choosing windows at the bootloader. \nIf not then you may need to reinstall Windows using the disks that would of came with your computer.  If you cannot find them then call Microsoft they will gladly sell you some new ones. \nOr you can just learn to use Ubuntu it's way better than windows and there's plenty of help around if you need it.\n", "Q: Alternate between windows on launcher click There is no way to set unity to change between opened windows by clicking on the laucher incon?\nEverytime I want to change a window of the same program I have to use the keyboard!\n\nA: There is not, exactly.

I saw that it is possible through rsyslog with ruleset.\nhow is it possible to do it by sysklogd?\n\nA: I don't believe the functionality is available.  Looking at my 12.04 virtual servers it looks like rsyslogd has replaced sysklogd as the default logger.  I replaced it earlier on my server because I wanted the additional filtering available in rsyslogd.\nStandard syslog filtering is done on facility and priority.  Neither of these is host specific.   If it is possible to specify the facility your router logs as, you could use an unused local facility to fake the separation you are looking for.\n", "Q: How do I return to a previous kernel?

However, it backs up at most once every 24 hours (daily). Is there any way to have a backup system in Ubuntu that backs up a file every time it's changed?  \nAlso: Could and/or would it make sense for a file-level backup system make use of ext4's journaling features? Or am I misunderstanding ext4 as a \"journaling filesystem\"?\nEDIT: Perhaps ext4 journaling is ill-suited for this task. In that case, is there software that runs a daemon tracking real-time file changes, and backs up accordingly? \n\nA: *\n\n*Take a look at bup. It's a git-based backup software, which is in an early stage, but looks very promising and last time I checked, they did plan to implement a file notification based backup system. I guess it's best to check out the mailing list for the current status.\nedit: I forgot to mention, there's a gui available, named Kup.\n\n*Another possible tool is inosync, which actually supports inotify-based realtime backups in combination with rsync.\n\nA: Do not confuse a \"journaled filesystem\" with a \"backup system\".\nA journaled filesystem is more robust, is journaled to keep track of the variations on the filesystem and, in case something goes wrong, recover that filesystem.\nThis has nothing to do with your data on that filesystem, you can loose your data and have a perfectly healty filesystem fully recovered.\nTo answer your question i think that a cron job and rsync could be the tools that you need.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/rsync\n", "Q: Ubuntu Crashes at Boot I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 7 and was having trouble changing brightness.

The installation went smooth, but after rebooting it directly booted into Windows 7. When I inserted the USB device it showed the grub menu. I suppose the boot loader got installed on the USB device.\nCan any one give me a solution to this?\n\nA: From your booted Ubuntu system, open a terminal, then use the following commands to install grub to the internal drive :\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdX\n\nsudo update-grub\n\nReplacing sdX with the actual drive, which will probably be sda, but use disk utility to double check if you are unsure.\n", "Q: System will not boot without USB thumb drive inserted I've had this issue before when trying out Linux Mint, but I was unable to get any assistance.

For a single disk system I'd expect that should be hd0.  Assuming your UUIDs are correct, boot up with the stick, change the permissions on /boot/grub/grub.cfg to include w (sudo chmod +w grub.cfg), edit the file (sudo vi grub.cfg) and change every hd1 to hd0.  save it, shutdown, remove the stick and reboot.  At the grub menu, you may check the disks available -- enter c for the grub command line, then type \"set root=\" then tab for autocompletion.  Multiple choices will be offered if available, but if only hd0 is available, it will be filled in to \"set root=hd0,\"  another tab will offer the partition choices, which should include the ones you want.  Maybe the fix of editing the hd1 to hd0 would work directly from the grub menu, type e to edit, and change the hd1 s then F10 (or ctrl X)to reboot.

Upgrading the driver usually involves upgrading the entire stack, from the kernel to the X server. Driver-only upgrades are possible, but you don't get the full benefits of the upgrade since some improvements depend on changes to a different part of the stack.\nFirst of all, I would discourage upgrading if there is no good reason to do so. Your driver version is current, so you may want to double-check with this person in the forum in case they made a mistake or meant something else. There are very good reasons why each Ubuntu release sticks to a given version of its packages instead of constantly releasing them in the archives, the relevant point being that you get a new well-tested software stack every 6 months, which in my opinion strikes excellent balance between stability and how long you have to wait for new software versions.\nNow if you are absolutely sure you want to upgrade your graphics stack, visit:\n\n\n*\n\n*This PPA which will upgrade your driver, bringing your Intel driver from the 2.17 version in precise to 2.19\n\n*The xorg-edgers PPA which will upgrade your entire graphics stack, including the 2.19 Intel driver, plus mesa 8.1, linux 3.5 and a large number of other packages\n\n\nMore importantly, be aware of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*PPAs can be uninstalled with ppa-purge\n\n*If your installation is 64-bit, bear in mind that ppa-purge does not get along well with precise's multiarch (see note at top of xorg-edgers PPA, which states the situation a bit more dramatically), and the uninstallation of a PPA may force you to uninstall a bunch of unrelated i386 packages\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation got hanged This is my first ever attempt at working with Ubuntu.

Then, right click on your USB device and choose Rename. Give your desired name and Press Enter.\n", "Q: Do \"package\" and \"application/software/program\" mean the same thing? Are these words used interchangeably in Linux?\n\nA: \nNote: This answer is restricted to Ubuntu/Debian.\n\nIn general, no, they do not mean the same. A \"package\" is like an installer; it's a DEB file, much like MSI files in Windows. \nUnless the application is relatively small, it will usually be assembled from multiple packages, with each package containing one (sometimes more) components of the program. These components can be binaries (executables), libraries, help files (man pages) and even source code.\nConversely, some packages will install multiple small programs (binaries), and others will \"collect\" multiple related programs under one umbrella for ease of installation (meta-packages), but these are the exception rather than the rule.\nIn short: since most programs are made up from more than one package, they are not the same. :-)\n\nA: Software is a collection of Programs.\nWhen that Software is used for performing a particular task , we say its an Application.\nNow relating these terms for Linux- Ubuntu specifications.\nPackage is a specific piece of software which the system can install and uninstall.\n\nRestricting to Ubuntu/Debian.\n\nPackages are basically of two types :  Binary packages and Source packages .\nSince they require more developer friendly knowledge due to compilation and dependency technicalities , .deb  was developed to provide simple installation and un-installation functions compared to Window MSI or .exe formats.\n(.deb)ian package,is used by Debian and Ubuntu.\ndpkg (lower level) and apt(higher level) forms its Package Management system (PMS) used to install them.\n.deb package contains meta-information such as a package description, version, and dependencies which allows PMS , to perform an automatic upgrade to a newer version, to check that all dependencies of a package are fulfilled and/or to fulfill them automatically.\nFor example : sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop.\nWhere Ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package use to install the basic desktop applications required by the default desktop using apt PMS .\nsource : for .deb,PMS, APT, dpkg.\n\nA: In the perspective of Ubuntu and Debian. \nNo, they are not the same thing. Package usually refers to the individual components of a full featured software. Where Software/Application/Program usually refers to  a full featured software which can be used standalone.\nLet's take an example:\nThen default file browser in Ubuntu (unity) is Nautilus. We usually refer to this as \"Software\" or \"Application\", since they can be used for a specific needs i.e browsing files.\nBut this Nautilus Application or Software depends on various small components, which usually do not provide a full feature individually, but they can be used together to build up a Software, which can provide full feature (browsing files/folder) individually.\nyou can see what packages nautilus depends on, by running this command in a terminal :\napt-cache depends nautilus\n\nHope this will help \n", "Q: Is there supposed to be a Windows Network folder in the file manager? I pulled my hard drive out of my computer and started with a bootable usb version of Ubuntu, which I am using that at this point.\nAt first boot, I see that there is a Windows folder when browsing network.  Since there is no operating system present, besides the usb that I boot from, should there be a Windows network folder?\nOriginal question\nFirst of all I just want to say, I wish I had tried Ubuntu a couple years ago when I first heard about it, but I was like a lot of the population and went with the \"easy way\" and stuck with Windows because I didn't want to take the time to learn something new. Well, about 3 months ago I realized someone had hacked into my computer, and then found they had hacked my facebook account so I decided I had better do a complete credit check. I found student loans (totalling about 30,000 so far) had recently showed up on my credit report. I think it's going to be a long, long road to recovery now but I'm hoping Ubuntu will be a start and definitely an eye opener. My relationship with Windows is over. I had 3 antivirus programs running, none were protecting me like I thought they were. Turned out a free program that I downloaded was the only one that could detect and clean the virus, but by then it was too late.\nAnyhow, my question is, I pulled my hard drive out of my computer and started with a bootable usb version of Ubuntu, which I am using that at this point. At first boot, I see that there is a Windows folder when browsing network. Since there is no operating system present, besides the usb that I boot from, should there be a Windows network folder? I am using a local ISP (and won't be much longer because I am very paranoid at this point) and I want to make sure all is ok before I put my new hard drive in and install Ubuntu.\nAny help would be appreciated. Also, I want to thank Ubuntu and the community for giving people an alternative.\n\nA: Are you seeing the  Windows Network folder in the Browse Network \n\nIf so this is normal, it is the folder where the information goes that allows Ubuntu to connect to an existing Windows network.  If your really paranoid, click it and see that it is empty unless you have other computers on a home network then you will see them by their computer names.\nAddressing other things you mentioned:\nYour ISP has little to nothing to do with any problems you had, you somehow downloaded a file that contained a virus, so you need not change it.  Your ISP only connects you to the web,  to think that your ISP could be responsible is like blaming the phone company if you dial a number wrong and end up on a sex line.   \nB.T.W running more than one virus program at one time is highly discouraged, they can conflict with each other and counteract one another.\nYou do not need to buy a new hard drive.  If you are going to install Ubuntu as your only OS you will select the option to Replace  Windows during installation the disk will be reformatted effectively wiping all data so any virus present will be destroyed.  In any case any Windows viruses can not run on Linux, the file systems are too different.\n\nA: Willing to learn\n\nI didn't want to take the time to learn something new\n\nIn my opinion that is one of the 3 things I say that people need to be willing to do in order to use Ubuntu (when coming from a Windows environment): 1. The wish/will to learn something new, 2. to ask a question if they don't know the answer or way to find/fix something and 3. to file a bug report if they see something went wrong with their favourite program in order to make it better. On behalf of the community, welcome aboard, we hope that we can ease your stay!\nIn order to stay secure\n\n\n*\n\n*Stick with the official software repositories (Or ask someone before you install any third-party software repositories, may they be Launchpad PPAs -- personal package archives -- or other). For example, install the ubuntu-restricted-extras package before trying out any other third-party repository that provides codecs and whatnot.\n\n*Use \"https\" secure http connections, a firefox addon called HTTPS Everywhere will redirect every website (from its list) to a safer https connection. https encodes and encrypts your connection to the server and people can't see your password or username when you submit it to the server.\n\n*Don't trust each email you receive, it might be spam (use your logic for that, no organization will ask for your password or your important data if you didn't ask first -- unless they got hacked that is, which happened recently to a website, Linkedin but for that you can browse the news and see if it's true).\n\n*Update regularly -- Update your software regularly through Update manager and/or change the settings in Software sources to download and install the security updates.\n\n*Ubuntu releases have an end of life (EoL) -- they are discontinued after a period of time, so no security updates are available after a specific date. If you don't upgrade to a newer release, you'll end up being unsafe. You can see which releases are \"Stable\" or which have been marked as \"End of Life\": https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases -- Ubuntu 12.04 will be supported until April 2017.\n\n*Change all your passwords since the incident. Use passwords with 7+ characters, dots, stars, slashes, mixed UPPERcase and lowercase letters etc. Make it HARD for them to hack you, don't use your name or 123 as a password.\nExample: You like yoghurt ice cream with 2 cups and you hate donuts and coffee -- 2Yoghurt//donuts+coffee -- That's an example, mix the letters with some numbers in between. Here's a website to help you do that: https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=check+password+strength+online or try http://www.hammerofgod.com/passwordcheck.aspx (shows up years it takes to crack a password by guessing letters) -- don't use your actual future password, use something similar.\n\"Windows\" folder in network\n\nAt first boot, I see that there is a Windows folder when browsing\n  network. Since there is no operating system present, besides the usb\n  that I boot from, should there be a Windows network folder?\n\nIf I understood correctly you clicked on the Network and you saw a \"Windows\" folder.\nThis is what I see when I click on my network:\n\nEach computer that is connected to the same network group will show up there. The only one currently is myself (savvas-laptop) and no-one else. The folder \"Windows network\" is a folder that helps you browse and interconnect with other computers that use Windows. It's not a network computer, it's not an entity.\nIf you share folders with other people, they will show up under your network name. The program/package samba can be installed from the official repositories and it exists to help you: 1. share folders through the so-called \"Samba\"/Windows network and 2. when connecting/using network printers.\n", "Q: How to get backup for particular Ubuntu user? I lost my Ubuntu root password and now , i just want to get it by doing changes on sudoers file but before this I would like to get backup of my working Ubuntu user-profile due to safety purpose of data and software's .\nDoes anybody know how to do it , if so please share the information .\n\nA: Backups are always good to have.  That is probably why there is a simple backup utility in the settings window, under \"system\".  Tell it to back up a folder, and select you home directory, tell it where to backup, and it's done.\nBut why compound you original error by making more errors?  You might be able to get it to work, but it would be better to understand what you did, and the proper way to fix it.\nI don't believe you when you say you lost your ubuntu root password; first of all, if you knew enough to actually create a usable root password, you would already know how to create a new one the same way.  But you don't need a root password, which is why Ubuntu does not provide one by default.\nI suspect what you may have done is somehow either deleted the admin group, or removed yourself from it.  Doing this will take away your ability to use sudo.  If this guess is correct, the solution is not to edit the sudoers file, but to add yourself back to the admin group.\nIf you edited the sudoers file and messed that up, then you do need to edit the file to restore it back to what it was.\nMost of these things are accomplished following these directions.  It's mostly standard Unix/Linux commands that are easy to find lots of information.\nThen again, perhaps you already do know what to do, in which case... good luck, and feel free to ask for advice before destroying your system rather than after. :)\n\nA: All the files for every user are placed in /home/username directory.

I wanted to move away from Windows because I've been learning Python for the last year and wanted to be on an OS that was good for Python development.  Ubuntu and Python are rather simpatico, hence the move.\nWell, as you might guess from the title, I've had a few issues involving the nvidia card.    For one, I get a false positive GPU hang until I went and did this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I ran sudo nano /etc/defaults/apport.\n\n*Editing this file, I set enabled=0.\n\n\nThis eliminated the error message and allows me to use the computer.  But beyond this, I have also never been able to get the ancient GPU and Ubuntu to play nice.\nI've tried two separate solutions, only to have the same thing happen both times; an unbootable computer.  I've tried to:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nI've also attempted to install the .run packages for nividia-173, and walking through the motions of killing the X server session and trying to install in this way, etc...  They both lead to the same black screen on start up.  I get a momentary purple screen, then nothing.  I'm forced to restart with GRUB and when I do, slow computer is slow.  \nThe thing of it is, even when I go back and \"sudo apt-get purge\" all the non-working things, I still reboot to a splash screen, momentary Ubuntu purple, and eventual black screen.  So whatever it is that these drivers are going and doing once I let them snake in, they're doing a good job of borking everything right up, because uninstalling doesn't seem to matter one bit.\nNow, I know I'm doing all this on an older box.  It's a Dell Dimension 2400, running a 2.4 Ghz Celeron processor and 1 GB RAM, and I also know the graphics card is something of a dinosaur (to compliment the prehistoric computer, of course).  So I'm willing to submit that maybe I'm just asking too much of an old bird.  I'd post the exact specs, but I can't, because right now that computer is in the middle of the third re-install of Ubuntu 12.04 in two weeks.\nI've also seen the nvidia issue seems to be pretty well-traveled by now, and honestly there's so much different information out there and varied results from the outcomes that honestly I don't know what to try right now, except just leaving the blasted thing alone and running it without the drivers.\nThe problem here is, I don't know what I'm supposed to know in order to troubleshoot this stuff, so I don't rightly know the right questions to ask, but at this point I'm wondering if I should just look into an older version of Ubuntu.  The computer was running Windows XP until I decided to be bold and jump ship; it wasn't blazing fast, but it worked.  And if my research and memory serve me correctly, this issue involving this particular configuration didn't pop up until, what, Ubuntu 11?  If I roll-back to try and correct this issue, am I doing it weird?\nI haven't written but five lines of code since I started mucking around with my OS.  I did this so I could code more, not less.  I'm frustrated and sad and annoyed that my experience with non-proprietary operating systems has thus far been fraught with bad drivers, three reinstalls, and a steep learning curve.  Whatever advice the community has for me at this point, I'm all ears here.\nEDIT: Got the old girl up and running.

answer: How to install drivers for NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 on Precise\nHowever, I want to make sure I do this correctly.\nFirst of all, I'm not quite sure how to read the launchpad site: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-173-updates/173.14.35-0ubuntu1/+build/3597638 - what do I grab, the binary or the built file?  Do I want/need to do this through my browser, or would apt-get be better (and if it is, precisely what steps do I take to install this file)?  Basically, how do I read this webpage and how do I know what to download?\nAdditionally, I've heard tell that nvidia's drivers \"mutilate the free Xorg/mesa-stack beyond recognition\" and make a hardware swap more difficult than they need to be.  I don't see myself removing the card or really plunking much money into this old beast, so I don't think I care about this, but in the event that I need to undo whatever it is that I'm contemplating doing, what's the right way to do it?  I'm pretty sure that if I'd just known a little more about what I was getting into the first couple of times around, I would not have needed to reinstall Ubuntu three times in a week.\nI really, really like this OS.  I just want to learn to use it right and not pebkac it into perdition.\n\nA: The nvida 173 is not updated to work with 12.04. As from 12.04 its using new xorg server.\n I am suffering in same problem for old desktop pc which has nvdia chipset (NVIDIA GeForce 7050/nForce 610i). So until nvidia updates (it is not going to happen any sooner) you should stick to open source driver or consider to move to lubuntu. Or you can go back to oneric (ubuntu 11.10) at least. \nLubuntu working flawlessly and my old grandpa pc is very pleased with it.\nIf you are having black screen till now. Just remove all nvia-drivers. There should be an nvidia-uninstall utility if you have downloaded .run file from Nvidia server. Then remove the xorg file. Ubuntu will create one. \nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nA: The good reassuring way to fix this issue is to replace some basic hardware to start with.\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase a newer CPU than the original Intel 4 that came with the machine.(Upgrade CPU)\n\n*Purchase 2-1 GB Ram sticks giving you 2 GB of RAM.\n\n*Purchase 1 modern/newer video card of your choice to install into slot on motherboard.\n\n*Replace 32 GB hard drive (if that's what you are currently using) with 40-80 GB hard drive or higher. (More GB the better).\n\n\nInstall all applicable mentioned hardware above into designated slots/inputs on machine and mother board then restart your machine.\nAfter restarting your machine connect to the internet and let any automatic updates run and install (always do a restart when prompted to do so and allow the machine to restart during automatic updates process).  This should install all and any or most of the up to date software drivers for the new hardware installed.  After automatic update is finished restart and check for updates in the start menu.  If any show run them and restart machine again.\nWith the upgraded hardware equipment and drivers updated and installed on your PC, it should run the 1024 by 768 true color and you should be able to adjust your resolution to what you want with no more video graphics issues.\nGod Speed Brother,\nComp.Doc8607 \n", "Q: How to install Intel graphics for Dell Inspiron 1545 Laptop Whenever I start any game (e.g. Max Payne 2), A message like \"Install your video card drivers\".\nMy laptop configuration is:\n\n\n*\n\n*DELL Inspiron 1545\n\n*OS: Ubuntu 12.04\n\n*Processor: Intel Core2 Duo T6400\n\n*15.6 WLED Display (1366x768)\n\n\nPlease tell me the way to install Intel graphics for Ubuntu 12.04 on Dell Inspiron 1545 Laptop....\n\nA: Intel graphic drivers are installed during OS installation.  \nYour problem in likely that you need the libraries for texture compression installed- they are not installed by default due to copyright issues.  They are needed for nearly all 3D games.  With the libraries missing, I suspect that the game thinks the drivers are not there because the game is looking for S3TC support. Without the libraries, the card will not advertise S3TC support hence the game will crash.\nRunning the following will install the libraries:\nsudo apt-get install libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0\n\nor just search for libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0  in the Software Center.\n", "Q: How to disable/enable automatically connecting to WiFi? Whenever I restart my WiFi router, Ubuntu tries to connect to my neighbours' WiFi networks. There's over 30 wireless networks in the area. Ubuntu prompts me for the password to all of those. This is annoying.\nIs there a way to stop Ubuntu trying to automatically connect to WiFi networks?\n\nA: Click on Wi-fi Icon >> Edit Connections >> Then, Click On Wireless Tab, Delete The Wireless Connections That You Don't want to Use or You Want Ubuntu To Stop Automatically Connecting To Them.\n\nA: I'm updating this answer to reflect new images, since this was done on a laptop.  \nClick on the wireless icon on the top bar as shown in the image below, and \n\nThen clock on Edit Connections.\n\nOnce the window opens, click on the wireless tab, and then click on the Edit button.\n\nUnckeck the connect automatically radio button, and click Save.  At this point you need to reboot your system\n\nOnce rebooted, you can see from the image below, that the wireless network is not connected.  You have to enable it to be able to use it.\n\nNow the wireless network can be enabled/disabled from terminal, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below to list all devices.\nrfkill list\n\nTo block wireless, you type:\nrfkill block <device_number>\n\nTo unblock you type:\nrfkill unblock <device_number>\n\nas shown in the image below.\n\n\nA: It seems like a gaping security hole, but Ubuntu does not seem to have a means of preventing connection to open networks while continuing to connect to those that you have designated safe (by checking the \"automatically connect\" button as others have described).\n", "Q: How to update dropbox in Xubuntu 12.04?

Just specify how big (pixels) you want the image to be:\n pixbuf = Pixbuf.new_from_file_at_size(size_x, size_y, filename)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Using scale_simple() does not preserve aspect ratio.\n\n*Using new_from_file_at_size() preserves aspect ratio\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. Your answer almost worked for me, but I got the following errormessage:\nAttributeError: 'gi.repository.Gdk' object has no attribute 'INTERP_BILINEAR'\n\nBut I found the definition of it here gtkmm:gdkmm Enums and Flags:\nGdk::InterpType { \n  Gdk::INTERP_NEAREST, \n  Gdk::INTERP_TILES, \n  Gdk::INTERP_BILINEAR, \n  Gdk::INTERP_HYPER \n}\n\nSo for me it worked when I called the function like this:\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, Gdk\nfrom gi.repository.GdkPixbuf import Pixbuf\n...\npixbuf = Pixbuf.new_from_file('mypic.gif')\npixbuf = pixbuf.scale_simple(desired_width, desired_height, 2) # 2 := BILINEAR\n\n...maybe this helps someone with the same problem ;)\n", "Q: Which default.list should I modify for default applications and what are the differences between the two? I would like to add miro to the default application GUI in system settings/default applications. I added ;miro.desktopnext to all rhythmbox.desktop entries eventually discovering if it was not added to audio/x-vorbis+ogg=rhythmbox.desktop as audio/x-vorbis+ogg=rhythmbox.desktop;miro.desktop it would not appear in the system settings/default applications drop down list for audio. \nI can find default.list in either \n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/gnome/defaults.list or \n\n*/usr/share/applications/defaults.list\nModifying either gives me the same results.\nFurther reading and i found that GNOME splits the settings for default application in system-wide and user specific settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*System wide application assignments can be found in /etc/gnome/defaults.list.\n\n*User specific in ~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list.\n\n\nSo i understand that if i right click/open with/set as default it will make changes to my ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list and will be associated with that user. I suppose i could even create a defaults.list in ~/.local/share/applications/ but since both changes made in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list and /etc/gnome/defaults.list are system wide i'm not sure which is the correct way. What is the difference between the two and which is the correct list to modify?\n\nA: If you want to have your changes show up in System Settings, then you will have to edit /etc/gnome/defaults.list.\ngksudo gedit /etc/gnome/defaults.list \n\nIf you press Ctrl+H, it will bring up a dialog for search and replace. In Search for, enter:- rhythmbox. In Replace with, enter:- miro.\nAnd either log-out or reboot and you will have replaced all instances of Rhythmbox with Miro. You can of course do this manually if you want to keep some of Rhythmbox's defaults.\nAlso anything you do in .local/share/applications/mimeapps.list will only be for that user.\n\nA: First thing:\n/usr/share/applications/defaults.list\nis a symbolic link to\n/etc/gnome/defaults.list\nSecond thing:\n\"*.desktop\" files contains in it the mime-types that the program supports. So if \"miro\" application can handle \"audio/x-vorbis+ogg\" mime-type files, \"miro.desktop\" should contain this mime-type in it. Then \"miro\" application will appear as a candidate to run this mime-type files.\nThird thing:\nIf there are more than one application supporting the same mime-type, you can decide which one will be used by default just including it at \"/usr/share/applications/defaults.list\", so in this case just replace:\naudio/x-vorbis+ogg=rhythmbox.desktop\n\nwith:\naudio/x-vorbis+ogg=miro.desktop\n\nIt CANNOT be two \"defaults\" applications.\n", "Q: Gnome3.4 looks like old gnome I set up a complete new Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

The easiest way I know to do this: Open nautilus -> Click on the partition to mount in the left pane (If you don't see the left pane, activate it by using F9 key). \nOnce the partitions are mounted, you can access them from /media directory. /media is the directory where the mounted devices like usb pendrives, partitions etc. are present as a part of filesystem tree. The partitions are treated just as another directory you create usin mkdir command. \nSo after mounting the drives, Opne the terminal: \n\n\n*\n\n*Type \ncd /media;\n\n*Type ls (to see the mounted partitions)\n\n*Use cd command to enter the drives(partitions). Its just another directory for you. Use commands like cp, mv, ls and any other command you would use to manipulate other files normal in directories.\nNOTE: If you want to mount the partitions too from command line you can use mount command to mount them \nUse something like sudo mkdir /media/drivex; mount /dev/sda[number] /media/drivex; [number]=the partition number you want to access.\n\n", "Q: Can no longer position windows with keyboard (Compiz Grid feature broken) Problem description\nThe compiz grid feature just stopped working a couple of days ago: for instance I used to be able to move a terminal window to the top left corner by pressing <ctrl><alt>KP7 but now the number 7 appears in the terminal and the window doesn't move.\nTroubleshooting\n -compiz grid is enabled and I have restored its configuration to the default values\n-my numpad is working properly (i.e. if it's locked I get the numbers, if not I get home, ins, del... as expected).\n-I looked into the Keyboard and Keyboard layout settings but I don't see any option I could tweak to fix the problem.\nWhat do I need to do in order to restore the compiz grid feature?\n\nA: Turns out issue was caused by a combination of factors:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Compiz (at least its grid component) requires Ubuntu 3D desktop (if you run $ echo $DESKTOP_SESSION inside a terminal and get ubuntu 2d it means you're not running the 3d desktop).\n\n*I couldn't run the 3d desktop because my Nvidia card was not being properly supported with the default drivers (which I solved by installing the BumbleBee drivers).\n", "Q: UbuntuStudio 12.04 does not boot after install - no \"intrd\" image After installing Ubuntu Studio 12.04 from DVD onto the fourth hard disk, it fails to boot, even when explicitly choosing the fourth hard disk as the boot device.\nI have SUSE 11.2 on the first 2 SCSI disks (which form a RAID) and Studio64 on the 1st IDE disk (that is, the third disk).\nLooking at the /boot directory on the Ubuntu partition, I see there is no initrd image.\nEditing the GRUB configuration file to include (hd3,1)/vmlinuz and of course (hd3,1)/initrd should fix the problem.

Doing so, does not mount the partition with executable permission, which is required for firefox to be able to execute the file.\nThe solution:\nThe easiest solution without using /etc/fstab file is this:\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and type sudo blkid, give password.\n\n\n*From the output of the command, see the type of the partition by looking at the corresponding label, i.e common.\n\n\n*If common partition happen to be /dev/sda2 , mount that partition with the command:\n  udisks --mount /dev/sda2 --mount-options umask=022  \n\nreplace, /dev/sda2 with the actual partition number.\nYou should now be able to execute/run the files using \"Firefox\".\nNote: You should unmount the partition before using the command. You can unmount it by right-clicking on the partition icon, and select \"unmount\" from the options\n\nA: Well, from what i can tell, chmod won't work on directories the way you use it- you really should try chmod -R 777 /path/to/main/directory/ to make it recursive. Then again, You don't want 777 for most things - but the exact permissions level would depend on your setup - I just hand over ownership to www-data and run things with 755 - which dosen't let non owners write, but gives full read/execute powers.\nAmusingly the error messages should have given most of this away. For a better writeup on how to set permissions, see this question on webmasters.se\n", "Q: Specify JDK for tomcat7 I have installed tomcat7 (using apt-get install) and whenever I want to start tomcat7 it says :\n* no JDK found - please set JAVA_HOME\n\nI have set JAVA_HOME in my bash.bashrc and also in ~/.bashrc and when I issue echo $JAVA_HOME I clearly see that this variable is pointing to my jdk's root folder. Can someone help me with this please?\nThanks\n\nA: Tomcat will not actually use your JAVA_HOME environmente variable, but look in some predefined locations and in the JAVA_HOME variable set inside the startup script, as other answers point out.\nIf you don't like messing with the tomcat startup script, you could create a symlink for your preferred java installation, which will be picked up by tomcat.\nFor example:\nln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle /usr/lib/jvm/default-java\n\n\nA: You can try this: Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/tomcat7\n\nWhen the file opens, uncomment the line that sets the JAVA_HOME variable.\n\nSave and restart tomcat7 server.\n\nA: Open terminal\necho $JAVA_HOME\n\nCopy the result. Then\nsudo -H gedit /etc/default/tomcat7\n\nReplace #JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/openjdk-6-jdk with the output you copied from $JAVA_HOME.\n\nA: Just add following line in /etc/default/tomcat7 at where JAVA_HOME variable is defined\nJAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle\n\nthen run command\nsudo service tomcat7 restart\n\n\nA: Adding to the answer of Mitch (the accepted answer above), check your /usr/lib/jvm/ directory. Usually, java is installed there itself.\nYou might have oracle java installed or you might have a latest version of java installed. Just checkout the directories at /usr/lib/jvm/ and add the one your java is in.\nFor me, it was:\n/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle\n\nSo, replace \n#JAVA_HOME=/some/directory\n\nwith\n#JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle\n\ndid the job for me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 - Unable to change brightness [ATI HD xxxx - Toshiba Satellite L510 19e] i can't change my brighness.

I realize that, this was a mistake. I have tried repartitioning using various tools, So that I can run Windows alongside Ubuntu, using my copy of Windows from another PC, but it has all become too complex. \nI love Ubuntu, wish I could keep it on its own, but I am tired of trying because, I need Windows for work related things. In particular, I have to instal my \"Wacom intuos graphics tablet\" with a serial port, but this appears too technical to me to achieve that in Ubuntu.\nI think I now have to first remove Ubuntu, reinstall Windows and then, reinstall Ubuntu by partitioning it properly, as I was advised to begin with.\nI would appreciate any answers very much, but I need answers in plain English unfortunately, because I do not understand much of the abbreviations used in Ubuntu forums.\nI should add that my treasured Ubuntu system is on an HPMini netbook, so it all has to be done with USB's. which does complicate things. Sorri :/\n\nA: This isn't really a case of uninstalling Ubuntu, just that of installing Windows.\nStick the Windows CD in, and tell it you want to use the whole disk when it asks how you want things arranged. That might involve asking it to delete the existing Ubuntu partition (it's been years since I've actually looked at the Windows installer).\nIn short: much what you did with Ubuntu, just with a different CD :)\n\nA: I'd just put in the Windows install CD, partition to your liking, install Windows on one partition and then Ubuntu on the other. You don't really need to uninstall Ubuntu first.\n\nA: Windows will not see the drive while it is formatted as EXT4 for ubuntu. You can use Gparted Live or boot the Live Ubuntu install disc and use Disc Utility to format and partition the drive. Format the first partition as NTFS for installing windows on, and the other partition as EXT4 for Ubuntu /root.\nYou may also want to create separate /home and swap partitions for Ubuntu.\nOnce the drive is partitioned & formatted you can install windows & then Ubuntu. \n\nA: Put your Windows installation disc in the CD/DVD drive and reboot. Install Windows in a partition which you think more suitable. If you are using Windows XP, It will display Linux partition with \"Unknown\" label, with incorrect total size (0 bytes may be). That partition is the one, which contains Ubuntu. Delete that partition when you are on repartitioning stage of Windows XP installation. Then install Windows as usual.\nAfter you finished installing Windows, You can install Ubuntu alongside Windows by following any of the tutorial available on the Internet.\n\nHere is some good links for Windows XP installation\n\n*\n\n*Windows XP installation in netbook via USB\nHere are some links for help with Ubuntu installation:\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu (I recommend this)\n\n*Ubuntu installation procedure from Ubuntu site\n\n*Detailed instruction for installing Ubuntu in Ubuntu wiki\n\nA: Without going too much technical - most of the actual technical are already documented perfectly in the site - you need to follow this steps if you do no want to remove Ubuntu to install a dual Windows + Ubuntu system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the Ubuntu LiveCD\n\n*Choose to test Ubuntu so you have access to a desktop, run gparted from the dash\n\n*Since you have 1 big partition for Ubuntu you will ask gparted to shrink it leaving enough space to install Windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*gparted will shrink the Ext4 partition from Ubuntu and leave some disk space free and empty\n\n*There should be no issues there, but please make a backup of important data before doing so\n\n\n*Reboot your system and insert the Windows installation CD. Windows will ask you what to do, tell it to install and it should show you the free area of your disk and the installation destination. Depending on the version of Windows it won't even see the other partition from Ubuntu, or will not be able to identify it correctly\n\n*Let the installation run and install Windows on that space, once it is done it will install the Windows boot loader in to the MBR from the disk. That will leave your Ubuntu data intact but the Windows boot loader will only allow you to boot to Windows\n\n*When the installation from Windows is done boot again from the Ubuntu LiveCD and use Boot Repair to replace the Windows boot manager with GRUB. GRUB will allow you to either boot Ubuntu or Windows.\n\n\nHere are a couple of links that will help you with the technical side of your question:\nResize a partition to create free space for antoher OS\n\n\n*\n\n*how do i shrink and divide the ubuntu partition after installing it alongside windows XP?\nRepair the boot from a system to allow multi booting\n\n\n*\n\n*Can't boot XP after Ubuntu Installation, how to fix?\n", "Q: Can't add page in a notebook I am having some trouble adding a page to a Notebook widget.

Where do I look for them? \n\nA: type your game name in the search of unity dash and of course there is a game section which have list of all games installed in the PC . look at the image .\n\nA: Perhaps you haven't used the Dash properly. I'm still getting the hang of Ubuntu myself so I can relate to your confusion.\nLook again at that picture of the Dash that was posted.  Down the bottom you have a series of icons - a house, three bars (don't ask me what they're meant to be!), a page, music notes and the last one is a video icon.  Notice that in the picture, the bars are highlighted.\nWhen you first click on the Dash icon, the house is most likely to be highlighted.  If you click the bunch of bars then you'll be shown the applications.  You'll also notice the word \"Filter\" appears over at the top right with an arrow.  That arrow can be used to open or close the Filter options.\nFilter by clicking on the word Games (the box will be given a border to show it's selected) and then see if your game appears in that list.\nIf there are more games than will fit in the window, a bar appears (white in my setup but not sure if it is in the original Desktop appearance) that you can drag up and down.  Don't know if there are scroll arrows; I haven't found any. You can also navigate the window by using your arrow keys on your keyboard.\nThe software centre lets you see what's been installed and remove it if you want and also search for other programs to be installed but doesn't let you launch them from there.\n\nA: Open the Dash and start typing the name of the game you want, you should the see the search results below as you type, click the icon to launch. \n\nA: Maybe you're confusing the Unity Dash with the Ubuntu Software Center. Simultaneously press the \"Super-key\" (Windows-key) and \"A\" to bring up the Applications Dash. From there you can type the name of the game in the search field or \"Filter Results\" just to the right of the Dash Search.

What's happening is that the installer if checking for certain hardware, etc.  So, it calls a program to look for hardware to see if it's available, and sometimes when it's not, the program outputs an error message.  The installer knows this only means the hardware is not there.  \nAs for finding Wubi, well... hopefully you know it isn't run from Windows, it's an option when you cold boot or reset the system - you choose whether to run Windows or Linux, although I have never installed it this way, so I don't know any details.\nIf you really hate Windows, I'd urge you to consider the normal install of Ubuntu; it will allow you to shrink the Windows partition (or remove it), and install in a newly created partition.  It will run better, but the downside is that it's not as easy to go back to Windows-only.

Only PC1 has to different outputs for the videocard\n2) I can connect the Ubuntu PC to the second monitor using DVI cable and AGP to DVI cable.\nMy questions are:\n1) How do I set this up on the Ubuntu machine?\n2) Can I set a hot-key to quickly disable the Dual-Mode and be able to see my Windows machine again?\nThank you!\nImage: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vvj0r.png\n\nA: I'd recommend a hardware switch for your monitors, where you can switch between \"One cable to Windows, one to Ubuntu\" and \"Two cables to Ubuntu\" by pressing a button and not physically moving cables. English isn't my primary language so I'm not sure what they are called, but most computer stores should have them available, it's basically just a box with a bunch of VGA/DVI connectors and buttons for different \"modes\".\n\nA: I actually have something similar to this for my system, although I now use one as a Ubuntu desktop, and the other is a Ubuntu server - but it used to be Windows.\nWhat I did was to hook the keyboard/mouse through a USB switch.  For the video, I connected the dual-monitor system normally, using one monitor on the DVI output, and the other from the VGA output.\nI then connected the Ubuntu server to the VGA output of the one monitor using DVI, and I use the monitor's video switch to switch between the two.  So, it's possible to see one of the screens of the (formerly) Windows system (until the screensaver kicks in) while using the other monitor for Ubuntu.\nEdit:\nSomeone mentioned KVM switches.  I've had a couple of these, and found them to be cumbersome and sometimes unreliable.  I used them for ps2 keyboard/mouse, and when I moved to USB, instead of buying yet another one, I got a simple USB switch, and use the monitor switching for VGA/DVI.  This gives a lot more flexibility (you can actually view one screen while typing on another, which can be useful if you are copying something from one to the other).\nAlso, decent KVM switches along with all the cables, isn't that cheap, and it's messy.\n", "Q: Bridging: Losing WLAN network connection with 4addr on option - Why? Question: \nFor use with my Xen VM, I need to create a virtual network interface (vif) that is bridged to wlan0.\nIf in /etc/network/interfaces I add\nauto xenbr0\n       iface xenbr0 inet dhcp\n\nAnd then later do\n\nbrctl addif xenbr0 wlan0\n\nI get this error message.\ncan't add wlan0 to bridge xenbr0: Operation not supported\n\nI found out that Linux won't let you bridge a wireless interface in managed mode at all unless you enable the 4addr option (needed to recompile iw):\niw dev wlan0 set 4addr on\n\nAfterwards\nbrctl addif xenbr0 wlan0\n\nworks, and brctl show shows xenbr0 as bridged to wlan0.\nUnfortunately, as soon as I execute\niw dev wlan0 set 4addr on\n\nmy entire network connection is gone (no connection).\nAs soon as then I execute\niw dev wlan0 set 4addr off\n\nI reconnect and it works again.\nIf I re-execute 4addr on, it breaks again, if I execute 4addr off, it works again.\nUnfortunately, I can't just turn 4addr on, activate the bridge and then turn it back off (error: device not ready).\nDoes anybody know why I lose my connection ?\n\nA: Under certain circumstances, you could also use wlan_kabel. It uses packet sockets to directly bridge wlan*-devices with ethernet devices. However, you can only bridge one single MAC at a time with wlan_kabel. It doesn't have the drawback of being barred by access points, because only the original MAC of the wlan device is used.\nIn your case this would mean, that wlan0 could only be used by one VM and not even by the host. \nYou can get wlan_kabel here.\n\nA: Found an answer here: http://nullroute.eu.org/~grawity/journal.html#post:20110826\n\niw dev wlan0 set 4addr on\n\nHowever, with 4addr enabled, you're likely to get completely ignored by the AP: association succeeds but all data frames disappear into the ether. This could be for security reasons (because it's damn hard to spoof the source MAC address. Yeah.) In my router (running OpenRG), it's necessary to enable \"WDS\" mode for the wireless AP interface, add a WDS device restricted to my laptop's MAC address, and add it to the LAN bridge. 4addr packets now work.\nThere's another problem with this, though – the router now rejects three-address packets from the laptop, which can be rather inconvenient (having to toggle 4addr every time the WLAN network is changed). The workaround is to add, on the laptop, a second wireless interface linked to the same device, but with a different MAC address:\n# undo the earlier configuration\niw dev wlan0 set 4addr off\n\n\n# add a second interface\niw dev wlan0 interface add wds.wlan0 type managed 4addr on\nip link set dev wds.wlan0 addr $ADDR\nip link set dev wds.wlan0 up\n\nHere $ADDR must match the WDS device address configured in the router; other than that, it can be any valid MAC address. The original MAC of wlan0 then remains for \"normal\" usage.\nIt's possible to use both wlan0 and wds.wlan0 at the same time – although I've only tested associating to the same AP twice, not to different APs.\n\n", "Q: How can I repair the default GTK libraries after installing GTK 3.4 from source?

I have a machine that mounts another machine's NFS share. \nHowever the client machine boots up faster than the server, so it gets an error when trying to mount the NFS share from the server. I had a power outage over the weekend and this can be annoying when I am remote. \nI would like to ensure that the NFS share is always mounted, so that if the client detects that the share isn't there it will attempt to remount it. I think this might involve autofs and/or upstart to ensure the share stays mounted, but I don't know how to do this.\nI am mounting it via the following method in /etc/fstab:\njillybean.local:/share /share nfs rsize=32768,rw,soft,intr\n\n\nA: There are multiple things you could do:\n\n\n*\n\n*add the retry=n (with n being an integer representing minutes) to your mount options in /etc/fstab for the cases NFS is not (yet) available at boot time\n\n*make use of autofs, as you suggested (lots of How-Tos returned by this Google search)\n\n*create some simple daemon process which exits when the NFS share is not available, and mounts it when invoked with the start parameter -- so you can set it up as upstart event with respawn (i.e. automatically restart when aborted other than by service xyz stop). Combine this with above retry=n)\n\n*setup a cron job checking for some (existing) directory on the NFS share -- and run the mount command when it is not found (again, combine it with retry=n)\n\n\nA: Consider to create a bash script with the following:\n#!/bin/bash\nif ! grep -qs '/share' /proc/mounts; then\n    mount jillybean.local:/share /share\nfi\n\nGive it exe permissions.\nThen put the script in crontab, croning it to your needs. For example, if you know your machines power on 7 o'clock, you could consider to execute the script every minute from 7 to 8:\n0-15 7-8 * * * /path/tho/your/script.sh\n\n\nA: Try using a background mount.\nFrom the general nfs fstab manpage:\n\nbg / fg\nDetermines how the mount(8) command behaves if an attempt to mount an\n  export fails. The fg option causes mount(8) to exit with an error\n  status if any part of the mount request times out or fails outright.\n  This is called a \"foreground\" mount, and is the default behavior if\n  neither the fg nor bg mount option is specified.\nIf the bg option is specified, a timeout or failure causes the\n  mount(8) command to fork a child which continues to attempt to mount\n  the export. The parent immediately returns with a zero exit code. This\n  is known as a \"background\" mount.\nIf the local mount point directory is missing, the mount(8) command\n  acts as if the mount request timed out. This permits nested NFS mounts\n  specified in /etc/fstab to proceed in any order during system\n  initialization, even if some NFS servers are not yet available.\n  Alternatively these issues can be addressed using an automounter\n  (refer to automount(8) for details).\n\nWhen doing a background mount, default retry is 10000 minutes. From the same page:\n\nretry=n\nThe number of minutes that the mount(8) command retries an NFS mount\n  operation in the foreground or background before giving up. If this\n  option is not specified, the default value for foreground mounts is 2\n  minutes, and the default value for background mounts is 10000 minutes\n  (80 minutes shy of one week). If a value of zero is specified, the\n  mount(8) command exits immediately after the first failure.\n\n", "Q: fatal error: avr/io.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated How to load avr/io.h header files in the gcc compiler..I'm using 12.04 version of Ubuntu..\nWhen ever i run a AVR program this kind of error is generating \n\nfatal error: avr/io.h: No such file or directory. compilation terminated.\"\n\n\nA: try installing avr-libc and gcc-avr:\nsudo apt-get install avr-libc gcc-avr\nThen, to compile code for the AVR you need start by compiling it to an executable using: gcc-avr and then link it using avr-objcopy to create a hex file for the device:\navr-gcc -mmcu=atmegaX yourpgm.c -o yourpgm.elf\navr-objcopy -j .text -O ihex yourpgm.elf yourpgm.hex\nThen, the hex file generated is the one to be installed on the device.

Every time I want to paste or add a file to the root folder it says i'm not the owner and I don't have the privlidges of putting it there. It makes me really mad.\n\nA: *\n\n*Why would you want to copy/paste a file into /?\n\n*You as a user do not own anything owned by root.\n\n*You need to put sudo in front of what you are doing if the location you want to put it is owned by root and if you are a sudo-user (ie. at least the user you used to install Ubuntu is a sudo-user.\n\n*But 1st anwser question 1: there should be NO need to put files into /. Except for /forcecheck ;)\n\n\nLinux is a multi user system. Windows is a single user system. When more than 1 person can use a system you need this kind of security otherwise you can not store any private data on a system.\n\nA: Short answer is that Linux is a multi-user operating system, and your account is only one of the users.  You, as a single human, can have multiple accounts, but each one is separate, including root, who is a super user (but you don't want to ever run under this account except temporarily for system maintenance).  You are only the owner of your home directory.\nOne of the shortcomings of earlier Windows systems was that it mainly assumed single user, and this single user was usually the administrator.  It was possible to not run as administrator, but it was very inconvenient, and many things simply did not work; there was no easy way to temporarily become administrator.  But administrators had the authority to install viruses, and other malware.  If you can run Windows from a \"normal\" user privilege level, like on Linux, you probably would get very little in the way of malware.\nLinux gives you the ability to temporarily run a program or perform an operation as root.  Sometimes this is necessary, but should be used as little as possible.  In the old days, the admin would log on as root, do some administrative tasks, and then log off the root account.  But this had problems, in that the admin might get lazy and simply log on as root right off, or forget to log off and do damage, so modern systems have a more temporary way for normal users to obtain the elevated root privileges - using sudo.  Even though it seems like more trouble, it becomes second nature, and helps protect you from inadvertent mistakes by making you think more about the fact that you are doing something possibly destructive when you use it.\nWhen you install or run programs as root, these programs can in turn access directories that are owned by root, such as /etc for configuration files.  If you don't install them as root, they cannot do this\nSome directories are owned by root, but have privileges set such that anyone can write to it, such as /tmp.  If you look at the permissions of /tmp you will see that everyone has permission to read and write to it, although only root and certain group members can delete a file that they do not either own or have write permission to (the \"t\" instead of x for all users).\n", "Q: How to install Pear Linux's shell in Ubuntu? For people who doesn't know what Pear Linux is: \n\nPear Linux is a French Ubuntu-based desktop Linux distribution.\n  Some of its features include ease-of-use, custom user interface with a\n  Mac OS X-style dockbar, and out-of-the-box support for many popular\n  multimedia codecs.\n\nExcerpt from Distrowatch.\nWhen this Linux Distribution came out, I immediately went to the website and found out that Pear Linux is actually Mac OSX with a pear.\n\nI was going to download it and install Pear Linux as a triple-boot on my computer (Windows and Ubuntu installed).\nThen I remembered that Pear Linux is Ubuntu based.  So I thought of a better Idea of installing only the Comice OS Shell in Ubuntu(the Desktop environment of Pear Linux), so that I can select that in the login screen.\nIs that possible?\nEDIt: Found this.\n\nA: It's another Linux distribution entirely, even if it's based on Ubuntu you have no idea what they've changed and what's different from the Ubuntu version you are running now. The way I see it, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try and find a theme that emulates that screenshot.

If their only contribution is changing the theme, I'd be suspicious to begin with as that doesn't seem very serious.\nI'd highly recommend modding your current Ubuntu variant and stay away from Pear Linux, but if you want to try it you should try it as a clean install (or in a VM).\n", "Q: Bastion main menu invisible I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.\nWhen I try to play Bastion, I ran into a problem.

I've just made myself a persistent LiveUSB, running Ubuntu 12.04, and I've immediately found a problem - It logs you in automatically as root, and I don't need this since I'm going to keep files and private stuff on it.\nMy Question: How can I disable automatic login on a LiveUSB?\n\nA: In the live Ubuntu 12.04 there is 1 graphical and 6 console automatic logins.\nTo disable the graphical login, use a text editor like GEDIT sudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\nChange the line:\nautologin-user=ubuntu\n\nto\nautologin-user=\n\nand append the following to make the login greeter show up:\ngreeter-show-manual-login=true\n\nThis is how you can disable the 6 console logins:\nThere are 6 files that specify the automatic logins.

Match the tty number to the number in the file name. For example, for file /etc/init/custom-tty1.conf, replace\nexec /bin/login -f ubuntu </dev/tty1 > /dev/tty1 2>&1\n\nwith\nexec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1\n\n\nA: I just discovered that an Ubuntu live USB creates a user named Ubuntu with an id of 999, and a user named root with an id of 0.  The assumption that the user is root is almost correct.  It appears as if the user Ubuntu is granted super user privileges.\nThe steps required to remove this user is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Control+Alt+Fx where x is any number from 1-5.  This will give you a terminal you can work with.  It will already be logged in as Ubuntu.\n\n*Type sudo passwd root.  This will prompt you for a root password.  Anything you enter here will become the root password.  Enter the same password twice.\n\n*Login as root by typing su, press Enter and then entering the password from step 2.\n\n*Make the changes noted in the answer above.\nNote:  You won't need to enter sudo in front of the commands since you are root!\nPress Alt+F7 to get back to the graphical interface.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the gear/cogwheel in the upper left corner of the screen, select 'system settings -> user accounts'\n\n*Create at least 1 administrative user.  Set automatic login to [off] (if it's not set already) You may need to click on the lock in the upper left of this window.\n\n*After making changes, Reboot the system by clicking the gear and selecting shut down. Select Reboot at the next screen.\n\n*When the Ubuntu user autologs into the graphic screen select the gear at the top, then select log out.\n\n*Press Control+Alt+Fx again (1-5). You should be prompted to log in.\n\n*Log in as root with the root password you entered at step 2.\n\n*Type deluser --force ubuntu ubuntu then press Enter.\n\n*Press Alt+F7 to return to the graphic interface.\n\n*Shut down and restart the system and all should be well. Your administrative user name is automatically entered into the sudo users table so you can use sudo to execute system commands.  Don't use the root user for normal work.  It just complicates system recovery efforts.\nNow, if only I could figure out how to remove the Try or Install window my usb stick would be perfect.\n\nA: What do you mean \"it logs you in automatically as root\"? I was under the impression that the root account is disabled in all flavors of Ubuntu, which means you need to go through sudo for running commands as root.\nI'd suggest the following: boot your live USB and create a new user with a password. Now reboot/log out. Hopefully this user is the only available user, and you need a password to login with this user. If not, maybe there's a guest account there as well, so you just need to disable that then. When you've come this far, you just need to encrypt your home folder, and then you're good to go. Remember to use a strong password!\nedit There's also the possibility to encrypt entire partitions during the Ubuntu install.

Can I backup only sda6(149.04GB) without losing any data? That is to say, will I be able to restore my ubuntu using only sda6 and later add the needed swap?\nEdit: Made it readable.\n\nA: Yes swap holds no persistant data so as long as your Ubuntu machine is shutdown the swap can be safely wiped or even removed.  So I you back up just the ext4, you can restore it later without the swap.\n\nA: As long as you have some free space on your ubuntu partition and wish to make a backup of the extended partition, including your swap (I don't know why, but maybe because of UUIDs and stuff), you could try FSArchiver.  It's recommended on the GParted page and can apparently clone partitions to smaller ones as long as the data can fit on said disk.\nIf FSArchiver doesn't work for you, you could always try shrinking a gigabyte or so with GParted, which shouldn't be too hard.  You might have to leave that space unallocated though, because there wouldn't be an easy place to put it (expanding partitions from the front is a risky business).\nIn any case, try backing up sda5 and sda6 separately instead of all of sda2 at once.  You might find it easier to manage, as you would only ever need one swap backup if any!\n", "Q: Use intel chip on systems with two graphics chips I have a computer with two graphics chips.  For reference, one is the Nvidia GTX 670, and the other is the integrated graphics on the Intel 3770k.\nWhen I pull out the NVidia card, Ubuntu uses the Intel Graphics chip just fine.  However, when I put in the card, it seems to insist on using the NVidia one.  Even with the closed source drivers though, the Intel chip works significantly better for general desktop usage.  So is there any way I can have ubuntu use the Intel chip rather than the NVidia one even when the nvidia card is plugged in?  (Also, if it's possible, although not really necessary I would also like to be able to have it switch to the nvidia card when requested).\n(If you are wondering why I bought the card when I'm not planning on using it, I do use it on windows, and ideally I would like to use it for scientific computing/visualization).\n\nA: Have you looked in to Bumblebee?

For some strange reason, additional timezones cannot be added to the clock using the date-time indicator in Gnome Classic (Ubuntu 12.04). I used Unity before I switched to Gnome Classic, and it was possible to add more timezones. Even in Gnome Classic I can see the other timezones in the menu of the date-time indicator which I added when I was still using Unity. When I go to System Settings > Date and Time, there is no option for adding other timezones. How can I set additional timezones in Gnome Classic?\n\nA: background\nThe unity-indicator as you may have gathered does not have the same capabilities as Unity.  The developers have patched the gnome-libraries to give this integration.  However - by design - they have left the Gnome-Shell & Gnome-Classic desktops as vanilla as possible.  This is by expression wish by the gnome-developers.\nThus you will need a slightly more inventive solution - this answer will give you one such suggestion.\nuse the clock applet\n\nTemporarily add the clock applet to the panel.\nFind your location by clicking edit in the applet\nNext look carefully at the locations:\n\nThe value you are interested in is timezone city\nIn this example:\nAmerica/Port_of_Spain Piarco\nEurope/Rome Verona\n\nNext fire up dconf-editor\ndconf-tools \nLook at the locations field as shown and add your new location(s) - each entry is in the format ,'timezone city' i.e. separate entries with commas\n\nYou then will automatically update your date-time indicator.  You can finish off by deleting the clock applet.\n\n\nA: If the \"Choose locations\" is missing from the Date and Time control but it does work, you should file a bug about it:\nubuntu-bug gnome-session-fallback\n\nYou can actually edit it manually through dconf-editor:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\ndconf-editor\n\nSelect com > canonical > indicator > datetime\nLook at the locations value.\n['UTC UTC', 'Asia/Nicosia Nicosia']\n\nPurely guessing, I think the first (e.g. Asia/Nicosia) is the time zone name and the second (e.g. Nicosia) is the name that appears in the indicator menu (tray icon).\nYou can find the list of time zones here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\n", "Q: How do I enable DNS caching in the NetworkManager-controlled dnsmasq? Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 uses dnsmasq to perform DNS lookups, but it is not configured to cache these results. (I have checked this by using dig to resolve names and I do not see a large improvement in the response time after the first lookup.) How do I configure the NetworkManager-controlled dnsmasq to cache the results of DNS lookups?\n\nA: I was able to enable DNS caching in Linux Mint 13 (based on Ubuntu 12.04) using the method described in the first answer.  I created a file /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/cachedns containing the line cache-size=100, then restarted network-manager.  Even though dnsmasq is executed by network-manager with a hard-coded --cache-size=0 on its command line, setting the cache-size in a config file overrides that value.  You can verify that it works by doing this:\nsudo killall -USR1 dnsmasq\ntail /var/log/syslog\n\nYou should see a line that looks like this in the syslog, showing the cache size:\ndnsmasq[17808]: cache size 100, 0/2 cache insertions re-used unexpired cache entries.\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.10 you can enable the cache of the NetworkManager-controlled dnsmasq instance by putting the line\ncache-size=1000\n\n(with your preferred number of names instead of 1000) in a new file in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/.  To activate this change you must then do\nsudo stop network-manager\nsudo killall dnsmasq\nsudo start network-manager\n\nor reboot.\n\nA: I didn't want to upgrade from 12.04, but still wanted dnsmasq managed by NetworkManager with caching enabled, but as the other answer said, --cache-size=0 is hard-coded and can't be changed with configuration.\nSo what I ended up doing was the following, as root:\nmv /usr/sbin/dnsmasq /usr/sbin/dnsmasq.real\n\nand then creating a new file, /usr/sbin/dnsmasq with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\nargs=$(echo \"$@\" | sed 's/--cache-size=0/--cache-size=1000/')\n/usr/sbin/dnsmasq.real $args\n\nmake sure you chmod +x /usr/sbin/dnsmasq, and change the cache-size from 1000 to whatever you want, enjoy your LTS release with a DNS cache!\n\nA: in 12.04 dnsmasq is started by NetworkManager with hard-coded (i.e. not configurable) parameter --cache-size=0.\nmanpages for dnsmasq says setting cache-size to zero disables caching. If you want to enable caching, you will probably have to disable the dnsmasq-plugin for NetworkManager to prevent NetworkManager from starting dnsmasq and start your own instance of dnsmasq with cache-size greater then zero.\nhere you can read how to disable dnsmasq-plugin for NetworkManager: https://askubuntu.com/a/131422/71057\n\nA: To re-enable the cache (with a NetworkManager version that has the /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d directory), it is actually sufficient to drop a file in that directory with content \"cache-size=X\" (with X being 150 for the default dnsmasq would have). The files in there override the hard-coded parameters given on the commandline.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04, I had to edit /etc/default/dnsmasq and set ENABLED=1\nI also put cache-size=1000 there and in all the other dnsmasq config files that I found.\n", "Q: Monitor Internet Usage on Ubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can you monitor internet download usage? \n\nAny idea how one would monitor internet usage on a laptop to find out if any unauthorised program is making internet connections?\n\nA: Use nethogs :) \nInstall it by typing sudo apt-get install nethogs. \nTo start the app type: \nsudo nethogs [network interface name e.g. eth0, eth1 or ppp0 etc.]  To find this name use the command ifconfig and check which of the interfaces are associated with valid ip address..\n", "Q: Using .add() on the same widget more than once I asked this question on Reddit and was directed here.\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/vhadl/quickly_dynamic_ui/\nUnfortunately I am having the same issue and the problems seems that you can only use .add() on a widget once. So here is my code,\nself.ui.labels = []\nfor titles in entries:\n    label = Gtk.Label()\n    self.ui.labels.append(label)         \n    self.ui.viewport1.add(self.ui.labels[-1])\nself.ui.paned1.show_all()\n\nNow, for fun I decided \"What would happen if I just manually did...\"\nself.ui.viewport1.add(Gtk.Label())\nself.ui.viewport1.add(Gtk.Button())\nself.ui.viewport1.add(Gtk.Entry())\n\nFor my first code snippet I get this error,\nGtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_viewport_add: assertion gtk_bin_get_child (bin) == NULL' failed\nThe error happens an unknown amount of times because the list entries can vary in length, but for my second code snippet it happens exactly twice. This means that when I viewport1.add() it works the first time, but all adds after that receive the error above.\nSo my question, is there a way in python to use .add() on the same widget more than once?\n\nA: Gtk has different types of containers. Right now, you are working with a GtkBin container, which is a type of container that only supports a single child. You need a container that supports more than one child. To do that, just create a container of your choice and add it to the viewport (like an ordinary widget). There are a few choices here, and they are all listed in the Gtk documentation on containers.\nOne way to do this is with a GtkBox:\nself.ui.labels = []\nfor titles in entries:\n    label = Gtk.Label()\n    self.ui.labels.append(label)         \n    self.ui.viewport1.add(self.ui.labels[-1])\nself.ui.paned1.show_all()\n\n# First, we need to create a box to hold all our widgets\nbox = Gtk.Box()\nbox.set_orientation(Gtk.Orientation.VERTICAL)\n\n# Now add our widgets to the box, one by one, from the bottom\nbox.add(Gtk.Label())\nbox.add(Gtk.Button())\nbox.add(Gtk.Entry())\n\n# We need to add the box to the viewport\nself.ui.viewport.add(box)\n\nbox.show_all()\n\nOnce you get the hang of it, you might want to play with some other functionality. Instead of blindly adding widgets to the box, the pack_start and pack_end functions for GtkBox give you control for each widget you add. You can set whether a child is given all the available space, and how much space to put around it. For some cases you might be interested in GtkGrid, which is a more powerful container that supports multiple rows and columns.\n", "Q: Skype not working I downloaded the latest upgrade in May 2012, and as always, I experienced some issues.

I solved it by resetting pulseaudio user configuration as explained here.\nYou have to run the following lines in terminal\nrm -r ~/.pulse*; pulseaudio -k\n\nand then logout and log back in.\n\nA: If you are referring to the problem that, You cannot select sound profile from the sound settings menu, then you can try the following method. I provided the answer in some questions. It works for me, so can also work for you.\n\nSolution 1:\n(It worked for me with Only S/PDIF profile, Sound from both headphone and speaker and not being able to switch profile)\n\n*\n\n*Add this ppa by the command\n sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/alsa-daily\n\n\n\n*Update packages list by\n sudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n*Then install \"alsa-hda-dkms\" package:\n sudo apt-get install alsa-hda-dkms\n\nReboot, And See the result!\n\nSolution 2\n\n*\n\n*Go to Realtek official site, accept the disclaimer, then download the audio driver for linux/unix. You need to select version 3 for Kernel 3 or later.\n\n\n*Setup necessary tools to compile this driver.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential gcc make\n\n\n*Extract the downloaded file, run sudo ./install file from a terminal after going to the extracted folder to compile the driver.\n\n\n*Read the Readme.txt file for more information.\nI had a problem with Sound settings in Ubuntu 12.04 (not being able to switch profile). It fixed now.\n\nA: I have had this problem with 12.10 and looked all over.  I finally found my answer here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/864735\nI modified /etc/default/grub, rebooted and voila!\nHope this helps.\n\nA: In my case (Dell Latitude E4310 laptop) the problem was the following line in /etc/pulse/client.conf:\nautospawn = no\n\nI commented this out, and then ran\npulseaudio -k\n\nand\npulseaudio\n\nand then the sound icon in the taskbar came back to life, and the volume up/down/mute buttons started working.\n\nA: Install pulseaudio-module-udev\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-udev\n\n", "Q: In Glade, how do I set a widget size (i.e. minimum and maximum)? I want to set the size of one of the widgets of an app developed with Quickly and Glade.\nI know how to set a minimum size in the 'Common' tab, with 'Width request' and 'Height request'. But I would like to set also the maximum size. How do I do that ?\nThat way, I will also have the possibility to set the size entirely, if I force minimum = maximum.\n\nA: I don't believe you can set a maximum size as size requirements adjust due to things such as translations and screen resolutions. If you need a widget to not get beyond a certain size, size it in proportion to the other widgets.\n", "Q: How can I relocate the default quickly directory?

Could someone please help me with this as it can render my PC unnavigatable unless I'm sitting right up against it, and even then I struggle. I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n\nA: I believe gnome-tweak-tool should have a resolution for this. You can change the font sizes throughout your desktop. It will create an application called 'Advanced Settings'. To get gnome-tweak-tool open up your terminal and:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ricotz/testing\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nWhen it is finished open up gnome-tweak-tool and go to Fonts.

I am almost ready to complete my app, but I am unclear on the sequence of packing a completed app, and getting it uploaded so users of the software center can find it for installing.\nDoes the signing of the files with a GPG key have to be done to just the debian/ directory, or do I have to use a quickly command to upload it and it is then signed on Launchpad?\n\nA: The first step is to ensure you have your GPG installed on Launchpad. Details of how to set this up are at https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/ImportingYourPGPKey - this only takes a few minutes to set up.\nWhen you have your GPG in place you are in a position to put a package in a PPA on Launchpad.\nIf you just want to generate a package and install it on your computer, you can do this by running quickly package (presuming you are using Quickly).\nIf you are not running Quickly just run dpkg-buildpackage when you have configured your packaging (Quickly automates this).\nTo publish to the PPA run quickly release (this will require that your GPG key is already set up).\n", "Q: Cannot boot Kubuntu after CD install I have installed Kubuntu 11.04 and had to install it several times before it would boot up after the CD install.

I'd like to use the samba to share out the hard drive.\n\nA: This sounds like the basic task of mounting drives in etc/fstab, which is fairly simple.  This is where your other partitions are mounted, such as swap, /home if separate, etc.\nThis file is a simple text file that you edit using something like gedit or vim, such as sudo gedit /etc/fstab.  \nBy the way, you don't really mount drives, you mount partitions (actually filesystems, but thinking of it as partitions is usually fine).  Do you know how to use the mount command?\n\nA: That should happen automatically. If it doesn't, just run sudo restart smbd to restart the samba daemon (after the drive is mounted).\n", "Q: Boot to safe mode to reset password not available Ubuntu 11.10\nPassword to root was lost\nTrying to reboot in safe mode to reset\nHolding shift (left or right)\nEsc\nF1\nNone are effective during bootup.\nNo BIOS setting appear applicable.\nAll forums seem to indicate left shift should work. Any alternatives to boot into recovery/safe mode?

I've asked a question on stackoverflow, and it seems that the issue I am having is caused by signals, not by the scope of variables, as I originally thought. The problem I am having is that when TextBox emits a signal through activate the whole code works without a glitch. But when I change the signal to insert-at-click it returns NameErrors in every non-TextBox-linked function. Now, It is highly possible I am doing something completely wrong here, but is it at least probable that signals could affect global variable assignments?\nThe code in its current form giving me NameErrors:\ndef on_servername_insertatcursor(self, widget):\nglobal output  \noutput = StringIO.StringIO()         \nservername = widget.get_text()\noutput.write(\"USHARE_NAME=\"+servername+'\\n')\n\ndef on_netif_changed(self, widget):\nnetif = widget.get_active_text()\nglobal output\noutput.write(\"USHARE_IFACE=\"+netif+'\\n')\n\ndef on_port_insertatcursor(self, widget):\nglobal output\nport = widget.get_text()\noutput.write(\"USHARE_PORT=\"+port+'\\n')\n\ndef on_telprt_insertatcursor(self, widget):\nglobal output\ntelprt = widget.get_text()\noutput.write(\"USHARE_TELNET_PORT=\"+telprt+'\\n')\n\ndef on_dirs_insertatcursor(self, widget):\nglobal output\ndirs = widget.get_text()\noutput.write(\"USHARE_DIR=\"+dirs+'\\n')\n\ndef on_iconv_toggled(self, widget):\nglobal output\niconv = widget.get_active()\nif iconv == True:\n    output.write(\"USHARE_OVERRIDE_ICONV_ERR=\"+\"True\"+'\\n')\nelse:\n    output.write(\"USHARE_OVERRIDE_ICONV_ERR=\"+\"False\"+'\\n')\n\ndef on_webif_toggled(self, widget):\nglobal output\nwebif = widget.get_active()\nif webif == True:\n    output.write(\"USHARE_ENABLE_WEB=\"+\"yes\"+'\\n')\nelse:\n    output.write(\"USHARE_ENABLE_WEB=\"+\"no\"+'\\n')\n\ndef on_telif_toggled(self, widget):\nglobal output\ntelif = widget.get_active()\nif telif == True:\n    output.write(\"USHARE_ENABLE_TELNET=\"+\"yes\"+'\\n')\nelse:\n    output.write(\"USHARE_ENABLE_TELNET=\"+\"no\"+'\\n')\n\ndef on_xbox_toggled(self, widget):\nglobal output\nxbox = widget.get_active()\nif xbox == True:\n    output.write(\"USHARE_ENABLE_XBOX=\"+\"yes\"+'\\n')\nelse:\n    output.write(\"USHARE_ENABLE_XBOX=\"+\"no\"+'\\n')\n\ndef on_dlna_toggled(self, widget):\nglobal output\ndlna = widget.get_active()\nif dlna == True:\n    output.write(\"USHARE_ENABLE_DLNA=\"+\"yes\"+'\\n')\nelse:\n    output.write(\"USHARE_ENABLE_DLNA=\"+\"no\"+'\\n')\n\ndef on_commit_clicked(self, widget):\ncommit = output.getvalue()\nlogfile = open('/home/boywithaxe/Desktop/ushare.conf','w')\nlogfile.write(commit)\n\ndef on_endprogram_clicked(self, widget):\nsys.exit(0)\n\n\nA: You're misunderstanding the meaning of the global statement in Python. Here's what the Python documentation says:\n\nThe global statement ... means that the listed identifiers are to be\n  interpreted as globals. It would be impossible to assign to a global\n  variable without global, although free variables may refer to globals\n  without being declared global.\n\nSo, basically, you only need to use global blah when you need to assign to a global variable called blah. The variable, however, should already exist in the global scope. If you're just accessing a global variable or its methods (as apposied to assigning to it), you don't need to declare it as global.\nSo what you need is something like\noutput = None\n\ndef on_servername_insertatcursor(self, widget):\n    global output  \n    output = StringIO.StringIO()         \n    servername = widget.get_text()\n    output.write(\"USHARE_NAME=\"+servername+'\\n')\n\ndef on_netif_changed(self, widget):\n    netif = widget.get_active_text()\n    output.write(\"USHARE_IFACE=\"+netif+'\\n')\n\n...\n\nHowever, the whole approach with using a global variable and making the whole thing dependent on the order of function calls (on_servername_insertatcursor MUST be called first, otherwise the other functions will fail) is not a good coding practice.\nUPDATE: Also, it occurred to me that the functions you're showing are in fact methods of a class, is that right? In this case, you can make output a member of the class and access it as self.output:\nclass MyApp(gtk.Window):\n\n    output = None\n\n    def __init__(...):\n        ...\n        self.output = StringIO.StringIO()\n\n    def on_servername_insertatcursor(self, widget):    \n        servername = widget.get_text()\n        self.output.write(\"USHARE_NAME=\"+servername+'\\n')\n\n    def on_netif_changed(self, widget):\n        netif = widget.get_active_text()\n        self.output.write(\"USHARE_IFACE=\"+netif+'\\n')\n\nStill, the output of your app is dependent on the order user clicks the buttons, which is not cool. For example if user clicks the \"dlna\" checkbox twice, there will be 2 lines in the config, which I presume is not what you want.\n", "Q: Will Contacts ever sync with Thunderbird in Ubuntu 12.04? Status message says there is yet more disruption to this service.\nAre Ubuntu actually serious about this service, or should we all just look for another provider?\n\nA: Alternatively you can get (download) a .vcf file for the contacts (its called exporting contacts in most mailing services) from your contacts, open contacts, go to the menue bar, under tools you will find import. NOTE: this option may only load emails and names, leaving out phone or mobile numbers.\n\nA: I am using Thunderbird (with Lightning calendar) and Zindus add-in for syncing contacts via Google.

Do I need 32GB swap? \n\nSince the late 90s I've always understood that it is best practice to allocate twice the amount of physical RAM as swap space.  \nI just received my new laptop in the mail and it came with 6GB of RAM.  In a separate order I had 16GB of RAM to replace the preinstalled.  I didn't have the right torx driver to get to the RAM in this machine, so I installed Ubuntu and manually set a 16GB partition for swap.  32GB seemed a tad excessive...  \nDid I make the right choice?  Would my machine perform better if there was no SWAP at all?\n\nA: The main reason you need swap space is for hibernation; I've been told that if you hibernate, it needs to save everything to swap.  I'm not sure if it always save the entire memory or just what's in use, but if you want to hibernate, you probably should have a bit more than the maximum RAM.  Other than that, I never see swap used at all on my 4GB system, although it might get used if you do complex image editing with lots of layers and big images.\nDepending on how big a drive you have, you can be \"generous\", and it's pretty easy to change later if needed.  But I think 16GB is more than enough; I probably would have chosen 8 - 10.\nAccording to the Ubuntu Swap FAQ, you should always have some swap space.  It seems like it may be dated a bit, since it considers 2GB with a 100GB HD to be a high amount of RAM and a big drive, but it says swap should equal RAM in that case.  My guess is that with larger amounts of RAM, you may be able to go lower, but it depends on what programs you use and how many, how long you system stays up, and whether you hibernate.\n", "Q: Bluetooth settings shows the error \"No bluetooth adaptor found\" I'm gettng a \"No bluetooth adaptor\" found message under blutooth settings when i have an adaptor and it's on.\nWhy? \nI have a sony vaio cr343nb.\n\nA: I found  the answer, well not exactly but it worked.I had to enable the bluetooth that i had disabled on my windows partition and then boot from my Ubuntu pen drive and it recognized the bluetooth device and worked perfectly. thanks\n\nA: The Linux kernel was not made to work with proprietary drivers, so it's possible that if you're computer was manufactured with windows/mac in mind, there will be components that don't work.

It uses psychoacoustics to do this, i.e. it manipulates the sound so that the human brain is tricked into making it sound \"better\".\nNote that the Waves drivers are Windows-only, so you won't get these effects in Ubuntu.

The most common ones are:\n\n*\n\n*Those dependencies are now also required/recommended by some other package(s) which are still installed on your system.\n\n*The original package was a meta-package, i.e. a shortcut to install multiple packages in one swift stroke. Removing a metapackage only removes the shortcut itself, not all the packages it installed. Common examples are the various umbrella desktop packages, eg ubuntu-desktop.\n\nTo remove, use apt-cache depends package-name to get its dependencies, and feed those to apt-get remove. Double check the list shown to make sure you don't lose anything important!\nYou can do this in one step with the following command (again, don't press Y unless you've read the list!):\n\nsudo apt-get remove `apt-cache depends dansguardian | grep Dep | cut -d: -f2 | tr '\\n' ' '`\n\n\nA: As izx said, in his general answer, the first point, can be the cause of this sort of things.\n\nThose dependencies are now also required/recommended by some other package(s) which are still installed on your system.\n\nThis is the most probable and valid reason for this kind of situation,But I am thinking that, the other packages named with clamav clamav-base clamav-freshclam libclamav6 libtommath0 most likely only associated with their mother package clamav. So, the first point, may not be the case in this particular situation.\nThe most likely cause of this problem, which seems to be the cause is, after installing the dansguardian package, you later installed all it's dependency packages by doing this kind of command below:\nsudo apt-get install clamav clamav-base clamav-freshclam dansguardian libclamav6 libtommath0\n\nIf this is indeed the case, you can't uninstalled them by removing their mother package dansguardian. since in APT's language, they are installed \"manually\" as you explicitly installed these packages by feeding their name to the apt-get command, so must also uninstall them with explicitly stating their package name\nYou can check this, if it is the case by viewing /var/log/apt/history.log files.\nTo remove:\nYou must remove the installed packages by explicitly naming their name.So, in your specific situation it is\nsudo apt-get purge clamav clamav-base clamav-freshclam dansguardian libclamav6 libtommath0\n\nTo see the dependent packages\nYou can find all the dependent packages with the below command:\napt-cache depends -i dansguardian | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr '\\n' ' '.\n\nNote that, dansguardian depends on package libc6. while that package is very very essential one in your system. So, you can't remove all the dependency of dansguardian by generating their dependency package list with apt-cache command, hence it is not recommended. (actually, it is highly recommended to avoid doing that, unless you are happy with a broken system)\n", "Q: Switching OS from Ubuntu to XP? I originally had Windows XP on my computer. Then I decided to download Ubuntu 12.04. I didn't use any CDs or USBs or anything. I did not know that in doing so I wouldn't have access to any of my files. If I switch back to XP will my files still be there? If so, how do I switch back?\n\nA: Sounds like that you are using Wubi since you said that you didn't use any USB drives and CD's.\nTo access your C Drive in Wubi, click the Folder icon on the launcher, then click File \nSystem on the sidebar.  Go to /host and you will see your C drive on Windows XP. \nTo uninstall Ubuntu, go to the Control Panel and uninstall \"Ubuntu\".\nYour files will still be there as usual.  But not those files that you created in Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you mean you used wubi, then yes, your files should still be there. If you used a live cd/dvd/usb, It's possible you could have deleted XP. Does it show XP at the boot menu? If so, navigating to it and pressing enter should boot your old OS. If XP doesn't appear in the boot menu, then most likely you're out of luck.\n\nA: \nI didn't use any CDs or USBs or anything.\n\nI guess you mean you use wubi installation method. i.e Install Ubuntu inside Windows as a seperate application. In this case, Windows should not be deleted. You can easily access Windows at boot menu. Boot menu is a menu which provide you to choose from existing OS to boot.\n\nIf I switch back to XP will my files still be there?\n\nIf you are referring to boot into the XP, yes, you will find your files there. But if you are referring to Installing XP again by removing Ubuntu installation, which probably be installed inside the Windows. You will not get your file, if you install XP again in the same partition.\nYou can uninstall Ubuntu (if you used wubi method) just as like as you uninstall any other program in XP.

Should I share the Public folder contained within my Home Folder byt right clicking on it and using the share option?\nThanks!\nNoob\n\nA: Short answer: yes, that is a good way to share the folder.  It will prompt you for permissions much like windows - whether to allow others read-only access, or write access.\nLinux permissions apply to the owner, the group, and/or the general public.  Generally, the group permissions are not that important for normal use.  Each of these has 3 permissions that are used in combination: read, write, execute.  So if you are owner, you might have read/write permissions, but others might have only read, or even none.\n", "Q: How do I set the root password so I can use su instead of sudo? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to know my root password?\n\nI'd like to define a password for root so that I can use su directly, without having to prepend it with sudo.

One thing that keeps nagging me is this. I have two partitions for file storage, besides the root partition. Ubuntu mounts any partition I open and shows it in desktop. I don't see Windows mounting my partitions when I open one, but that may be just under the hood. It might be a simple thing but I want to know. Sorry if I'm sounding stupid.\n\nA: I am going to add the answer as it is in Official wiki\n\nData on a computer, as you may know, is stored in binary as a series of 1s and 0s. The way these are stored on a device and their structure is called the \"filesystem\". In Linux devices are referenced in /dev. Data is not actually stored on a device so you cannot access this data by going into /dev, this is because it is stored inside the filesystem on the device so you need to access these filesystems somehow. Accessing such filesystems is called \"mounting\" them, and in Linux (like any UNIX system) you can mount filesystems into any directory, that is, make the files stored in that filesystem accessible when you go into a certain directory. These directories are called the \"mount points\" of a filesystem. In other systems this is done differently. For example in Windows there is no distinction made between a device and the filesystem on it, and the user is restricted to mounting a device's filesystem in a top-level volume which is automatically assigned a letter such as C:, D:, etc. and the files inside these filesystems are accessed inside each volume's root such as \"C:\\\", \"D:\\\", \"E:\\\", etc. (remember, Windows uses back slashes instead of the more common forward slashes you find in Linux)\n\n\nA: I would suggest using Ubuntu Tweak.

I am posting the smart data here anyways.\nsmartctl 5.41 2011-06-09 r3365 [i686-linux-3.1.6-pmagic] (local build)\nCopyright (C) 2002-11 by Bruce Allen, http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net\n\n=== START OF INFORMATION SECTION ===\nModel Family:     Seagate Barracuda 7200.10\nDevice Model:     ST3160815AS\nSerial Number:    5RX4PFTR\nFirmware Version: 3.CHF\nUser Capacity:    160,041,885,696 bytes [160 GB]\nSector Size:      512 bytes logical/physical\nDevice is:        In smartctl database [for details use: -P show]\nATA Version is:   7\nATA Standard is:  Exact ATA specification draft version not indicated\nLocal Time is:    Sun Jun 24 17:07:49 2012 UTC\nSMART support is: Available - device has SMART capability.\nSMART support is: Enabled\n\n=== START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION ===\nSMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED\n\nGeneral SMART Values:\nOffline data collection status:  (0x82) Offline data collection activity\n                    was completed without error.\n                    Auto Offline Data Collection: Enabled.\nSelf-test execution status:      (   0) The previous self-test routine completed\n                    without error or no self-test has ever \n                    been run.\nTotal time to complete Offline \ndata collection:        (  433) seconds.\nOffline data collection\ncapabilities:            (0x5b) SMART execute Offline immediate.\n                    Auto Offline data collection on/off support.\n                    Suspend Offline collection upon new\n                    command.\n                    Offline surface scan supported.\n                    Self-test supported.\n                    No Conveyance Self-test supported.\n                    Selective Self-test supported.\nSMART capabilities:            (0x0003) Saves SMART data before entering\n                    power-saving mode.\n                    Supports SMART auto save timer.\nError logging capability:        (0x01) Error logging supported.\n                    General Purpose Logging supported.\nShort self-test routine \nrecommended polling time:    (   2) minutes.\nExtended self-test routine\nrecommended polling time:    (  52) minutes.\nSCT capabilities:          (0x0035) SCT Status supported.\n                    SCT Feature Control supported.\n                    SCT Data Table supported.\n\nSMART Attributes Data Structure revision number: 10\nVendor Specific SMART Attributes with Thresholds:\nID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME          FLAG     VALUE WORST THRESH TYPE      UPDATED  WHEN_FAILED RAW_VALUE\n  1 Raw_Read_Error_Rate     0x000f   100   253   006    Pre-fail  Always       -       0\n  3 Spin_Up_Time            0x0002   098   096   000    Old_age   Always       -       0\n  4 Start_Stop_Count        0x0033   099   099   020    Pre-fail  Always       -       1568\n  5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0x0033   100   100   036    Pre-fail  Always       -       0\n  7 Seek_Error_Rate         0x000f   085   060   030    Pre-fail  Always       -       352177338\n  9 Power_On_Hours          0x0032   093   093   000    Old_age   Always       -       6721\n 10 Spin_Retry_Count        0x0013   100   100   097    Pre-fail  Always       -       0\n 12 Power_Cycle_Count       0x0033   099   099   020    Pre-fail  Always       -       1529\n184 End-to-End_Error        0x0033   100   253   097    Pre-fail  Always       -       0\n187 Reported_Uncorrect      0x003a   001   001   000    Old_age   Always       -       13311\n189 High_Fly_Writes         0x0022   096   096   000    Old_age   Always       -       4\n190 Airflow_Temperature_Cel 0x001a   060   050   000    Old_age   Always       -       40 (Min/Max 40/42)\n194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0000   040   050   000    Old_age   Offline      -       40 (0 15 0 0)\n195 Hardware_ECC_Recovered  0x0032   082   065   000    Old_age   Always       -       214888792\n197 Current_Pending_Sector  0x0000   100   100   000    Old_age   Offline      -       0\n198 Offline_Uncorrectable   0x0000   100   100   000    Old_age   Offline      -       0\n199 UDMA_CRC_Error_Count    0x0000   200   200   000    Old_age   Offline      -       0\n\nSMART Error Log Version: 1\nATA Error Count: 13338 (device log contains only the most recent five errors)\n    CR = Command Register [HEX]\n    FR = Features Register [HEX]\n    SC = Sector Count Register [HEX]\n    SN = Sector Number Register [HEX]\n    CL = Cylinder Low Register [HEX]\n    CH = Cylinder High Register [HEX]\n    DH = Device/Head Register [HEX]\n    DC = Device Command Register [HEX]\n    ER = Error register [HEX]\n    ST = Status register [HEX]\nPowered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as\nDDd+hh:mm:SS.sss where DD=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes,\nSS=sec, and sss=millisec.

Boot the livecd and try running this command, and be sure to type it exactly:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 of=/dev/null skip=10591896\n\nIf that gives you an IO error, then try writing to it:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=512 count=1 of=/dev/sda seek=10591896\n\nIf that works, run the first command again and see if it now works, then check the smart stats again.  Either there should be a reallocated sector, in which case, the drive remapped the bad sector to a spare one, or the write corrected the problem.  Run the long smart selftest to see if there are any more errors and repeat.  After that, use the disk utility to check the filesystem.\nIf the reallocated count is still zero, you should be good to go, if it isn't, then the drive has some damage and you may want to replace it.\n\nA: smart data seems to be ok for me. there are some errors in the log but that shouldnt leed into panic. You should try to format the hole disk. the hdd-firmware should then reallocate blocks if nessescary without user interaction.\nBtw. its absolutely nonsense that a hard drive with relocated sectors will die soon. ive hdds with relocated sectors running for over ten years now without any problems.\nAs long you dont get smart warnings that your hdd is about to die you should be safe.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Graphics Card boot issue I upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 because Gimp wouldn't install on 11.10. Said some conditions were not fulfilled. I upgraded and the graphics went for a toss.  I was told by a friend to install the OpenGL drivers available on the nVIDIA website. I downloaded it and installed it then Ubuntu would not boot properly. Ubuntu always freezes up either at the login screen or the desktop. Sometimes it just hangs when I open the terminal. I reinstalled 11.10, again because I was told 12.04 had issues.\nNow 11.10 will not load or has the same issues because of the graphic driver issues, I suppose. Now sometimes, on start up after the memory test, the screen just goes black with a blinking cursor on top. And I have no idea what to do with the Grub rescue. I am losing valuable time, unable to finish my work. I would appreciate it if someone could sort this out. Or atleast help me around with the grub rescue. How do I use that to fix the graphic issues?\nMy graphics card is a nVIDIA quadro fx 1500.\nedit \nI have not yet installed the graphic drivers. The graphics were a little messed up when I had first installed ubuntu 11.10 but got worse after I updated it to 12.04. I re-installed 11.10 but the graphics are still as messed up. SO much so that I cannot even view the desktop if it finally does log me in. \n\nA: nVIDIA Drivers usually have issues with Ubuntu, and I don't know why.  I don't recommend installing the Graphic Drivers unless you know what you are doing or other experienced users told you to do so.\nAfter you went on and reinstalled Ubuntu 11.10, does grub rescue show up before you even get to use Ubuntu 11.10?\nIf the answer is yes, read my answer to reinstall GRUB.\nIf the answer is no(that you messed up ubuntu yourself), then you would have to reinstall Ubuntu and remember not to install the Graphics card drivers.\n", "Q: Where can I get a list of SCHEMA / PATH / KEY to use with gsettings? After doing some research, I found that I can quickly set configuration options using the gsettings command in the terminal, instead of installing dconf-editor or gconf-editor or CCSM. \nBut we need the SCHEMA/PATH and KEY to set the value.\nSyntax is:  \ngsettings set SCHEMA[:PATH] KEY VALUE\n\nFor example to never auto-hide the launcher:  \ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher hide-mode 0\n\nAnd, for windows not to overlap the launcher:  \ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher use-strut true \n\nSo, where can I get a list of all the SCHEMA / PATH / KEY that can be set with gsettings?\nNo, please don't suggest the gsettings list-keys command, because I don't know the possibly hundreds of schema available. \n\nA: gsettings list-schemas gets you all the schema. You can also use gsettings list-recursively for what you want but this program will list all the values for all the keys for all schemas:\n(Lest's call the script gsettings-iterate-all)\n#!/bin/bash\n# Gnome 3 can be customised from the command line via the gsettings command\n# This script should help you to find what you're looking for by\n# listing the ranges for all keys for each schema\n\nfor schema in $(gsettings list-schemas | sort)\ndo\n    for key in $(gsettings list-keys $schema | sort)\n    do\n        value=\"$(gsettings range $schema $key | tr \"\\n\" \" \")\"\n        echo \"$schema :: $key :: $value\"\n    done\ndone\n\nExpanding on your example gsettings-iterate-all | grep com.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher  yields \ncom.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher :: edge-decayrate :: type i \ncom.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher :: edge-overcome-pressure :: type i \ncom.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher :: edge-responsiveness :: type d \ncom.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher :: edge-reveal-pressure :: type i \ncom.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher :: edge-stop-velocity :: type i \ncom.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher :: hide-mode :: type i \ncom.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher :: only-one-launcher :: type b \ncom.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher :: reveal-mode :: type i \ncom.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher :: super-key-enable :: type b \n\nYou can reroute the output to a file for easy reading.\nAnd for creative folks out there. Here is a list of possible options to gsettings that might help create other scripts.\n\nA: It's a bit late, but I just started wrestling with this privacy concern...\nIt looks like com.canonical.Unity.Lenses remote-content-search 'none' is the toggle you seek.\n", "Q: Why do I get a blue screen after interrupting upgrade to 12.04 with a power-off? I've turned off my laptop while the update manager was installing ubuntu 12.04 LTS.  Now when I try to boot into ubuntu the screen is only in blue and I can do nothing execpt to turn it off.  Is there anyway to reinstall th OS using the downloaded files?  Thanks!\n\nA: Today I had a very similar problem -- after updating the system, rebooting and logging in, only the blue screen appeared without any signs of Unity. The way I fixed it was this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Switched to tty1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1), logged in and made sure that all updates have been applied (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade).\n\n*Installed gdm by executing sudo apt-get install gdm. This automatically invoked configuration where I have selected gdm instead of lightdm. Installation of gdm lead to uninstallation of unity.\n\n*Rebooted, switched to tty1, logged in, and installed unity by executing sudo apt-get install unity and then ran sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm where I have selected lightdm this time.\n\n*Rebooted, logged in using the graphical prompt and Unity loaded as hoped for.\n\n\nHope this experience will be useful.\n\nA: Turning off a computer while updating is a very dangerous and risky task.  Do not do that unless there is a kernel panic or a power outage.\nNow the only thing you can do is to recover all your personal files using a Ubuntu LiveCD and reinstall Ubuntu.\n\nA: While upgrading the system is very vulnerable. Files needed by the system are removed and replaced. Turning of your machine while doing this can pretty much break the system. That's what happened with you. To install Ubuntu now, you'll need to create a live CD or bootable usb drive. Try getting your data off of the hard disk first. Good luck.\n\nA: If you believe to be experienced enough you can boot from a live CD and chroot into your installation's root directory and run apt-get upgrade and apt-get upgrade. This sometimes throws errors that allow you to google for a solution or downright give the commands to fix your problem.\nIf you don't know how to 'chroot' it is probably easiest to salvage your personal files and do a fresh install.\n", "Q: How do I set up a mail server on a Linode VPS? i have a linode account and trying to setup an email server where i can send and receive email from my registered domain.\ni typed this into shell:\nsudo tasksel install mail-server\nbut what is the next step? \n\nA: Running a mailserver is not a install-and-go process. Over time you'll want to deal with spam and viruses and people trying to hack your machine via the mail servers. Despite hosting dozens of domains, I don't host email at all. I've farmed all of that off to Google Mail and I recommend everybody does something similar.\nLife is too short to worry about your email server twice a day.\n\nBut assuming you still want to install a mail server, you'll want to follow the proper guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MailServer\nThe short version is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install MTA (eg: Postfix) and configure it to allow mail in for your domain\n\n*Install MDA (eg: Dovecot) to allow people to collect their mail\n\n", "Q: How can I move the panel from the top to the bottom? I am coming from Windows 8 and want to test new Ubuntu 12.xx.\nHow can i change the position of the panel from top to bottom?\n\nA: Simple answer: You can't. At least not with Unity.\nMore complicated answer: Unity Desktop(and Gnome Shell) is made to be simple and look the same on every computer. If you want something that is more customisable, try for example KDE or XFCE, which you can install through the software centre. Then you can set the desktop environment you want to use from the login screen.\n\nA: Regarding moving the panel in Unity: comment #2 in Movement of Unity launcher has this:  \n\nI think the report actually meant that the launcher should be movable\n  to other edges of the screen. I'm afraid that won't work with our\n  broader design goals, so we won't implement that. We want the launcher\n  always close to the Ubuntu button.\nstatus wontfix\nMark\n\nAFAIK, that's how it still is.  \n\nA: \"Super+Alt+Right-click\" on the top panel and select \"properties\".\n\nChoose \"Orientation\" from it.\n\n\nA: You cannot move the panel from the top to the bottom using the default Unity desktop. \nIf you install gnome-shell from Ubuntu Software Centre and use gnome classic desktop (by selecting it from the login menu) then you can move the panel as described in the other answers.\n\nA: Here it is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install CCSM,\n\n*Install Fbpanel,\n\n*Go intoto Startup applications and add Fbpanel to startup,\n\n*Go into CCSM (Compiz Config Settings Manager) and disable the Unity\nplugin,\n\n*Power off your device. Upon restart you should have the Fbpanel as bottom panel  \nand no Unity panels.\n\n*Customize Fbpanel, all you need to edit is in this file:\nhttp://fbpanel.sourceforge.net/configs/default\nThat's is it! \nLater edit: initially the shutdown restart and lock may not work but\ni uploaded my config file on google drive with repaired commands:\nhttp://www.editmedia.ro/2014/04/move-unity-bar-to-bottom-disable.html\n\n\nA: (Assuming you're using the Classic desktop) you can just Super-Alt-Drag the panels.\nIf you're using Unity, you can't customise this. If it's something you need, I'd strongly suggest trying the classic desktop.\n\nA: Execute this in a terminal (Unity):\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher launcher-position Bottom\n\n\nA: Due to long-term design goals for the default Ubuntu desktop, you can't arrange desktop components like that. However, we have lots of different desktops in Ubuntu that have many different features like that.

Recently, I discovered that, Unity lenses can access Internet to fetch information. Such as Video lens. But I want to disable that feature, since It is no use to me.\nCan I disable access to Internet by Unity Video lens? If yes, How?\n\nA: I have found a solution recently, though not very glorious enough, but it works.\nDisable the file responsible for accessing Internet:\n\n*\n\n*First Open a terminal, go to \"/usr/lib/unity-scope-video-remote\" by the below command:\n  cd /usr/lib/unity-scope-video-remote\n\n\n\n*Disable the \"unity-scope-video-remote\" file there by this command below:\n  sudo mv unity-scope-video-remote unity-scope-video-remote.bak\n\n\n\n*Logout and Login again, to see that the video lens is unable to access the Internet.\nIf you want to re-enable the feature:\n\n*\n\n*Just do the opposite of the above process, Go to \"/usr/lib/unity-scope-video-remote\" by the command:\n  cd /usr/lib/unity-scope-video-remote\n\n\n\n*Re-enable the file by following command:\n  sudo mv unity-scope-video-remote.bak unity-scope-video-remote\n\n\n\n*Logout and Login again, to see the effect\n13.04 (64-bit)\n\n*\n\n*In 13.04 the file is in a different directory.  Using bash's brace expansion, the command is:\n  sudo mv /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/unity-lens-video/unity-scope-video-remote{,.bak}\n\n\n\n*Re-enable the file by following command:\n  sudo mv /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/unity-lens-video/unity-scope-video-remote{.bak,}\n\n\n\n*As an alternative to logging in and out just press Alt+F2 and type unity --replace\nWill it disable the local video searching?\nNo, In this procedure, the local videos will always be visible. So, no worry !\n\nA: How to deactivate the Online Videos scope\nThis is as simple as removing the unity-scope-video-remote package, whose only function is to provide online video \"recommendations\" (see below) and searches. Open the terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T, and type:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove unity-scope-video-remote\n\nThen logout once and log back in; online videos should be gone.\nRight now, Online Videos/Recommendations has NO relation to you\n\n\n*\n\n*Looking at the source code for this package shows that it eventually intends to use the Zeitgeist service database to come up with \"recommendations\"; Zeitgeist logs events, history, etc. and also enables the search-as-you-type in the dash feature. Here's a more detailed article.\n\n*But as of Ubuntu 12.04, this isn't functional and the \"recommendations\" have no relation to you, your activities or your habits; they are simply sent from the Ubuntu video search server, either alphabetically or randomly:\n\ndef update_recommendations(self):\n    \"\"\"Query the server for 'recommendations'.\n    In v0, that means simply do an empty search.\n\n\nA: For 12.10\nIn 12.10, disabling online video results in Dash is made easier. Just search for Privacy in Dash and open this window.\n\nThen turn off the option for Include online search results.\n", "Q: Why does Wine crash when trying to install the VMware vSphere client? I'm trying to install VMware client on my Ubuntu with Wine but I'm getting errors during install:\n\nwine program crash internal errors invalid parameters received.\n\nIt seems is a Wine issue but I don't really know how to debug it.\n\nA: *\n\n*vSphere Client is known to be incompatible with Wine.\n\n*This VMware KnowledgeBase article advises using the web version of the client instead, which is somewhat limited, and discusses the differences.\n\n*Unfortunately, the only practical way of running the Client on Ubuntu appears to be inside a Windows virtual machine.\n", "Q: Why does Wubi fail to boot after removing the NTFS package? First of all, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 from WinXP and booted onto it.\nI didn't find my NTFS (later I discovered that it was mounted to /host) and did 'apt-get install ntfs-3g ntfs-config'. This turned into conflict as NTFS was already mounted and I decided to remove these packages.\nNow I can't boot into Ubuntu as 'mount' fails.\nWhat to do?\n\nA: Sorry, but uninstalling and reinstalling Wubi from within Windows XP is the easiest way to fix \nthis. \n\nNote: Uninstall/reinstall will delete your Wubi, including any user data (documents, etc.). One way to prevent that is to move/copy the root.disk file to another directory on the NTFS (C:) drive from Windows. After you reinstall Wubi, you can then mount root.disk and copy user data off of it.\n\nAlternately, you would have to boot from a LiveCD, loop-mount Wubi's root.disk, chroot into it and then reinstall the NTFS packages. Hopefully that should work, but giving you step by step advice is beyond the scope of this answer. \n", "Q: How would you unsuspend a computer using a bash script?

The only fix I have ever found is by installing fglrx alongside the open source driver. While the card is not supported in the latest versions of Catalyst, the installation of the driver fixes whatever modeset is causing the buffer error (what I call the drawing of all of those lines).\nDisabling modeset (with nomodeset) will also disable your ability to scale your framebuffer, but that might not be an issue for you.\n\nA: Lets get through some steps,\nPlease download the graphics driver form here\nFor installation see here ATI RS690m X1200 proprietary driver installation\nPlease make sure following libraries are installed \n\n\n*\n\n*XFree86-Mesa-libGL \n\n*libstdc++ \n\n*libgcc \n\n*XFree86-libs \n\n*fontconfig \n\n*freetype \n\n*zlib \n\n*gcc  \n\n\nA: I have the same netbook with the same problem.\nThe proprietary drivers wont work because they only work with kernel 2.6.28 and older.\n\nATI/AMD dropped Catalyst support for these cards in Catalyst 9-4. These cards are supported with the legacy ATI 9-3 Catalyst release, but you MUST use a kernel <= 2.6.28 and Xserver <= 1.5\n\nSo after a while, I found this.\nYou have to add nomodeset on GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nfind the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nand change it to\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n\nsave the file and do\nsudo update-grub\n\nthen reboot and you'll have your desktop.\nThe only thing that I can't find yet is how to enable the effects.\n\nA: I'd suggest that you try Ubuntu from a Live USB just to see if this issue is still there when you run Ubuntu live or if it's something that appears when you install via Wubi. I know Wubi installs can be a bit dodgy sometimes, and issues might disappear if you actually do a \"clean\" install of Ubuntu on the hdd.\nIf you want to keep Windows, you can still choose this during the USB install and Ubuntu will create a separate partition for Ubuntu to use.

Do you want to know/change the default settings that come installed with KDE installation?\nThey will be present in default settings directories of KDE package. Now, you can read these links below to get an idea of how KDE settings are stored, if that's what you wanted.\nhttp://techbase.kde.org/KDE_System_Administration/KDE_Filesystem_Hierarchy\nIn the above link, you can read the Directory Tree section to know where the settings are stored for various config files, including wallpapers you want.\nThese are links to some places where people tweaked with the config files a little:\nhttp://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=88295\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=83938\nhttp://www.kde-forum.org/artikel/7675/where-are-fonts-and-colors-settings-stored.html\nhttp://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?t=32239\nIf you wanted to just change the settings, you might have heard about systemsettings-kde4 package before...

Using the quickly ubuntu-application template (i.e. python and GTK3), what solutions exist to display a text editor in which I can highlight some parts of the text and add annotations/extra visuals at some places?\nThe idea is to have a component where the user can type in text and as he does so there are some annotations schown (similar to syntax highlighting).\nThe editor does not have to be a rich text editor or anything like an office application, just a text editor would be fine.\n\nA: The two most-used text widgets are Gnome's native text widget, and Scintilla. Each do rich text but are often used for plain text. I'm sure they both handle highlighting, can be programmed to include annotation and comment text, and are able to incorporate graphic objects. \nGTKText is the text widget in PyGTK; see http://www.pygtk.org/pygtktutorial/ch-textwidget.html et al. \nScintilla is used widely in GTK and Windows, at least; here it is: http://www.scintilla.org/ in its own website. \nExactly how this is used with Quickly, I'm not certain -- but if are writing GUI code for a Quickly app, these links will at least give you an idea of what's out there. \nBest of luck!\n", "Q: Xubuntu slow login, unable to go back to login screen.

You can apply all updates from a terminal instead of the update manager by running\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y\n\nSecondly, please have a look at I have a hardware detection problem, what logs do I need to look into?, we need to know if your wireless card is detected at all. Has it worked before, or has it never worked?\nIf you help us get a more complete picture of your problem we can help you a lot quicker.\n", "Q: Will installing a program from the Software Center also include updates from its PPA? For example I installed VLC from the Ubuntu Software Center would it also include VLC's PPA repository so that when my laptop would do a software update, VLC updates would automatically be included for updates? Or should I manually add VLC's repository via terminal despite installing VLC through the Software Center?\n\nA: No, installing a program from the Software Center will not automatically include the PPA\nIf you want updated versions of e.g., VLC, that are only available in the PPAs and not in the official repositories, you will have to add the PPAs manually, regardless of whether you have already installed VLC from the Software Center or not.\nNow, once you have added the PPA, Software center will use it to update those particular programs.\n\nWarning: While the software in PPAs is often newer, it may also be unstable, partially incompatible, etc. -- remember that it has not been extensively tested by the Ubuntu team as the official versions are.\nPlease see these related questions for details about PPAs:  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n  \n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n\n\nA: Typically apt does include PPA repositories if the PPA has a newer version available, and Ubuntu Software Center uses APT, so if the PPA has a newer version, it will use the PPA. If the PPA has a older version, it will use the repository with the newer version.\n", "Q: Quickly User Dialog error I think there is an error in the Quickly tutorial. In the User Dialog section, the tutorial instructs users to enter:\ntitle = saver.title_text\nin the save dialog method. This gives some error which is fixed by using:\ntitle = save.title_text()\n\nA: This is not an error, you just need to add @property to the line above the title_txt method. So, your code should look like this:\n@property\ndef title_text(self):\n    return self.ui.entry1.get_text()\n\nThis should be placed in the SaveDialog class in the SaveDialog.py file.

I had checked my system monitory --> processes, and to my surprise Shutter was using a big chunk of my memory 2.1GB out of my 3.8GB total memory so I had to end the app. Kindly note I was not using Shutter at the time of the freeze.\nIt seems like including it on my startup applications list is a factor in this problem. Is there a way to solve this without having to give it up on startup apps list?\nI'm using 12.04 64-bit on my ThinkPad R61i. (if this would help)\n\nA: Since the title of this question is about shutter memory usage, I'll add my 2¢:\nI use shutter heavily. After noticing huge memory usage, like 4GB or more, I tried restarting, but the usage always came back.\nThen I noticed that it has the notion of a session -- you may need to periodically click File -> Close All, then restart (e.g. File -> Quit, reopen), to clear up the memory usage.\nMaybe this is obvious to some, but the other screencap programs I've used don't have the notion of a persistent session, so this caught me off guard.\n\nA: You could try starting Shutter with a delay.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go the the startup applications dialog, choose Shutter and hit Edit.\n\n*Put sleep 8s && before the value in the Command field.\n\n*Hit Save.\n\n\n\n\nI'm using ScreenCloud in this example because I don't have Shutter in my startup applications.\n", "Q: Why doesn't the delete key move a file to the trash?

The file has 3 sections now:\n\n\n*\n\n*request headers\n\n*response headers\n\n*response body\n\n\nThe response body is to become an flv file, but now everything is saved as a single file. So I need a way to delete the first two sections from the file, but the problem is that the file is very big (over a thousand mega bytes). I have tried to open it with gedit, but no matter how long I wait, gedit hangs and remains unresponsive until I kill it.\nWhat tool can I use to edit this big file easily?\n\nA: I doubt if Wireshark output that I am assuming to be a pcap file can be \"nicely\" divided into sections like request, response and body. The file would be a sequence of packets containing everything captured from the link layer onwards each prepended by a Wireshark header. Decoding the session that contributed to the transfer of say a big video file will require analyzing headers from the network protocol stack like IP, TCP and HTTP and combining the application level payload (e.g., HTTP).\n", "Q: Unity alert sound stuck on bark On a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04, using the unity-2d desktop, I changed the alert sound to a bark and now I can't change it back to anything else.  In Sound Settings, under the \"Sound Effects\" tab, in the \"Choose an alert sound\" list, I select \"default\" or \"glass\" or \"sonar\" but I still get barks.\nI'm testing by hitting backspace at a terminal prompt in gnome-terminal.\nCan anyone tell me how to get rid of the dog?\n\nA: Try renaming the file bark.ogg change the alert sound, and then rename the file back.  All this needs to happen as root.  You may have to restart your machine.\nAlso make sure that you set the volume past the mid point to get alert sounds to kick in\nIf that doesn't work, try creating a new entry in Startup Applications, as below.  Use any of the files in /usr/share/sounds/gnome/default/alerts or use your own file, but place it in the same location.  \nAlso see this question\nThis may or may not work, but its worth a shot.  You can try adding it in the Startup Application preferences.

I have a linode account when i click on DNS manager then edit my domain name there is a section that says Mail Server and written as mail.mydomain.com . Does that mean linode comes with a email server and i dont have to install one?\nAlso if i do need to install one when installing postfix it asks for a fully qualified domain name, im always unsure what to put for this one. would it be mail.mydomain.com or the default one that comes with linode which is in this format:\nlixxx-xx.members.linode.com or the domain i want to use like mydomain.com\n\nA: Linode DNS Manager, as the name implies, only manages your DNS records. There are several types of DNS records, one of which is MX or mail exchanger. You can set up your mail server address and name here. Linode does not (to my understading) set up a functional mail server for you, it your responsibility to configure and maintain one.\nWhen setting up postfix, you should put in the same information as is in DNS for your domain. In any case, you can't run a mail server for the linode.com domain, and very likely not for any subdomains either, including lixxx-xx.members.linode.com.\nGiven your confusion about the matter, I'd suggest you study DNS and SMTP in general, and your mail server in particular. Any active mail server (i.e. anything answering on port 25 or 587) will be tried for possibilities of sending spam, and that will succeed for quite slight misconfigurations.\n", "Q: T901 Fujitsu Touch Screen Disable Hand Touch I have a T901 Fujitsu with a touch screen and I want to disable the hand input, but leave the input from the pen so I can easily write on my screen without my hand interfering. Does anyone know of a simple(ish) way of doing this?\n\nA: Hope you're still interested in the answer: yes, there is a very easy way to do this. The trick is xsetwacom, the programme that takes care of most touch screen related stuff.\nIf you enter xsetwacom --list devices in a terminal, a list should show up with the different touch screen devices on your computer. For me it shows:\ntomas@EliteBook:~$ xsetwacom --list devices\nSerial Wacom Tablet stylus          id: 16  type: STYLUS    \nSerial Wacom Tablet eraser          id: 18  type: ERASER    \nSerial Wacom Tablet touch           id: 19  type: TOUCH   \n\nAll you should need to do is turn the Touch parameter off for one of these devices (it worked for me whether I did it for the stylus or the touch). In my case I enter: \nxsetwacom --set 19 touch off\n\nYou might want to replace the number with whatever shows up on your computer, or better yet, the name of the device in \"quotes\", as the number might change when other devices have been connected to your computer . If you turn that into a script, you could even bind it to a shortkey through e.g. CCSM.\nHope the information is still useful for you, please let me know if it is and explain why not if it isn't.\n", "Q: Skype not present after installing I've downloaded skype for ubuntu, but after several attempts at installing it, and ubuntu even telling me it has been installed, it is nowhere to be found.\nThis either means that ubuntu has hidden it, or that ubuntu has in fact not installed it.

How do I remotely control another desktop (both are Ubuntu 12.04) from my client machine?\nIs it possible to use Remmina Remote Desktop Client? \n\nA: Overview of Solution\nYou need to change some settings on your host machine (to enable desktop control) and create a Remote Desktop Client profile on your client machine in order to connect to the host machine and ultimately view and control the host machine's desktop.\nAnd yes, it is possible to use Remmina Remote Desktop Client on your client machine.\nEnable Remote Control of Host Machine\nDo the following on the host machine:\nvino-preferences\n\n\n*\n\n*vino-preferences also in Dash under Desktop Sharing\n\n\n*\n\n*Tick Allow other users to view your desktop\n\n*Tick Allow other users to control your desktop\n\n*Tick Require the user to enter this password\n\n*Enter a difficult to guess passphrase\n\n*Close\n\nCreate Remote Desktop Client profile on your Client Machine\nDo the following on the client machine:\nremmina\n\n\n*\n\n*remmina also in Dash under Remmina Remote Desktop Client\nCtrl+N or Connection > New\n\n\n*\n\n*Fill in your IP address [123.123.12.3] where it says Server\n\n*Connect\n\nView and Control Host Machine\nOn the client machine, when asked for the VNC password, enter the passphrase you previously entered into the host machine.\nIf successful at this step, you should now be viewing and controlling the host machine's desktop from your client machine.\n\nA: First, you need to allow the compter you want to remotely control to be controlled. Launch Remote Control Preferences, and allow Ubuntu to be remotely controlled. You can also set a password if you want. You can now control that computer remotely from another Ubuntu computer. Make sure to choose the VNC protocol when connecting to the computer. If you would like to control Windows 7 from Ubuntu, you need to choose the RDP protocol (You will need to have remote control allowed on the Windows 7 computer).\n\nA: Some machines will ask whether you want to allow connections on the server, during the client connection, live, such that if you don't actually see it happening, it might not work.\nSecondly, if you plan to connect Ubuntu and Windows 7 machines, you must select the RDP option, otherwise, eg, Ubuntu to Ubuntu connections will use VNC.\nFinally, depending on how your network is set up, you might have to use host names, IPs or FQDNs. Check them all before freaking out, as this will save you some time.\nAs an added bonus, there is also a trick to connect remote desktop connections behind networks where port forwards are needed to connect to machines behind the entry point. For example, if you have an access point of host.domain.com and it connects to a server on the network, you can set up a port forward using SSH, and then specify the RDP or VNC post like so (in putty for RDP on WIndows 7, this would be the example):\nSource: 8585 (or whatever port you want)\nDestination: 192.168.x.x:3389 (where x.x is your network)\n\nThen, when using RDC in Windows, for example, you would use localhost:8585 as the server name and voila. This can work on Linux too, with a command like:\nssh -i /path/to/key -L 8585:192.168.x.x:3389 user@host.domain.com\n\n\nA: I have been using Remmina, and I'm very happy with it.

The disadvantage - to uninstall I have to remove sth from /usr/ I think, but I'm not sure. Are there any other disadvantages/advantages?\n\nA: Well i can say compiling from source is an unsupported method of installing software because it bypasses the Package Management System (APT, USC) completely. \nAlso it affects system Stability, could break other dependencies . Since Ubuntu Packagers makes sure its all round effectiveness and integration to current system remains intact , therefore installing from official Repositories is recommended.\nAlso for further reading , refer this and this. \n\nA: When installing from source, it will typically install into /usr/local/ rather than /usr (so as not to install conflict with system libraries.  This is typically picked up first in paths, so what's in /usr/local/ will always be used first.  So if you upgrade and get a newer conky from Ubuntu, when you try to run it, it'll run the old one from /usr/local/ instead.

I am developing a program using quickly. I am using an indicator which can hide/show the main window.\nBut when I launch the application from the launcher it starts a new instance of that application (so an additional indicator will be shown). Rather than just showing the main window of the previous running app.\nWhat's the usual way of forcing only one indicator?\n\nA: First, make sure you have a good reason to do this. People expect applications to work as you describe in your post. Even though you personally might not like it.\nBut, to answer your question, one of the easiest ways to do it is by making a file (for example in the configuration directory) at startup, which you remove when your application exits. Before starting the application, you check in your code if another instance is already active, and if so, you exit directly. If you also want to focus the active application, you need a way to do inter process communication. For example via a socket. See http://docs.python.org/library/ipc.html for more info.\n\nA: I have found an even better solution (little more complicated though). You can verify not only whether your process is running but also provide some input to it if it's already launched.

From googling it looks like since Ubuntu 8 or earlier there has been a problem with Xorg whereby mouse errors in Firefox cause this problem.\nThe error was also noticed by this user: USB mouse moves but doesn't accept left clicks\nI was able to solve the problem once by closing openbox and restarting with awesome but today that's not working. Any other ideas? Could I restart Xorg without losing everything and thereby \"restart the mouse\"?\n\nA: I have the same problem and it has nothing to do with Firefox in my case.\nIts definitely NOT a hardware problem (I've tried multiple mice). \nThe symptoms : I do \"something\" (haven't quite put my finger on it yet) that causes the left mouse button to appear stuck down (its like a MOUSE_DOWN event happened, but never a corresponding MOUSE_UP event).   \nThe stuck mouse button seems to manifest itself mostly in Intellij IDEA, which basically becomes unusable.   \nI generally have the following three programs running at all times : \n\n\n*\n\n*Intellij IDEA\n\n*Virtual Box (usually running a few windows VMs)\n\n*Chromium \n\n\nTo solve the problem, I end up having to reboot (which kills a lot of time, because I have to alsy cycle the VMs). \nAs far as what triggers this problem - it is somewhat hard to determine but I think it may have something to do with using the mousewheel while the focus is on one of the virtual box VMs. \nOne other thing I've noticed is that the problem only seems to happen in Unity.  If I choose Gnome shell then I've not had the issue (but I end up coming back to Unity since its grown on me). \n\nA: @algebralives:\nAs it turned out Firefox was causing this problem. Going into a VT (Ctrl+Alt+F6, login, ls, top to orient yourself) and killall firefox fixed the problem.\n(If after a minute or two firefox has not died, do top -u algebralives in the VT and look for the process id (PID, leftmost column) associated with the word firefox in the top screen. Hit the letter q whilst the line with firefox in it is still visible, then try kill -9 82734 (assuming 82734 was the PID number associated with Firefox). The -9 has to do with which internal kill code the wider system process sends to the specific firefox daemon process. Nine meaning: no really, seriously, kill it.)\nHowever I hate risking the loss of whatever windows & tabs I have open in my firefox session. Most of the web browsers do not have perfect session management. So since I have plenty of space on this computer, from the virtual terminal (see above) I copied ~/.cache/firefox/ and ~/.config/firefox/ (but not ~/.mozilla/) to a new directory (like cd ~; mkdir firefoxbackup) before killall firefox.\nThen I restart Firefox and if it forgot all of my session info, instead of punching through the drywall I just copy ~/firefoxbackup/.cache/firefox/ and ~/firefoxbackup/.config/firefox/ back onto where they were and my session should be as it was.\n\nA: Hit Ctrl+Alt+F6 (switch in console mode), and after Ctrl+Alt+F7 for return in graphic mode (my mouse has always start to work again).\n", "Q: No space left on hard drive I'm trying to copy/move files to an external 1 TB hard drive with about 50 GB remaining space. I receive a \"no space left on disk\" when I try. \nI've moved files off and retried, but still get the same message. Disk Usage Analyzer, Properties, and freeware Treesize all report available hard drive space of about 50 GB.\nI've tried df -i (50 GB available) and df -k, with the latter reporting only 1% of inode usage. \nI've been able to save files from Firefox to the drive also. I can't even rename files without getting the message. Yesterday in the midst of trying to figure this out I tried to move 4 files to the drive and got the message.  Today, I found them on the drive.  What's up with that?\n(That's the only time that has happened to my knowledge.)\nIs this an Ubuntu problem? or is my hard drive just about to fail because of something like a controller problem?\n\nA: You have 5% reserved space on your drive, which can only be used by root.

It should work. Unless that PPA is not working now, In that case, You are very unlucky now)\n\n\n*If you disable any repository, most probably the updates repository, you should enable that repository and do sudo apt-get update and try again with your command. It should work fine.\n", "Q: How to hide a GTK window in Python before call or os.system So, I'm depeloping a Python/GTK app which, after showing an assistant, it hides the assistant's window and runs an external app. The problem is that window.hide() doesn't works if, after the command, there's an app call using os.system() or call(). When the call is done, the window seems to hang and it doesn't disappears until all the calls are done. So... what can be done?\n\nA: After some time googling possible solutions, I've found this simple answer, which waits to GTK until it finished all its working tasks.

Everything worked seamlessly, save for the brightness control. I couldn't change the screen brightness from the hardware buttons, nor from the system preferences.\nTo fix it, I used the instructions here: MacbookPro 5-5 LCD Brightness Control\nAt #2, I restarted my laptop, only to see that it went straight to the Ubuntu Startup Screen, with the 5 orange dots (Usually they all startoff white, then turn orange to indicate progress). From there, I tried controlling the brightness from the keyboard, and it worked, but sadly, my computer is still stuck on the loading screen.\n(Yes, I have tried manually restarting it)\nCould you please help?\nThank you in advance\n\nA: Sometimes the graphical login hangs, while you could read an errormessage in the commandline, which indicates to hit the S or the Enter key, which isn't propagated to the graphical login. \nSo you can watch you HDD-led (Macbooks have such a thing too, do they?) to settle, which indicates, no loading and logging is going on and just hit those keys for good luck, keeping an eye on the LED to check if it has influence. \nOr hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 (or F2, F3, ... F4) to get to the pure text screens. F1 should show the logging messages, with error cause as the last message(s). Alt+F7 (maybe F5) will bring you back into the graphical mode.\nOr edit grub while booting, hitting e will give you an edit line, there you can remove 'quiet' and 'splash' from the kernel options. This will keep you longer in touch with the messages, and maybe you can read more about the cause. \nNext option: Boot from a live cd, mount your system, and read the logfiles in /var/log, most recent files first, boot.log, kernel.log, syslog. \nAfaik, Grub has a minimal HDD-access build in, so maybe you can even inspect logfiles from the grub bootscreen, but I don't know from my heart what key to hit, to do so. But there should be a help message, which get's you started.\n\nA: I had the same problem, except I was not using a mac. My problem, and most others that I have seen on the net have been derived from video card drivers.\nFor me, I could not install at all. So what I did was during installation. At the menu screen (try out, install ...) I hit F6, and added nouveau.blacklist=1 to the end of what's already there, and then let the rest fall into place.\nFor me it worked.

Anyone know how to get this working for this specific wireless card?\n\nA: The official Broadcom STA/wl driver DOES NOT support monitor mode\n\n*\n\n*You are using the Broadcom STA (wl) official driver; this does not support monitor or promiscuous modes (regardless of whatever airmon-ng tells you.)\n\n*For this you need the b43 driver, which can be installed with sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer\n\n*You can unload one and load the other with sudo rmmod wl; sudo modprobe b43 (and vice versa).\n\n*Note that b43 and wl have their own advantages and disadvantages, so you may want to google before choosing one or the other.\n\n\nA: The above answer is not true. At least, from version 5.100.82.1 (I think that is from year 2007 or so).\nThe official Broadcom STA/wl driver does support monitor mode\nHowever, it's not standard the way it does, so in order to enable it you have to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to type in a 1 to the file /proc/brcm_monitor0. You may do this via the following shell command: echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/brcm_monitor0.\n\n*It will create a new interface. The interface is called prism0, and not mon0.\n\n\nEnjoy.\nIn my case, I can't set b43 up, and whenever I actually get the kernel to load it, my connectivity will drop to unusable, dropping most packets.\nI hate wl not being free, but I can't use the b43 alternative in my BCM4322.\n\nA: If you choose to use non official drivers, pay attention that it doesn't support all cards. Check it here: http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#Supported_devices\nFor example (not supported): Broadcom Corporation Device [14e4:4365]\nCheck your card:\nlspci -vnn -d 14e4:\n\n", "Q: Can I use Unity with the dash and hud only? 12.04 I love the Dash, find the hud to be cool, hates the launcher and loathes the panel!\nSo is there a way that I can run the Dash alone and use Gnome or Cinnamon or whatever as a window manager? \n\nA: If you don't like the unity launcher, you can use GNOME 3. It might be what you're looking for.\nJust go to the Software Center, and find the GNOME Desktop Environment. After you download it, log out. At the log in screen click the little Ubuntu circle logo to chose gnome, then enter password to log in.\nYou can pretty much do the same for the other desktop environments out there. Or you can use other tools like Ubuntu Tweak to change the appearance of your desktop.\n", "Q: Build failed with the command : quickly submitubuntu We try to submit our application for the ubuntushowdown contest, but when we do the command : quickly submitubuntu, the application is not submitted, we have errors such as \"build failed\".\nWe spend time about reading the log, but we are stuck, we don't know much about launchpad, can you explain us this error ?\nYou could find the log here\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: I believe you are missing a build dependency to supply the missing program.\nIt appears that you could add the package libglib2.0-bin to your build dependencies to make the program glib-compile-schemas available at build time. Apparently the program is used with Gsettings. The launchpad build process installs just the most basic packages, build dependencies declared in your debian/control file, and their dependencies, before trying to do the build. \nIf a build dependency is missing from the debian/control file an error is supposed to result as an aid to getting the build-dependencies correct.\nTo answer this, I noted the missing file, entered the command locate glib-compile-schemas  and whereis glib-compile-schemas to find the missing file, and executed the command dpkg -S glib-compile-schemas to find the name of the missing package.\nIf you don't want to compile schemas as part of the build process you will need to adjust the build process by changing debian/rules or the packages make files.\n\nA: There is a fix for this problem? I want to publish my app but I still have this error, even if I try to insert libglib on the dependencies \n", "Q: I need to create a .sh installer file I need to create a .sh installer file. I have the files, i just need to know the commands that will lead the terminal into placing the files in certain locations. there is a folder that needs to be placed in the /var directory, and a file in the /etc/init.d directory. Does anyone know what commands in the file are appropriate?\nthere is a folder that needs to be placed in the /var directory, and a file in the /etc/init.d directory. \n\nA: Basically, a shell .sh script is nothing more than the same commands you would type at the command line.  For instance, if your files are \"a.sh, b.txt, c.conf\" and they need to reside in /var, and \"d.sh\" goes in \"/etc/init.d\", then you would do something like this:\ncp a.sh /var\ncp b.txt /var\ncp c.conf /var\ncp d.sh /etc/init.d\n\nThat assumes the installer file is separate from the other files.  If you need to make a single unified installer script that contains these file, then you'll want to look a \"shar\" file (short for \"Shell Archive\").\nA shar file can also setup permissions and take other actions that might be necessary for your installation.  You can use the chown and chmod command as necessary in the install script you write, too.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make almost all video files work on Ubuntu using a media player, or a codec installation pack? I used to use Media Player Classic in Windows and it played everything!\nI've installed VLC on my Ubuntu 12.04 system and while it plays 99% of the files I try to play on it, there are these video files from a Coursera torrent that I'm trying to play but the audio is cracking a LOT!\nThe same file, when played on VLC or Media Player Classic on Windows, plays with very minimal cracks in audio and is considerably better and also audible.\nI was wondering if there's some all-in-one codec pack like K-lite pack (or media player classic) for windows that will take care of my problem?\n\nA: You can install ubuntu-restricted-extras from the Software center.  This installs all the non-free codecs for almost everything.\n\nA: Open termina; (Ctrl + Alt + T) and run this command\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n", "Q: What is apt and aptitude in Ubuntu? I've been blindly copy pasting code that contains these keywords to install programs and having migrated from Windows, I don't quite understand what they mean. Can anyone explain them and their significance with their similarities/differences?\nAlso, I would like to know how do you know the answer to this question? I mean, since I am learning to use Ubuntu now from barely any prior experience, how should I have know this answer? Where should I have looked for it, apart from Googling, which I tried only to find answers not satisfying/clear enough.\n\nA: Apt and aptitude are command-line software tools to manage application packages. Essentially they install and remove software. If you're new to ubuntu you shouldn't really need to use them at all, because the ubuntu software center is the graphical application to take care of such things.\n\nA: As Garry says, they're applications that install and remove software from Ubuntu's software repositories, amongst other tasks. If you've no idea what that means, let's step back one further:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software (like Firefox, GIMP, xchat, etc) is compiled and then packaged into *.deb files.\n\n*These debs are essentially installers. They contain all the files that get copied into the system as well as scripts that allow it to depend on (or conflict with) other known packages.\n\n*If you install Firefox from a package, apt and dpkg (the applications that processes the dependencies) will make sure you have its dependencies installed first and if you haven't, it'll grab those packages too.\n\n*Packages are stored in online repositories as big lists.\n\n*Apt is the tool (or set of tools) that downloads all these lists from various sources, combines them and allows you to select certain packages for installation.\n\n*The benefit to all this is you can install a lot of software without having to hunt for it. More than that, the software in the official Ubuntu repositories is maintained so that if security fixes are released, they're applied and a new package is created. When apt next checks for updates, it sees the new version and you're prompted to download it.\n\n\nI won't say apt-get/aptitude are useless because they're not, they're both very powerful utilities and like a lot of CLI-vs-GUI comparisons, if you know how to use them, they're a good deal faster than the Software Center.\nBut punching in random commands without knowing what to expect is a recipe for disaster. It only takes one bad/clumsey person to suggest a destructive command and you'll nuke your system. If you don't know what something's going to do either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask.\n\n*Run man <command> (eg man apt-get) to see the manual page for a specific application.\n\n\nThe command line in Linux systems is a good few hundred thousand times more powerful than it's Windows counterpart. You have to treat it with respect or it will bite your legs off.\n", "Q: I messed up grub ubuntu 12.04 I was playing around with super boot manager and it's pretty gui features, and ended up messing up everything. I had it working really well before I started messing with super boot manager.\nPrevious grub/burg setup had Ubuntu, Fedora, and Windows 7 in it. But now it only shows Windows.\nThe last thing I did was apply a fix to the grub2 via super boot manager(shouldn't have done that).\nI am able to get to the grub terminal from burg, but I don't know any commands from there. If I could at least boot into ubuntu I'm pretty sure I can fix the rest.\nCan anybody help with this?\nAlso, I can't remember the exact partition I need to get into ex: (hd0, sdb1) something like that. So some commands to get that info would help as well!\nThanks!\n\nA: I think the easiest way is to get the Boot Repair Disk, which can fix this automatically. It's saved me many times in the past. It can be done with the original Ubuntu install disk, too. And if you know the commands and your partitions, you can boot from the grub prompt, but that's not very intuitive until you've done it a few times.\n\nA: You can also boot from a Ubuntu Live CD, and install the boot-repair package via ppa. See this link for more information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n", "Q: How do I get QSystemTrayIcon to show up in Gnome 3? I can get a QSystemTrayIcon to show up in Unity by installing the sni-qt  package which acts as a broker between the application and an application indicator for the program.\nHowever, running the application under Gnome 3 doesn't work - no icon appears anywhere. Is there a similar package that does the same thing as the sni-qt package but for Gnome 3?\n\nA: The QSystemTrayIcon you looking for is already there in GNOME 3.  The icon shows up in the messaging tray (lower right hand corner) but the messaging tray itself is not visible by design.\nI just snapped a picture to soothe you:\n\n\nA: sni-qt automatically converts Qt systray icons to Unity indicators. No packages do the same thing for Gnome Shell, but you could find an extension to have the missing icon showed in the panel.\n", "Q: \"No such file or directory\" error when trying to install pcre am using ubuntu 12.04 and am trying to install pcre however I encountered an error message when I tried to use the command:\nsudo make after the ./configure command.\nI have this error message\n/bin/sed: can't read Files/PCRE/pcre-8.30/libpcre.la: No such file or directory\nlibtool: link: `Files/PCRE/pcre-8.30/libpcre.la' is not a valid libtool archive\nmake[1]: *** [libpcreposix.la] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/dimaz/Downloads/Snort Files/PCRE/pcre-8.30'\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\n\nhow can I fix this?\n\nA: I am completely new at this, but I had the same error when trying to unpack the tarball for TeX Live on Ubuntu 12.04.\nWhat I did was open the file in the Archive Manager.

I am trying to create a  professional photography workflow in Ubuntu. I've calibrated my monitor with a Spyder 3 (works out of the box in 12.04).\nBut I need to know the file path to the monitor calibration profile that is created in the Gnome Color Manager (\"Color\" in System Settings).\nWhere is the *.icm file located? It's not in the usr/share/color directory.\nAny help would be really appreciated.\nThanks\n\nA: You can find your colour profiles as ICC files in ~/.local/share/icc. (Where ~ is your home folder).\nThe files have slightly cryptic names, but you can open them (with the ICC Profile Installer) to see a little more information. Otherwise, open the Color settings panel and click the View details button with a profile selected. The \"Filename\" field in that dialog should point you in the right direction.\n\nA: You don't have to search for it in nautilus.\nClick HERE (if the manufacturer is HP/COMPAQ-otherwise go to your monitors' website), Look up your monitor in the search bar at the top, once you get some results click on the little blue link titled \"Drivers & Software\". You should have results within the first 2-3 items in the search results. Look for the one that says \"Software\" at the far right side, click and download the \"you're_file.exe\".\nRun it, go to the directory where it extracted its content and then just copy all or just the profile you want to the \"Color\" settings directory, should be /home/YOUR_NAME/.local/share/icc (be sure to enable hidden folders from the \"View\" menu at the top). Finally open up \"Color\", add profile and in the window that opens you'll see all the profiles you placed in the directory. Hope that helps. ;-)\n\nA: Hugo's answer is related, but readers may be unaware of the difference between a downloaded ICC profile and a custom one.\nIt's becoming more common for manufacturers to generate stock ICC profiles from average data taken from an unspecified number of pre- or early production test monitors at an unspecified time in the distant past (distant in color accuracy terms is more that a month). These profiles are useful for someone who doesn't have a colorimeter or, better, a spectrophotometer. (So, better than nothing.)\nThe poster has a custom ICC profile generated by a colorimeter from his specific monitor at a given point in time. This is much better: (i) it takes into account manufacturing variances and (ii) it takes into account the changes that take place in the monitor over time.\n", "Q: HP hs2340 HSPA+ MobileBroadband on HP mini 210-4160ew mobile internet illness \n*\n\n*The hardware is recognized with success.\n\n*in iwconfig command it is: usb0\n\n*The OS is: Ubuntu 12.04 the most up to date from ubuntu site\n\n*in network manager is an info: mobile connection: not powered on\n\n*At starting of loading desktop, i'm asked to insert a PIN to unlock modem, i write PIN and nothing hapens\n\n*set up manual connection doesn't help\n\n*Internet vendor: Orange (Poland)\n\n*The card is unlocked (for sure)\n\n*WiFi and ethernet cable internet works perfectly\n\n*I'm a newbie in linux\n\n*I'm asking for the resolve of problem - step by step\n\n*I'm really sorry for my english\n\n*I don't really now what to do to have an internet on my netbook via modem\n\n\nAll the best here from Poland\n\nA: In case you have a dual boot Ubuntu / Windows, you can test if it's with the power management.\nOn Windows you can power the modem with the HP connection manager.
